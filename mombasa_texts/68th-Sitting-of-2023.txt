suffering and hinders our children` s future prospects ;

the care and rehabilitation of orphans, vulnerable  children and victims of gender -based  
violence, child trafficking, and child labour ;

WAIVER OF MEDICAL EXPENSES FOR INSECURITY VICTIMS  
 
Yes, Hon ourable  Sylvester Kai please give the Notice of Motion . 
 
Hon. Kai: I beg to give notice of the following Motion;  
 
AWARE THAT  security is the National government`s constitutional responsibility but the 
County Government h as a secondary role, including security enhancement via street lighting;  
 
FURTHER AWARE THAT  while there is coverage of many areas in the County with street 
lighting some areas do not have street lighting or have malfunctioning street lights;  
 
NOTING THAT  residents in Mombasa County are vulnerable to attacks due to insufficient 
street lighting;  
 
SERIOUSLY CONCERNED THAT  absence of adequate street lighting heightens night 
insecurity risks exposing the public to attack by gangsters especially in the suburbs;  
 
I, therefore urge this Assembly to RESOLVE :  
 
I. THAT , victims of insecurity, especially at night, receives  a 100  per cent  waiver of medical 
expenses at public hospitals in the County thus easing their financial burden and promoting 
community safety.  
 
II.THAT the County government enhances installation and maintenance of street lighting in 
all areas, focusing on poorly lit zones, bolstering public security in partnership with the 
National government, and minimizing resident vulnerability.  
 
Thank you .
