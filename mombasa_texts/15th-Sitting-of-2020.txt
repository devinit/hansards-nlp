CONDOLENCE MESSAGE F OR THE UNTIMELY DEMI SE OF MSAMBWENI MEMB ER OF PARLIAMENT , 
THE LATE HON . SULEIMAN DORI  
 
 Honourable Members, good morning again. As you are all aware of the untimely death of 
Hon. Suleiman Dori, Member of Parliame nt Msambweni Constituency which occurred on 
Monday  9th March , 2020.  On behalf of the County Assembly, I wish to express my sincere and 
heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and Constituent s of the late Hon. Suleiman Dori. To 
Him we belong  and to Him we shall return.  Honourable Members, It is unfortunate that cancer 
has once again claimed the life of one of the most resourceful , hardworking and articulate 
Member of the 12th Parliament. It is therefore important that as a Nation we come up with 
sustain able solutions to the cancer menace which continues to affect many families and beyond.  
Honourable Members,  I would like to thank His Excellency  the Governor, Hon. Hassan 
Ali Joho for the steps he has taken towards  the fight against cancer. Through his abl e leadership 
Mombasa has established the first cancer screening center at the Coast Provincial General 
Hospital.  Honourable Members,  I believe that with the enhanced funding to the County 
government the Governor shall ensure the cancer patients will access  comprehensive care within 
the County . Honorable Members, again we pray that the Almighty  grant the soul of the late Hon. 
Suleiman Dori eternal rest in Janna tul Firdaus . Ameen.  Yes Clerk?
