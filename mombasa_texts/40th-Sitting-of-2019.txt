the following Motion : 
THAT AWARE  that the County government is  mandated by the Constitution, Fourth 
Schedule Part 2 (g) to handle refuse removal, refuse dumps and solid waste ; 
Hon. Speaker ; 
FURTHER AWARE  that the County gover nment in its endeavours to restore the glory 
of Mombasa has come up with various environmental initiatives including monthl y clean 
up exercise within the County;  
COGNIZANT  that ‘Mji wetu wajibu wetu’ , a slogan that the County uses to promote 
solid waste man agement focuses on a people driven process;  
CONCERNED that solid waste management including collection is centralized and 
hence people involvement at the Ward level is absent or  rather  limited ;

NOTING that people involvement in the solid waste collection will ensure  that 
community based group s at Ward level are empowered as solid waste collection will be a 
source of livelihood to the groups and thus reduce vices such as theft, drug and substance  
abuse  within the County ; 
 Mr. Speaker Sir, I therefore urge this County Assembly to resolve that:
