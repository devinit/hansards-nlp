yetu ya  mwaka , kama tulipoipitisha mwezi wa tatu. Lakini miongoni mwa sababu kuu 
Mheshimiwa Spika ya kuwe na nafasi ya ku ahirisha vikao ni katika kutekeleza yale majukumu 
yetu yalioko kikatiba ya kwamba sisi tukiwa wa wakilishi wa wananchi . Mheshimiwa Spika , 
vilevile lazima tuwe na fursa na wakati wa kurudi kwa wananchi waliotupatia nafasi hizi 
kuwawakilisha kuweza  kuregesha ripoti ya yale yanayojiri yale tulioweza kuwakilisha na yale 
yalioweza kutendeka ama yanasubiri kutendewa haki kama jukumu alilotupatia . Lakini pia 
Mheshimiwa Spika likizo hii imekuja wakati ambapo kama taifa tunatarajia mvua kubwa za El 
Nino na katika maandalizi mojawapo ni kuwahamasisha watu wetu ya ku chuku a tahadhari na 
kuwa katika mazingira ambayo maeneo ambayo watakuwa salama iwapo Mwenyezi Mungu 
atajalia mvu a hizi kuweza kunyesha kwa wingi . Lakini pia tukimuomba Mwenyezi Mungu ajalie 
mvua zenye baraka na zisiwe zenye madhara tuwe nyanjani kuweza kuhamasisha watu wetu 
kuchukua tahadhari hizo.  
Vilevile Mheshimiwa Spika tunakumbuka ya kwamba hivi majuzi aliweza kuzindua 
mtunange wa soccer katika mojawapo ya kupatia shughuli vijana wetu lakini pia kuboresha ama 
kuweza kuhakikisha ama ni na usalama unapatikana katika maeneo . Mheshimiwa Spika kwa zile 
kata ndogo zilizobahatika kuvuka awamu hii ya makundi na kwenda awamu ya kumi na sita 
ikiwemo waliojaliwa na vipaji vijana wangu nawakilisha kata ndogo ya Likoni tuko katika 
msururu juma lijalo la kucheza ingwe hii . Hivyo basi ni fursa v ilevile Mheshimiwa Spika kwa 
wale Waheshimiwa ambao wameweza kuvuka na timu zao kuweza ziandaa inavyostahili  lakini 
kwa wale ambao kwa bahati mbaya waliishia magrupuni kwa kuchachagwa tukiwap a pole 
tunawasihi pia waweze kuungana na sisi kushabikia sisi videdea .
