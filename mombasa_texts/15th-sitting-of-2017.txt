(Deputy Speaker (Hon. Mswabah Rashid) read the letter)  
OUTSTANDING PAYMENTS TO MARKETING AFRICA FOR MOMBASA QUIZ NI TE 
YEAR 2014  
 Hon Deputy Speaker sir,  due to circumstance s beyond my control,  am forwarding 
herewith documents as above captioned for your perusal and guidance regarding offsetting of the 
bill quoted herein.   
 M/s Marketin g Africa have forwarded to the C ounty Assembly of Mombasa a claim of 
Kshs  696,000.00 for a Mombasa quiz  nite event that was held on a Friday 29th August 2014  at 
Sarova White S ands.  
 There have been a lot of follow ups and complain ts about the long overdue non -payment 
not only from the eventâ€™s organizers  but also other stakeholders who feel that we are being 
unreasonable and unfair for not settling the bil l.  
 However , on scrutiny  of the available document s we have been unable to trace the 
following ; first the  invitation  letter for the eve nt, two  the approval to attend the event by the 
AIE h older at that time and three a n LSO  authorizing  the event organizing  to carry on with the 
exercise.  
 In the circumstance we propose that this matter be announced in the House  because of 
interest  of som e of the M embers and at the same time the matter be forwarded to the Public 
Accounts  Committee for thorough investigation s and advice regarding whether  the A ssembly 
can pay or not so as to settle this matter once and for all.  
 Meanwhile  we note that an at tendance  list has  been provided and a published magazine 
with pictorial of the C ounty assembly fraternity, hence  leaving behind a maze for discovery and 
scrutiny so as to establish the truth.   
 Hon Speaker sir kindly intervene  as this matter is complicated  and beyond my decision. 
 Yours o bediently Salim Juma,  County Assembly Clerk . 
(End of communication from the Chair)  
 This letter is forwarded  to the  Committee on  Public Account C ommittee , thank you.  Yes 
Clerk.
