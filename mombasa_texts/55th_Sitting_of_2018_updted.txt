DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor Page 2 Hon. Murfad Amur:  Thank you Mr. Speaker . Mr. Speaker the petition has arrived in the  
Committee concerned about environment should do a site visit and before that this Assembly 
should write to N EMA  because if there is anything that  license was given then N EMA  must be 
the one who authorized  that clinker. So we need to get the information whether they were given a 
licence or no t, but it is important for the C ommittee to go and do site visit and gather proper 
information so that the families of the people who are  living there cannot  go through that kind of 
problem Mr. Speaker. Thank you . 
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Hon. Thoya.  
Hon. Thoya:  Thank you Mr. Speaker, Kikaangoni is in Mikindani and am happy that the 
petiti on has come through the plenary; it  is my plea  that the concerned Committee of 
Environment and Health do visit that place, I really do  not need to give much more information 
but th e concerned C ommittee, at the moment  those residen ts of Kikaangoni C ambodia are using 
a lot of money taking their infants and other people who were infected to hospita l and it is over 
two months now.  Thank  you. 
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Hon. Nyiro.  
Hon. Nyiro:  Thank you Mr. Speaker.  I think I sit in the Environmental Committee and 
Hon. Amur has requested may be we have a site visit so may be if that request is going to be 
granted through my Chair maybe  we can have a consultation may be after this so that we can see 
how we can do the site visit as we also gather information from the NEMA  people so that we can 
make sure we bring a good feedback to this House. O therwise it is very worrying that our people 
are still going through such an era where people put businesses without considering the health 
effect  of the business they are doing;  they are only after making money while killing the 
population around their businesses so  it is something we are going to have a very serious look at 
and then will bring recommendations through our able Chair Mr. Mukono who has new energy 
from Tanzania.  
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Hon. Mary Osongo.  
Hon. (Ms.) Osongo:  Thank you Mr. Speaker, concerning the petition I think the 
Committee s concerned, the E nvironment and Health should be combined together and then they 
go and see what is happening there, I think that one will give us something what to do.  
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Sorry.  
Hon. (Ms.) Osongo:  Am saying if the Health and  Environment  Committees have  gone 
they will tell us what to do about the area.  
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Hon. Salim Kalume.  
Hon. Kalume:  Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika . Mimi ikiwa ni Mwanachama wa K amati ya 
mazingira  ninge muomba Mwenyekiti  wangu na Wanachama  wote tufanye site visit  katika hii 
sehemu kwa sababu hili tatizo hili liko sana haswa katika Mombasa nzima kuna kampuni nyingi 
ambazo wamejiachilia sana inakuwa air pollution , kwa hivyo Mheshimiwa Spika ikiwezekana 
tufanye hii site visit  haraka iwezekanavyo. Ahsante.  
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Yes M embers, yes Honorable?

Kikaango ni changamoto hii iko pia pale S hireji nafikiri kidogo nimechelewa lakini kulikuwa na 
lalama ije rasmi Bungeni. K wa hivyo ningeomba ikiwa  ni Kikaangoni kisiwe kikaango peke 
yake cha Mikindani ijum uishwe Shireji pia kuna changamoto za kimazingira pamoja na afya , 
hivyo basi ningeomba B unge hili litupatie nafasi tuweze kutembelea kuzuru na tutakuja na ripoti 
kabambe na nina imani kuwa tutaweza  kufaulisha kazi hiyo Bunge hili litakalotupatia . Ahsante 
sana na vilevile Mheshimiwa S pika utaniwia radhi niko na ripoti kabambe vilevile pia Wenyekiti

Hon. (Ms.) Maimuna Salim:  Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa Spika . Mimi ningependa 
kuchangia kuhusu hiyo petition  iliyofika hapa tusiangalie sehemu moja tunajua ya kwamba kuna 
kampuni nyingi ambazo zina madhara zinadhuru watoto wetu zadhuru afya zetu kwa hivyo 
ningeomba zile Kamati husika zikiweza kufu atilizia ziangalie na  sehemu zengine ambazo ziko 
ndani ya Mombasa najua kama Jomvu  ziko, huko mahali zimetajwa Mikindani ziko, kuna 
nyengine ziko huku Shimanzi  na nyengine zote tuziweke kwa pamoja hii petition  imekuja ni 
kama kufungua muongozo ya kwamba tusiangalie  sehemu moja  alafu zikawa zinafu atilizia . Kwa 
hivyo huu ni mw anzo na ningeomba K amati zikienda zikirudi kutuletea ripoti zikifika kwa 
executive  waweze kutimiza k azi kwa sababu kuna mambo mengi , sisi tunayazungumza hapa 
tunayapitisha lakini utenda  kazi wa upande wa executive  ndio umelemea â€¦

Kwa hivyo ningependa kus ema ya kwamba sisi K amati zitafu atilizia na ripoti ikija hapa 
na iwe ya kwamba hii ni jambo ambalo ni sugu tuliangalie na tuhakikishe vile vitengo  amba vyo 
ni hus ika vimeweza kufu atilizia hii kwa sababu hii ni ya dharura kabla watu wengi hawajaweza 
kuathiriwa na hizi sumu na hizi kampuni ambazo zina madhara kwa watu wetu . Kwa hivyo mimi 
ningesema hayo na namshukuru sana alioleta hoja hii na namshukuru Mheshimiwa Spika, 
ahsante sana.  
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you . Yes Hon. Kizito Opeya please give us some 
comments on this petition.  
Hon. Opeya: Thank you Mr. Speaker . I would also want to support what Hon . Maimuna 
has said here that we should not just go around and make the report  but when it comes to 
implementation the executive does not implement it  thereby we will be doing services to our 
people, also there are other areas ; in fact my Ward there are areas where this issue is happening 
so the C ommittee should expand its mandate m aybe and go all over Mombasa and that way 
maybe they should be facilitated more so that they can be faster and bring the report to the House 
and then to mak e sure that the implementation C ommittee led by Hon. Kalume pushes the 
executive to implement whatev er is passed here, thank you.  
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Hon Kibwana Swaleh give us some comments please in 
this particular issue.  
Hon. Kibwana Swaleh :  Thank you . Mr Speaker am not going to say that you ambushed 
me but am ready  to say something on thi s issue.  Mr Speaker the issue that is before us is a very 
serious issue and I think as a Chair of health Committee I will be happy to see that we condemn 
and also take drastic measures so that we don't pollute the air so it normally cause s a lot of 
diseases and a  lot of sickness so although it may be mentioned in a certain area but I think it's our 
duty as Hon . Members to see that our environment is not polluted so as to prevent our people 
who voted for us or our commu nity to be more infected with di seases which will be not eas y for 
us to treat them . So Mr Speaker I think it is a good idea and you are welcomed and I hope that 
my Committee will be  in the  forefront to see that we condemn and also take drastic measures to 
stop this pollution. Thank you.  
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you . Yes Hon. Mwamwiri.  
Hon. Athman Mwamwiri:  Ahsante Mheshimiwa M wenyekiti kwa fursa hii . Mimi 
nasimama kwa masikitiko kutokana  na ombi hili la ndugu zetu wa Kikaangoni walilofikisha ya 
kwamba wamekuwa wakiishi katika mazingira yasio sahihi . Mheshimiwa M wenyekiti sisi kama 
Kaunti tunahusika pia katika kupeana leseni kwa baadhi ya biashara kuendeshwa kati ka K aunti 
yetu na kwa mujibu wa kanuni haifai ya biashara kuendeshwa pasi kupeana ripoti yao ya 
upembuzi ya kinifu . Kwa faida ya wanasa sauti upembuzi wa kinifu inamaanisha feasibility 
studies  kwa lugha ya kimombo; Mheshimiwa M wenyekiti upembuzi wa kinifu inapasa kuashiria 
na kuon yesha ni madhara gani ambayo kampuni zile zitakuwa zikitekeleza kwa jamii na ni jinsi 
gani wa taweza kukabiliana nazo ku weka maisha ya watu wetu na afya zao katika hali sahihi 
ikiwemo kama ni mazingira ya kupanda miti , kama ua katika maeneo yale ili kuzuilia vumbi na 
upepo kupita kuingia kwenye maeneo ya watu .

DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information

ni kuwajengea hospitali kuwa wekea matibabu ya bure kila mwezi, kupeana madawa na jinsi gani 
jamii inayoishi pale inapata athari na madhara ya uchafuzi wa mazingira wanafaidika kutokana 
na kampuni ile . Mheshimiwa M wenyekiti ukizingatia inaweza kuwa hakuna hata asilimia moja 
ama mbili ya wakaazi wa pale waliopata ajira pale tukasema wanaweza kulipia ada za matibabu 
za watu wao, pengine ni kampuni tu ilioko pale lakini waajiriwa wametoka sehemu zengine 
wenyeji wa pale w anateseka wanadho ofika na sisi kama...  
(Interruption)  
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Hon. Murfad.  
Hon. Murfad  Amur : Mr. Speaker the Hon . Member is addressing you as the C hair he 
should address you as the Speaker.  
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Yes continue Hon . Member.  
Hon. Athman Mwamwiri : Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti labda nimfahamishe S pika ni neno 
ambalo tunaliomba tunapokuja katika maneno ya Kiswahili  lakini kiufasaha ni Mheshimiwa 
Mwenyekiti â€¦ 
(Applause ) 
Hili likuingie kwa akili na wakati mwengine usipe leke aibu kwengine kumuita 
Mheshimiwa  Mwenyekiti kwa lugha ya Kiswahili ukamuita S pika utachekwa Mheshimiwaâ€¦  
(Laughter ) 
Tukiendelea Mheshimiwa  inasikitisha na kampuni hii sio moja ziko nyingi kama  
ilivyoashiriwa kwa hivyo kama Bunge Mheshimiwa M wenyekiti ni hali muhimu kuziongelea 
kampuni hizi kupata ufasaha utenda  kazi wao na ni jinsi gani waka azi wa Mombasa wanafaidika  
pale; wengineo hata wanak wepa kulipa ushuru kwa K aunti yetu, wako hapo kujitenge zea 
mamilioni lakini sisi kama K aunti hatupati lolote na wa tu wetu walio maeneo yale pia hawapati 
lolote;  sio maswala ya kielimu sio ya ajira, sio misaada ya maji sio swala la misaada ya 
kadhalika . Kwa hivyo Mheshimiwa Spika safari ile itakay o tembelewa kule na ripoti ile kama 
Bunge tutapeana mapendekezo yetu na k uiomba idara husika kuchukuwa hatua muhimu ambazo 
zitakuwa funzo na m anufaa kwa watu wetu wa Mombasa. A hsante sana Mheshimiwa  
Mwenyekiti.  
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa.  Mheshimiwa Fahad Kassim.  
Hon. Fahad Kassim : Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika kwa fursa hii . Yangu nitakuwa 
mchache wa maneno, nafikiri wenzangu viongozi wametangulia kusema na tuna imani na 
Kamati yetu ya mazing ira na afya zihusike pamoja na Justice  bila kumsahau Mheshimiwa  
Amriya tuko nae hapa aende awakilishe kama kiongozi wetu wa justice  na nina imani wakati 
wataleta hiyo ripoti tutaweza kuifanyia kazi ipasavyo, ila tu ningeomba Mheshimiwa  Spika utoe 
mwongozo hiyo kitu iweze kufanywa baina ya masaa 48 kwa sababu ni watu w etu wanaumia 
huko, wako na kilio na lazima kitatuliwe haraka iwezekanavyo kwa hivyo tuifanyieni kazi kwa 
haraka, a hsanteni sana.
