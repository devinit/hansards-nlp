  NOTING THAT  solar electricity generation represents a clean alternative to electricity 
from fossil fuels, with no air and water pollution, no gl obal warming pollution, no risks 
of electricity price spikes and no threats to our public health;  
 
 CONCERNED THAT  the climate of County is the best conditions to generate solar 
energy. It can also help in creation of job opportunity and spur economic grow th, 
generate back up power for nighttimes and outage when paired with storage and operate 
at similar efficiency on both small and large scales;  
 
 I therefore urge this Assembly to  RESOLVE  that; 
 
1. The County g overnment to come up with comprehensive and suppo rtive policy 
frameworks to ensure residents and business have fair access to clean energy technologies 
like solar.  
 
2. The County g overnment to install solar panels on all  County g overnmentsâ€™ 
rooftops across the County in place of generators.  
 
 That is my subm ission , Mr. Speaker.  
 
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Fadhili Mwalimu) : Thank you Hon. Kitula. Yes Clerk?
