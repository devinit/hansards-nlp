Page 3  Yes Hon. Renson Thoya?  
 
Hon. Thoya : Bwana Spika nashukuru kw a kuweza kunitambua na nimesimama hapa 
nikiwa nataka kujua kutoka kwa Kamati  husika ya ajira ambayo nikiwa mimi pia ninai ongoza 
na inastaajabisha kwamba Wabunge  wanaumia na hata ikiwa mimi ni Mbunge  na ni 
Mwenyekiti pia sijasazwa kwamba kuna kandarasi ambazo zinaendelea na zimepeanwa na 
Kaunti na wale wanakandarasi wame amua kuja na vijana wao kuto ka sehemu zengine na 
wanaach a wale vijana wa Mikindani bila ajira ama kuwa mashabiki tu wa  kuangalia ile kazi 
ikifanyika ambalo ni jambo ambalo limeleta utata na hata vile mumeniruhusu kuingia lakini 
ilikuwa niende huko mashinani. Hii ni kwa sababu wale vijana wame amua wasimamishe il e 
kazi isiendelee mpaka wao nao wawe ndani waweze kupata ule mlo kama wale wa tu kutoka 
sehemu nyengine mbali. Na kuomba hilo ombi nitaomba uruhusu Bwana Spika hata baada ya 
kikao hiki kama tutapata gari kwenda angalia kwa sababu kama hatutaenda hiyo kandara si 
baada ya siku tatu nne itakuwa imeisha na vijana wangu wa Mikindani watakuwa hawajapata 
chochote. Ahsante Bwana Spika.  
 
The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Any reaction to the statement? Yes Hon. 
Bwire?  
 
Hon. Bwire:  Shukran Mheshimiwa Spika . Mheshimiwa S pika mimi ninaungana na 
mwenzangu kujadili hoja hii aliyolet a ya dharura kwamba katika K atiba yetu inasemekana 
kwamba asilimia 80 ya nafasi za ajira zinafaa zitoke sehemu ile ambako kazi inafanywa na 
tabia hii tumeiona katika kila sehemu hata kwangu ilikuj a lakini tulisimamisha tukaitisha 
wale wenyeji wa pale ndio wapewe kipao mbele katika kufanya ile kazi.  Kwa hivyo itakuwa 
si jambo jema Mheshimiwa Spika endapo kazi itakuwa inafanywa ka tika eneo fulani na watu 
wanaotok ea eneo lengine kuja kufanya ile ajira . Tunataka tuelezwe ya kwamba wale vijana 
wa pale mahala ambako kazi inafanyika wao nao wapate riziki kwa njia gani? Kwa hivyo 
tunaomba Bunge hili tulichukulie hili suala kwa umakini sana na haya maneno lazima yafike 
mwisho kwa sababu ni sisi ambao tunatoa  kazi kama serikali ya Kaunti na hawa vijana wetu 
wanapoenda kufanya kazi inapofanyika Mikindani kwa mwenzangu ni wale wale vijana pia 
wa eneo hilo wapate nafasi ya kufanya ajira ili na wao pia wapate riziki zao za kila siku. 
Shukrani Mheshimiwa Spika.   
 
(Applause)  
 
The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes Hon. Nyiro?  
 
Hon. Nyiro:  Thank you Mr. Speaker for this opportunity to react and also give my 
sentiments concerning this issue that has been raised by the Chairman. Mr. Speaker it is 
worrying that we are no w not talking about opportunities brought about by investors but we 
are talking about our very own opportunities created by this government that we serve, the 
tenders that Hon. Thoya is talking about I think is a tender tha t has been given by the County 
government of Mombasa to a contractor and it is worrying that sometimes we are not even 
aware of the work that are going on in our wards . I think the best thing that should happen 
whenever work commences in our W ards we should be informed so that from time t o time 
we can be able to visit those sites, so that we can bring ownership to these projects and tell 
our people that ....  
 
(Applause)  
 
August  1, 2018                COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                               60

Page 4  ...This is what our County g overnment is doing to our people . Secondly when we 
were campaigning Mr. Speaker it has to b e noted that the biggest pledge and promise that we 
gave to our people which is becoming a lie is that we would fight hard so that we can get 
opportunities for them to get their daily bread.  Now we as the Hon. Members we are 
appearing as liars and also the  government is appearing to lie to its own people because why 
can it create opportunities then deny these villagers the opportunities to get their daily bread ! 
So Mr. Speaker this trend should stop and if there  is anything that is within the powers of this  
House that can be done to this worrying trend because it is a man eat man  situation , we are 
eating our own people, we are taking back the effort to our people and the faith they have for 
us by denying them the opportunity and the ownership .  
 I think for there to be good ownership of these projects the people and the leaders 
must be aware of them so that they can continue to drum and tell th e people that this is what 
the g overnment is doing for us and then because of this our people are getting employed or  
rather are getting the opportunity to serve to get their daily bread . So we are urging all the 
departments that have projects which are undergoing in their villagers to make sure that all 
the Hon. Members of those areas are aware of these projects and sec ondly these Hon. 
Members are given opportunity to make sure that the ir people, villagers are among those who 
are working . We do not say 100 per cent  who are wo rking there should be from the W ard but 
at least as the Constitution says 80  per cent  or 70  per c ent can be better so that we also share 
with the people who need employment . So Mr. Speaker it is a worrying note and something 
must be done otherwise it is a very good insight, observation from the Hon. Chair. Thank you 
Mr. Speaker.  
 
(Applause)  
 
The Deput y Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Hon. Abrari , the Chief Whip is up so let the 
Chief Whip proceed . 
 
The Chief Whip (Hon.  Kitula ): Mheshimiwa Spika mimi nimeweza kusimama 
kwanza kuweza kupinga ile taarifa  ambayo imeweza kuletwa na Mheshimiwa Thoya. Jambo 
la kwanza Mheshimiwa Spika ni kwamba ameweza kusema hawa wanakandarasi  wanapatiwa 
kandarasi  katika eneo lake waweze kupatiwa kipao mbele wale vijana lakini changamoto 
ambayo mimi mwenyewe nimeweza kuishuhudia Mheshimiwa Spika inakuwa vigumu yule 
mwanakandarasi  kuwez a ku supervise  wale vijana kwa sababu wale vijana huwa na kiburi ya 
kwamba wamepatiwa kazi na Mheshimiwa wao , kwa hivyo hawawezi kuchukua mawazo ya 
yule mwanakandarasi . 
 Jambo lengine wale vijana Mheshimiwa Spika huwa wanataka malipo 
wanayopendekeza wao si o mwanakandarasi,  kwa hivyo utenda  kazi kule mashinani unakuwa 
vigumu manake sisi tumempatia yule  mwanakandarasi  muda wa kazi inastahili kumalizwa 
lakini wale vijana wanataka malipo kwao...

The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Hon. Kitula , there is a point of order, what is

Page 7 Kama unavyojua kwanza kabisa tumbo halizai haramu ; kumaanisha hivyo 
Mheshimiwa S pika yule kijana ambae pengine atakuwa ameletwa na makandarasi  na yule 
ambae  anatak ikana atolewe katika W odi sioni tofauti yule ni ki jana na yule mwengine ni 
kijana. La pili Mheshimiwa S pika vijana wetu wengi kazi yao ni kukaa maskani na kazi yao 
ni kukaa kula Mugok aa na vile  vile katika utenda  kazi nakuomba unilinde kwa sa babu nina 
haki ya kuongea kama Mheshimiwa katika hili B unge , maanake nas ikia kuna kelele huku .

ya kwanza kwamba tumbo halizai haramu na bora awe mtoto ni kijana ni mkaazi wa 
Mombasa kwa  nini tubague , kwani yule anatoka wapi na h uyu mwengine anatoka wapi ama

 Mheshimiwa Spika mimi ni mwakilishi wa Kata Ndogo ya Kadzandani ambayo iko 
eneo Bunge la Nyali. Mimi nimeingia katika Bunge hili na tikiti ya ODM na Mbunge wangu 
yuko Independent na kwa hakika Mbu nge yule ana  njia zake ambazo ali fanya kampeni na 
kuahidi wananchi na baa dhi ya wana nchi alio  waahidi ni wale wale wa Kadzandani. Saa hii 
Mheshimiwa Spika kuna ujenzi mara mbili , mara tatu , mara nne ambao unaweza  kuendelea 
katika W odi; aidha kwa wakati mmoja ama kwa nyakati tofau ti tofauti. Kwa mfano hivi sasa 
kuna barabara zinazoitw a za KERA ama za KURA ambazo ziko katika kitengo cha Mbunge ; 
ni kweli kabisa Mheshimiwa Spika kwamba Mbunge yule hakuna siku hata moj a nilisimama 
kwenye juu ya jukw aa nikasema apewe. Lakini alikuja Kadzandani kujiombe a na akaahidi 
vijana mambo yake ; leo hi i nikiona amekuja pale na amechukua vijana wa Wodi ile ile alio  
waahidi kwa nini mimi kama Mwakilishi nisikie uchungu?
