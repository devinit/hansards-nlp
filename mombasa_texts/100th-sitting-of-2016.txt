STATEMENT  
       The Temporary Speaker (Hon. (Mrs.) Serah Nyamvu la): Hon.  Paul Onje . 
       Hon. Onje:  Ahsante sana Bi Spika. Bi  Spika mimi taarifa  yangu ni mambo ya usalama 
kwenye eneo langu kule Wodi ya Junda. Bi Spika tunajua ya kwamba serikali ni kulinda 
wananchi wake na mali yake lakini kule kwangu Wodi ya Junda k una vijana wamejitokeza 
kutatiza shughuli ya wananchi, biashara usalama pale umezorota Bi Spika.  
       Hasa ukiingia eneo la Kadongo steji pale Bi Spika kuna tuta moja kubwa ukielekea huko 
sehemu ya Mishomoroni mkono wa kushoto utaona kuna bomba  kubwa ya  stima na hi lo bomba  
kubwa kuna kibanda chengine hapo pia kikubwa cha mbao ambacho kina mashine ndani yake na 
hilo eneo Bi Spika kuna vijana ambao huwa wanakaa tu kwa jina la kwamba ni manamba 
wanangoja matatu wengine wanakaa hapo hata hujui wanatoka wapi?   
       Kwa hiyo wale ambao wanawaonea sana ni kina mama, mama akipanda kwenye tuktuk 
tayari kipochi kishakatwa na kisu kinaenda ; mara mama anapiga simu, simu ishachukuliwa 
inaenda mpaka kuna juzi Bi Spika kuna mama ametoka Kongowea na ndizi zimeanza kuiv a hizo 
ndizi zilichukuliwa wakakimbia nazo mama akabaki kwenye Tuktuk  akiwa hajui nini cha 
kufanya?  
       Kwa hivyo Bi Spika mimi naomba ikiwa kuna uwezekano wowote vile serikali inaweza 
kufanya ili wale vijana wachukuliwe hatua ningeshukuru ; sababu nyen gine ni kwa mba 
wanafanya kazi yao kuanzia Ijumaa, Jumamosi mpaka J umapili n dio sasa wanamaliza kazi 
kabisa;  kazi wanafanya mpaka saa sita usiku wakukutana na wewe kama wewe kidogo 
unashindana h utaki kitu kidogo wanakukata na panga.

        Kwa hivyo Bi Spika hata mimi baadhi ya vijana wengine niliweza kupeleka baadhi ya 
majina yao nikampelekea OCPD wetu kule  kituo cha polisi cha  Dog Station , majina mengine pia 
nikapeleka Kituo cha stesheni ya Nyali nikampa OCS lakini mpaka saa hii sijaona mabadiliko 
yeyote wanakaa pale lakini polisi wanawaona pale lakini hakuna hatua yeyote wanachukua lakini 
wewe Bi Spika unatoka kwako unaenda kununua mboga unashikwa tu wewe ambaye ni mtu 
ambaye huna hata hatia unashikwa unaambiwa unaranda randa tu mtaani lakini wale ambao 
wanakosesha raha mtaani hawafanywi lolote.  
       Kwa hiyo mimi naomba mimi kama Mwakilishi wa eneo hilo hao vijana wachukuliwe hatua 
manake ni vijana wadogo sana Mheshimiwa Spika hata ukiwaona utashangaa kazi yao ni kuiba 
na wengi wao wana umri mdogo wa m iaka 14, 12, 13 . 
       Kwa hivyo ni watu hata sio vizuri watu wakae wakiangalia wanatatiza amani naomba Bi 
Spika tupatie mwelekeo tuone watu wangu wanakaa na amani na wafanye biashara zao bila 
tatizo. A hsante sana.  
       The Temporary Speaker (Hon. (Mrs .) Serah Nyamvula) : What we will do is to refer this 
statement to the security committee led by Hon.  Ndanda to bring a report because this issue is a 
very urgent issue and I will give it seven  days and the issue is not only in Junda . I think we h ave 
issue of insecurity in the whole of Kisauni and I think it is known but it is the action after this 
issue has come to this House several times.  
STATEMENT  
       Hon.  Mary Akinyi . 
       Hon. (Ms.) Akinyi : Ahsante sana Mheshim iwa Spika.  Mheshimiwa Spika ningepen da kuwa 
taarifa hii iweze kurekebishwa hapa haikuwa manhole  bali ni trench ... 
       The Temporary Speaker (Hon. (Mrs.) Serah Nyamvula) :  The amendment is noted, 
continue.  
       Hon. (Ms.) Akinyi : Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa Spika . Mheshimiwa Spika katika ene o 
Bunge la Airport kuna trench ambayo imechimbwa;  shimo ambalo limechimbwa kama la maji 
September  8, 201 6                    COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                         100 
DISCLAI MER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information

 taka ambayo iko na urefu kidogo na imechimbwa ili kupata mahali pa kupitishia maji na ni 
mahali majumba yako.  
       Majumba yanapakana na hiyo trench  pia ikachimbwa i li yale maji ya mvua yapitie na yawe 
yanaingia katika ile sehemu ya maji taka  ambayo imejengwa pale na katika hiyo shimo ama 
drainage  ambayo imechimbwa mbele ya majumba na haikufin ikwa kumefunikwa tu mahali 
padogo kama daraja ambalo watu wanapitia na katik a pale ambapo kumefunikwa kidogo mahali 
watu wanapitia Bi Spika ni kama ambaye kuna maafa tunangoja kwa sababu iko mlangoni mwa 
pale watu wanapitia na watoto pia wanaishi hapo hapo . 
       Sasa katika hilo shimo watoto wale ambao wanatambaa kuna hatari amb apo wanaweza 
wakatambaa hadi wakai ngia katika lile shimo na hilo shimo ambalo limechimbwa hapo hata 
watoto wanacheza cheza hapo ambapo wanaweza hata kusukumana hata kukiwa kuna mvua 
kubwa wanaweza kusukumana hata mtoto anaweza kuingia ndani akaenda mpaka n a hiyo 
drainage  ambayo inapeleka maji  kwa hivyo mtoto akasukumwa na maji na akapoteza maisha.  
       Kwa hiyo Mheshimiwa Spika ninaomba kuwa Kamati ambayo inahusika ambayo 
imechimba hiyo ninaomba kuwa waende wafunike hapo mahali pote kwa sababu hata hapo hapo 
hilo shimo limechimbwa utapata wakaazi kwa vile liko kilangoni na majumba kadhaa watu 
wamepageuza kama jaa sasa wanatoka na takataka zao pia pale wanatupa tu hapo ndani ya hilo 
shimo ambalo lilikuwa limechimbwa hapo.  
        Kwa hivyo naomba ni jambo  ambalo lina hatari linaweza kutokea wakati wowote kwa 
hivyo naomba Kamati husika ama kitengo husika iweze kuchukulia hilo jambo na uzito ili 
tukaweze kuzuia maafa  isije tukapata maafa ndio sasa tunaanza kusema kuwa kwa nini 
hatukusema? A hsante sana  Bi Spika.
