Page 2 PERMISSION  TO BORROW  FUNDS  EXTERNALLY  TO PROVIDE  FOR  LAND  
SETTLEMENT,  RESETTLEMENT  AND  SQUATTER  SETTLEMENT  WITHIN  
MOMBASA  COUNTY  
The Speaker  (Hon.  Khatri) : I now call upon M ajority leader Khamis Musa M widani 
to give the notice  of M otion.  
Leader of Majority (Hon. Mwidani ): Thank you Mr. Speaker . I rise here on behalf 
of Hon. Hatimy, he has been caught up somewhere with other matters so I will give the 
notice  of M otion on his behalf, Mr. Speaker . 
(Leader of Majority ( Hon.  Mwidani ) moved the notice of Motion ) 
THAT the Government of the County of Mombasa is charged with the responsibility 
of project policy formulation, implementation, administration, operation and 
maintenance under Part two of the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution  of Kenya , 
2010 ; 
AWARE THAT the issue of land tenure in the Coast region has historically been a 
contentious issue and that huge tracts of land are owned by absentee landlords and 
many households in areas such as M ishomoroni, Vikwatani, Mw akirunge and many  
other areas in Mombasa County are living as squatters on the land ; 
FURTHER AWARE THAT this issue hinders sustainable development, since the 
poor are likely to engage in unsustainable resource use practices in an effort to meet 
immediate survival needs ; 
AND FURTHER AWARE THAT this matter can be properly visited and handled 
through the County Project Facilitation Fund to its conclusion ; 
CONCERNED THAT the general populace mostly affected by the land problem are 
those in the lower income bracket with no means  to purchase land at current market 
prices ; 
I therefore urge this Assembly to RESOLVE  that; 
The County Government of Mombasa through the Mombasa County Project 
Facilitation Fund, be allowed to source and borrow externally funds in the sum of 
Kenya Shilling s Four Hundred and Thirty Seven Million (Ksh. 437,000,000/=) only 
in order to enable it purchase such land from its landlords to facilitate squatter 
resettlement . 
Thank you Mr. Speaker . 
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Clerk ? 
PROCEDURAL MOTION  
ALTERATION OF COUN TY ASSEMBLY CALENDAR
