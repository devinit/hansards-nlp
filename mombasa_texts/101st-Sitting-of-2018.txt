Navy so that we can empower our youth s. Mr. Speaker, we have a C ommittee on  disaster but 
again on issues of sea in a situation of  boats and wh en we donâ€™t have the specialt y services that 
can be given to our people that is why we are in sisting we partner with Kenya Navy to train our 
youth s to be ready in case of such scenario s happen ing. Mr. Speaker S ir if such an agreement is 
entered today the be neficiary will be our youths;  those who will be trained and may be in f uture 
they can be rec ruited as m ember s of Kenya Navy so this will either create opportunity for our 
youths , again we will keep them ready for such events when they occur . Mr. Speaker it is high 
time that not only that  we should also consider having  rescue teams in sub - Counti es in  a 
scenario  whereby  we have done with fire department  the same should be applied . We should 
have these  teams ba sed on each station so that it  can assist when need arises Mr. Speaker. Thank 
you Mr. Speaker.  
 
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes Hon.  Faith Mwende.  
 
 Hon. (Ms.)  Mwende:  Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa  Spika. N asimama kuunga mkono hoja 
hii kwa sababu nik iangalia ni kama inanigusa mimi;  Mheshimiwa Spika ni ukweli wakati  
kumekuwa na majanga hatuna watu ambao ni wa  kuja kuokoa jamii , ikiwa ni majan ga ya moto 
au mafuriko na  hii itakuwa ni fursa nzuri ya kuweza kutoa elimu kwa vijana wetu ndio waweze  
kujua watakabiliana vipi na mambo h ayo. Mheshimiwa Spika kulingana  na Mheshimiwa 
mwenzangu alivyosema ingekuwa ni bora zaidi kuwe na vijana katika kila  Wodi kwa sababu 
kama ni mafuriko na kama eneo Bunge l a Changamwe liko na Wodi  tano itakuwa vigumu sana 
hiyo t imu kuenda huku na huku,  lakini kila Wodi  iwe na vijana  wa kujitolea kwa sababu ikiwa ni 
mambo ya hatari haiji kila mara huwa ni  ya msimu na pia K aunti iwaangalie kitu kidogo na pia 
kuwapatia vitu vya  kujikinga.  
 Mheshimiwa Spika nikipeana  mfano  kwangu niko na rescue team  yangu ijapokuwa 
haija patiwa mafunzo  lakini inakuwa ni changamoto  kama ni mafuriko ama ni mambo ya kuzima 
moto kitambo gari ya kuzi ma moto ya K aunti ifike huwa inapata ile nyumba karibu ishaisha . 
Kwa hivyo itakuwa bora kama waheshimiwa wana weza pewa  hio fursa ya kuangalia ni vijana 
wagani ambao wan aweza jitolea kwa sababu wengi huwa wanaenda mafunzo  lakini kujitolea  
kufanya ile kazi  ni ngumu mwanzo wapimwe wajulikane kwa kweli wana weza jitolea hata kama 
wataambiwa malipo baadaye , kwangu niko na wale wanajitolea lakini shida ni vile vifaa hawana 
na mafunzo pia yanakosekana .

DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information

ambazo zimekuja kwa hi li Jumba  hili ni mambo ya mikasa  na ukiona hilo jambo limekuja tena ni 
jambo ambalo linafaa kuchukuliwa hatua ya haraka iwezekanavyo , mafuriko si haba hapa Kaunti 
ya Mombasa ukiangalia mambo ya moto majumba yamejengw a kihole la holela ile gari ya moto 
kufika pale pia huwa ni matata . Hivyo basi  ni jambo ambayo inatakikana i tekelezwe  haraka 
iwezekanavyo . Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa Spika.  
 
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes Hon . Hamida.  
 
 Hon. (Ms.)  Noor:  Thank you Mr. Speaker. I do support the M otion on the disaster 
management because while it rains it normally does happens that we are always having disasters , 
and if the N avy is going to be helping us to train these youths in every sub-County it will be 
preferable so th at at least we are not going to depend so much on the C ounty government to keep 
on coming and helping us whenever we have a disaster or the situation, thank you.  
 
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes Hon . Bernard Ogutu.  
 
 Hon. Ogutu:  Ahsante sana Bwana Spika . Mimi ninaunga mkono hoja hii japokuwa 
ningetamani sana iwe si vijana wa kunitolea  Mheshimiwa Spika ; hawa vi jana wangeangaliwa 
mbinu angaa wafanye kazi kwa bidii ili wapate kitu wapeleke nyumbani ile kazi ni ngumu 
ambayo ikiitwa  ya kujitolea  wanaweza kujitolea  siku mbili ukatoroka. A hsante Mheshimiwa 
Spika.  
 
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Hon. Ramla.   
 
 Hon. (Ms.)  Ramla  Said : Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika . Mimi pia naunga mkono huu 
Mswada kwa sababu ni muhimu sana ; tulipatikana  na kisa kimoja mwaka  jana binam u  wangu 
alipotea kwenye bahari  na vijana wenye ujuzi huo walichukua siku tatu kumtafuta ndugu yetu 
na akapatikana . Kwa hivyo hawa vijana kitu naweza waomba ni kufunzwa zaidi na kupewa kazi 
waweze kudumu kwenye maisha , hivyo basi  naunga mkono huu Mswada up ewe nguvu ahsante.  
 
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Now I call the mover of the Motion to respond . 
 
 Hon. Murfad  Amur : Thank you Mr. Speaker . Mr. Speaker Sir I wish to tell this 
Assembly if these volunteers come out and volunteer and be trained even as an A ssembly as 
Mombasa County we  will think o f them on priority issues when employment issues arise . Mr. 
Speaker Sir  I have seen a window for them to be employed  since  we need them , we are in need 
of them as we ha ve a shortage in fire fighting depa rtment , in the other department in the diving 
rescue team .  Mr. Speaker  we have a rescue team but it  is only having  maybe one person or two 
that cannot help us but I can a ssure the Members if the young men and the young ladies 
volunteer  an opportuni ty will opens doors . I can tell this House they will be the  first people to be 
considered when such opportunities are going to be availed so that the first priority we will give 
them so that in return they can enjoy the fruits of their hardship Mr. Speaker, thank you.  
 
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Thank you Hon . Amur Murfad . Hon. Members I 
now st and to put a question that the Motion on Training of the youths by Kenya Navy on disaster 
preparedness be adopted in this Hono urable H ouse.
