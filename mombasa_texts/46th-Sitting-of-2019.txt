County to make use of this b udget.  
 The Budget that is ending 30th June of this year had so many hiccups, it never fully 
accomplish ed the desire of the people of this County . We still have some other areas of this 
County that are und er developed and I want to urge...,  I want to be on record Mr. Speaker that 
the Executive must take the responsibility of ensuring that all corners of thi s County is developed 
according to the Constitution because the devolution came to do way with issues of 
marginalization as all of us knows. S o we do  not want to see the same scenario that has happened 
for the last one year happening again for the next one  year Mr. Speaker.  
 Otherwise I wish to support. Thank you.

Member for Airport Ward I had an opportunity to interact directly with my electorate through 
public participation. I think that is actually a milestone to the Committee of Finance a nd I would 
like this to continue Mr. Speaker S ir.  
 Number two Mr. Speaker Sir, that now as I recommend personally that this b udget should 
go through now the challenge to the D epartment of that is Executive on how this money is going 
to be utilized to the development in our County. Mr. Speaker Sir it should be well done so that 
our people should benefit from this particular document. Thank you very much.  
 
 The Speaker (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you very much Hon. Ibrahim. Yes Hon. Samba?  
 
 Hon. Samba:  Yes Mr. Spe aker Sir, thank you so much I would also like to at least make 
some input. I would first of all wish to thank the Committee that is responsible for this and my 
attention has been drawn to the recommendations and I would just emphasize to the 
recommendation number one, two, and three.  
 The recommendation (21) That, the County Government should utilize funds for civic 
education to sensitize the public on devolution ; Hon. Speaker when we had a public participation  
we had some hiccups and most members of the pu blic were complaining about civic education 
and somehow they were clueles s so I would wish to thank the C ommittee for at least noting that.  
Number two that the County Executiv e to ensure that County B udget  and Economic F orum is 
establish ed and its functio ning fast tr acked.  
 In implementation we also have issues on matters of implementation where we always have 
good resolutions but when it comes to matters on implementation ...; if they are captured at least 
they sense something , also 23 that is my last poi nt that a  question naire  be designed Hon . Speaker 
and I would just wish that it should not just be in writing but question naire  sheet can be used  also 
to collect some of the views and it is an advanced kind of system so  mine is just to urge the Hon. 
Members  that we in one accord pass and adopt the b udget as it is. Thank you Hon. Speaker.  
 
 The Speaker (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you very much Hon. Samba.  Yes Hon. Charles Kitula, 
Chief W hip? 
 
 The Chief W hip (Hon. Kitula) : Ahsante Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti . Nikiangalia katika 
mapendekezo  Mheshimiwa M wenyekiti tulipokuwa mashinani wananchi waliweza kulalamika 
sana kwamba stakabadhi hizi zinapokwenda mashinani ni zinaenda katika njia ya muundo wa 
lugha ya Kiingereza  ambapo wananchi waliweza kupendekeza kwamba hizi fomu ziw e katika 
lugha ya Kiswahili ikiwa ni lugha ambayo inatumika sana hapa Mjini Mombasa na vile vile 
wananchi waliweza kulalamika sana kwamba sisi kama Serikali ya Kaunti ama Executive  ikienda 
hakuna lolote ambalo wanafanya ili kuwapatia ya kwamba bajeti hii i nazungumzwa kwa muda 
mrefu.  
 Kwa hivyo sisi kama Kamati ya Bunge tungependekeza pia angalau waweze kupikiwa 
chakula wakati wa mikutano hii na kuweza kuwapatia angalau nauli ili kuweza ku wapatia 
motisha wananchi wetu kuja mikutano kama hii. Hivyo basi  ningependa kuhimiza hilo na 
Kamati ya Fedha waweze kulizingatia katika bajeti yao kwenye msimu unaokuja. Ahsante sana.

Mwenyekiti mimi niko ka tika D3018 na kwa maoni yangu k ama Mwakilishi wa Kata ndogo vile 
vile mmoja wa Bunge hili ningesema kwamba sisi  kama Kaunti tumekuwa tukiweza kutegemea 
na donor   funds  Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti . Sasa ingekuwa bora zaidi ikiwa idara pia angalau 
ingeweza kuweka, maana hizi sheria nyingi na mikakati mingi ugatuzi unatumika maswala ya 
maji ni kipao mbele katika serikal i yetu ya Kaunti ya Mombasa .  
 Kwa hivyo Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti  sisi tunategemea  na donor funds  shilingi  1.5 
billion i lakini kama serikali ya Kaunti hatujaweza ku  appropriate kiwango chochote ; kwa hivyo 
hilo lingeweza kuzingatiwa hata kama ni katika  supplementary  ijayo tuweze kuwa wekea pesa 
kwa Kamati ya Idara ya maji Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti. Ahsante sana.  
 
 The Chairperson (Hon. Mwalimu) : Thank you Hon. Charles Kitula . That is a future 
opinion  that we should look upon that Department because there is no written amendment or 
submission that we could proceed to amend whatever the figures that we have because we can as 
per the PFM Act entitled to one percent correction or if we want to omit whatever  is in this 
budget under the PFM Act we are allowed t o proceed .  
 So thanks for whatever that you have raised and I think it will be a future consideration.

(Question proposed ) 
 
 The Chairperson  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes Hon. Members I now propose a question that 
schedule on votes D3011, D3012, D3013, D3014, D3015, D3016 , D3017, D3018, D3019, 
D3020, D3021, D3022, D3023, D3026  be part of the Bill . Yes Hon. Mwamwiri?  
 
 Hon. Athman Mwamwiri:  Ahsante Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti . Mheshimiwa 
Mwenyekiti hoja yangu a ma dukuduku langu ni kwamba hatujafanyiwa haki mahali pamoja 
katika migao iliyowekwa kwa minaajili ya maendeleo . Tulipaswa angaa tuwe na nukuu ama 
makashablasha yenye yana  ashiria  kila kiwango kilichotengwa kwa kila idara kina  kusudia 
kufanya nini  kule tunak otoka lakini kwa hali hii inakuwa ni changamoto hususan sijui wenzangu 
kama wako radhi lakini mimi kwangu itakuwa ni mtihani kufuatilia hizi idara katika kutekeleza 
kwa bajeti yao kule mashinani  ikiwa sina taarifa ni kipi kilichopangi wa kati ka eneo langu na kwa 
idara gani . 
  Kwa hapa hizi za recurrent  sina shida nazo kwa sababu najua ni obvious  ni mishahara na 
matumizi kadha wa kadha lakini kwa haya mwisho wa mwaka ukiisha tutakuja kumuuliza nani 
kama hakuna kinachoashiria kinakusudiwa k ufanywa katika eneo langu.  
 Ahsante Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti kama utakuwa na ufafanuzi wa hilo nitakuwa radhi 
kama hauna binafsi siko radhi.  
 
 The Chairperson  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Thank you Hon. Mwamwiri . Indeed you have valid 
question s but Hon. Mwamwiri when we w ere discussing the re port from the Committee on the 
Program Based Budget that was the ideal time you could have raise d for the Committee to 
submit the reports on the various development that the County has intended to do , but in this 
Appropriation Bill there  is no where that you will find that its written that this certain amount it  
is going to do this certain development.  
 
 Hon. Athman Mwamwiri:  Nalifahamu hilo Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti labda nilipitiliwa 
sikuliuliza panapostahili najua katika Appropriation Bill  hatuwezi k upata hizi Program Based na 
lugha m nayo  itumia katika ripoti na kadhalika ni Program Based. Kwa hivyo kwa chini ya 
Wenyekiti wako nakuomba uitoe ilani ama amri kwa Kamati husika itufanyie mpango ama 
inifanyie mimi mpango binafsi nipate nukuu hiyo niweze kuju a kwangu kuna nini kwa sababu 
kufikia sasa hata hiyo Annual Development Plan  (ADP) mimi kama Mwakilishi wa W odi ya 
Likoni sijaiona na sijui ina nini na hapa lugha inayotumika ni Program Based Budget  na hiyo 
estimate  ya hizo programmes  sijazipata . Kwa hivyo naomba utoe amri kwangu mimi naona hawa 
wenzangu wameridhika niweze kupata hizo niweze kuangalia yale yaliyopangwa katika eneo 
langu. Ahsante.  
 
 The Chairperson  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Hon. Vice Chairman; the Vice Chairman Budget 
and Appropriation you have heard  the concern from Hon. Mwamwiri so it  is up to you to go a nd 
look back at the Program Based Budget and refer to the Annual Development Plan (ADP) that 
have been circulated to the Members .

13  And if the Hon. Member is not answered by the Program Based Budget (PB B) you will 
have to go back to the Executive Committee Member and bring back a valid document and give 
it to Hon. Mwamwiri as he has requested is the one who needs to see that document. Yes?  
 
 The Leader of Majority (Hon. Mwidani) : Mr. Chairman I have noted and I think I will 
follow up on that issue. Thank you.  
(Consultations)  
 
 Mr. Chair I think it is a matter of one week.  
 
 Hon. Thoya:  Thank you very much Mr. Chairman . The  same concern that ha s been 
raised by Hon. Mwamwiri I would be very happy to be included because I would need to know 
what  kind of the programs and where ; therefore please include my name if it  is a matter of names 
I need that document so that I may inform my people of Mikindani that this program is coming 
to Mikindani as far as we are looking at this document generally. Thank you.   
 
 Hon. Bwire:  Thank you Mr. Chair . Mr. Chair every Member wants to know wha t is 
happening to his/her Ward. 
 
(Applause)  
 
 It is only that we cannot raise the same issue at once and as far as am concern ed Hon. 
Mem ber as represented all elected Members…  
 
(Applause)  
 
 We do not want to object to the budget and we would wish to know what  will happen in 
each and every Ward in this 2019/2020 Financial Year so let the Vice Chair Finance when you 
come to respon d kindly make sure all the 30 Wards are factored, all the 30 Wards are mentioned  
on what will happen with this financial year. Thank you Mr. Chairman.  
 
(Applause)  
 
 The Leader of Majority (Hon. Mwidani) : Mr. Chairman I do support and I agree with 
the Membe rs it is very important for the Members to know when and what sort of a project wil l 
be taken to their respective Wards. Thank you Mr. Speaker and I will make sure that we shall get 
those copies so that the Members can know the position. Thank you.  
 
(Applause)  
 
 The Chief Whip  (Hon. Kitula) : Ahsante Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti . Mheshimiwa 
Mwenyekiti sisi jukumu letu kwanza ningependa kuongea kuhusu haya yanayoendelea katika 
D3012 ya Bunge la Kaunti tumeweza kuweka Kshs. 14,056,998 . Ni matu maini yangu kwamba 
Bodi ya Bunge la Kaunti  itaweza kuzingatia Bunge letu maana kelele tunazo sikia si za kisawa 
katika Bunge .

14  Kwa hivyo izingatiwe kwamba lazima Bunge letu liweze kukarabatiwa na liwe ni 
muundo wa kisasa Mheshimiw a Mwenyekiti ; vile vile D3014 bajeti inaundwa na finance , lakini 
pia ningependa kuleta submission  zangu kwamba  inanisikitisha sana kuangalia Kamati hii ama 
idara hii imewekwa Kshs. 409  Millioni  kwa maendeleo  lakini uk iangalia Kamati kama ya 
education  inawekewa Kshs. 120M ilioni . Sasa jambo la kushangaza mbona Idara  hii ya  Fedha  
imewekewa kiwango kikubwa sana kuliko elimu, wakati Idara ya Elimu  iko Kshs.  220M illioni  
lakini  Idara ya Fedha  imepatiwa Kshs.409M ilioni  Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti.  
 Kwa hivyo tuangalie priorities , County priorities  ni nini katika serikali ya Mombasa? 
Lakini leo hii ikiwa kama wao kwa sababu ni jukumu, wana jukumu la kutengeneza bajeti 
wanaiwekea kiwango kikubwa itakuwa hatuendi sawa Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti kabisa .  
 Kwa hivyo leo katika Appropriation  tuko sawa tumeweka Kshs. 409  Milioni  lakini 
Mheshimiwa Mwamwiri amesema tungependa  kujua  hii Kshs.409  Millioni  itafanya maendeleo 
gani, na kama maendeleo yale hayataturidhisha basi Mheshimiwa Mwenyek iti  tutaku wa na 
maswali ya kujibu katika Kamati ya  Fedha . Ahsante sana.  
 
 The Chairperson (Hon. Mwalimu) : Thank you Hon. Charles Kitula . Indeed I also 
concur with you, Hon . Member but the timing of the question Hon. Kitula you could have 
brought the qu estion during Sectoral Committee hearings when the budget was commit ted to the 
sectoral departments . Hon. Members we are guided by our Standing order s and when the 
Committee is submitted to Sectoral Committee that  is when we can peruse the budget and 
whateve r question that you could raise the question during that stage. Yes Hon. Mwamwiri?  
 
 Hon. Athman Mwamwiri:  Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa . Mheshimiwa nukuu yako kuna 
wengine wataiulizia ; mimi narudi kwa D3012 ya kuhusu maendeleo ya Bunge letu ndio 
iliokusudiwa hapa. Mheshi miwa kiutaratibu katika Bunge hili imekuwa tukiendesha shughuli 
tukiwa na wageni ama strangers  katika Bunge amba o ni idara ya wanajiita Hansard . Hansard ki 
kawaida ya Bunge hawapaswi kuwa mahali par wanja kama pale kukaa nasi tukiendesha shughuli 
zetu.  
 Kwa  hivyo tunapozingatia kutengenez we Bunge letu katika hali ya kisasa, hali kadhalika 
watengenezewe pahali mahsusi na kuwa na vifaa vya kisasa ambazo h ata baada ya kikao ndani 
ya mas aa kadhaa tunaweza p ata yaliyojiri katika idara yao . Kwa ilivyo sasa Mheshim iwa 
Mwenyekiti ni masikitiko unaweza enda kule kutaka ripoti ama nukuu dakika fulani na 
ukazungushwa  ndani ya mwezi ama miezi kabla u zipate k wa sababu ya vifaa duni . Hiyo ni 
masikitiko ikiwa ni Bunge 001 tunapaswa kuwa katika hali halisi ama hali ya kisas a, hivyo basi  
tunapokusudia ama tunapoangalia mahitaji ya Bunge hili basi idara ya Hansard  ipatiwe kipao 
mbele na kuweza kuwekwa katika mazingira inavyostahiki na sio kuwa wageni tu kila siku 
katika Bunge hili. Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika.
