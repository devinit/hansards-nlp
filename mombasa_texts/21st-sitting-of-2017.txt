wish to insist or I wish to po int out that the problem of water shortage is not unique to our 
people .  
 It is a very critical problem and needs to be treated with the seriousness it deserves; t he 
people of the entire County of Mombasa are suffering and they are going t hrough  a serious,  
serious water problem.  
 We need to take this matter seriously, this Assembly should regard this matter seriously 
and let us take drastic steps to ens ure that Mombasa receives water, i t is something that has been 
there for quite a long time and people hav e been suffering and we as an Assembly  we are 
charged as representati ves of the people of Mombasa , and seriously we need to take this matter 
with the seriousness it deserves and we need to con cur, to take firm positions to see that water is 
restored in thi s County, otherwise our people will be suffering and it’s an outcry everywhere in 
the County.  
 This, Honourable Speaker when the Committee is going to discuss this matter, they 
should not confine themsel ves to issue of Port Ritz but should take it as a ma tter that is  very dear 
to the entire residen ts of this County, thank you Hon Speaker .

department…. (Inaudible ).  
 Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mswabah Rashid) : Yes Honorable.  
            Hon. Kibwana Swaleh : I think  Hon S peaker, the issue that has been raised by the MCA 
of Port  Ritz is very serious , by being a Member I wouldn’t like...from the C hair…this being an 
election year I think this thing should be taken serious in the H ouse, and to know the modalities 
given rather than being informed by the third party . 
            I think this C ommittee has a duty to get a written statement or report from executive on 
how this bursary will be distributed and at the  same time what is our role as Members of the 
County A ssembly who are repr esenting the people of Mombasa C ounty .

Assembly they don’t understand what is happening up to now, the re are speculations 
everywhere.  
            When you ask everyone has his own personal story about the bursary, bearing in mind 
that last time we are the one s who were distributing these forms , peo ple are anticipating on the 
ground s that we are the one s who are going to distribute these  forms , those are the expectation s 
that the public is having but it is a pity. 
            Mr. Speaker, we as overseers , we as people who represent, leaders who repre sent the 
people  on the ground  today we have no information at all in regards to th e distribution in our 
own wards,  It is a pity and  this is an urgent matter, the C hairman cannot come here and tell us 
that it cannot happen between now and tomorrow ! It can h appen and we are asking and 
requesting Mr. Speaker that by tomorrow we need th is information to come in this H ouse so that 
we can be able to rearrange our program s and know how we are going about these  things 
because the story which is going round is that  the forms will be distributed on Thursday but we 
have no information.

the report by tomorrow. Thank you.
