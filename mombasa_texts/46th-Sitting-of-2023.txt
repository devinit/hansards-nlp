The Speaker (Hon. Khatri ): Thank you Honourable Manuari.  Yes Hon ourable Ibrahim 
Oyugi.  
 
Hon. Omondi: Mr. Speaker , thank you very much fo r this opportunity. Mr. Speaker , 
when we adjourned last tim e I was one of th e Members who emphasiz ed on going through the 
Report which had delayed by that particular time and I reall y stressed that each and every 
Member should read line by l ine so that we understand the P aper well and the report well so that 
when we come back we a re in position to give the right decision . Mr. Speaker , the M otion today 
is about the vetting of Engineer Albert Keino  and it is true that I did a lot of research ; I went 
through the R eport line by line , I read the R eport comprehensively and I understood, t herefore if 
I stand here Mr. Speaker I stand here with a lot of authority to make my point that Mr. Engineer 
Albert Keino  is capable for that p articular position in our good County Mombasa as the chief 
Officer of Transport and I nfrastructure.  
Mr. Speaker , first of all the Committe e that vetted him and also the Report that the 
Comm ittee read is a very competent C ommittee and therefore I do not have any doubt that the 
recommendation that they have made are upto task . Mr. Speaker, number two the competence  of 
Albert Keino  is very competent in this position; personally, I happened to be a Member of this 
Committee of Roads and I nfrastructure in the last regime and indeed Mr. Keino  held the same 
position and he was a very competent Chief O fficer . Mr. Speaker , so I do  not have doubt again if 
he gave him the same position. Mr. Speaker , as my fellow Member of C ounty Assembly has said  
I would like to echo him on the same on the issue of integrity. Engineer Keino , having served in 
the last regime and also this regime I hav e not heard any issue touching him on integrity Mr. 
Speaker and therefore, I recommend him for the position.  
July 25, 202 3                               COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                        46 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified  version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor   Page 8 Mr. Speaker also experience is a very important factor when you are considering 
somebody for a certain position in our country that is one of the b est practice in our country;  and 
it is indeed true as Hon ourable  Manuari has stated that Mr. Keino  has vast experience in the 
same field and he has also been a lot of networking in the same fi eld in our C ounty . Mr. Speaker , 
finally  he is also suitable for t he same position since he has a very good relationship with other 
workers i n the same department and also M embers of the C ounty Assembly. Thank you Mr. 
Speaker , I recommend him.  
 
The Speaker (Hon. Khatri) :  Yes Hon ourable  Hamis i Mbaya from  Timbwani W ard. 
 
Hon. Hamis i Mbaya: Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa Spika kwa kunipatia fursa hii . Kwanza 
kabisa nimshukuru Mwenyezi Mungu, pili niwashukuru W aheshimiwa wenzangu kwa dalili za 
mapenzi ambayo tunaoneshana. Mheshimiwa Spika nimesimama kuunga mkono hoja hii 
ambayo tun amzungumzia ndugu yetu E ngineer Albert Keino  ambaye ameweza kumiminiwa sifa 
tele tele na sif a ambazo ilikuwa zikimwagwa na W aheshimwia wenza zinafanana  ukweli 
kutokana na tabia zake E ngineer Albert Keino . Mheshimiwa Spika , kawaida W aswahili 
wanasema , cha kuj aa hakina lazima ya kuchungulia,  Engineer Albert Keino  yale maneno 
ambayo yamezungumzwa yana  sura ya ukweli kwa sababu hiyo nimesimama kumuunga mkono 
Engineer Albert Keino  kutokana na nafasi ambayo amew eza kupigwa pigwa nao msasa na 
Kamati ya Uchukuzi.  Mhesh imiwa Spika, nimeunga mkono hoja hii kwa asilimia  90 kwa 100. 
Ahsante sana . 
 
The Speaker (Hon. Khatri ): Thank you. Yes Honourable  Makanga , Chaani W ard please 
make your contributions.  
 
Hon. Makanga: Thank you Mr. Speaker . I stand to support the M otion bro ught in this 
House by Hon ourable  Mohammed , Chair T ransport. Mr. Speaker , first I want to congratulate the 
Commi ttee for doing an excellent job;  I think this is the on ly Committee so far that has deliver ed 
within the period that we have been in office. Mr. Speaker Sir , I want to confirm that Hon ourable  
Engineer Albert Keino  is a great leader, he is a team player, he is down to earth and I think he is 
the only person or E ngineer in his department who picks calls from all of us here irrespective of 
time. Mr. Sp eaker, I happened to attend the C ommittee hearings and we could see a man full of 
wisdom not only because of grey hair but from his articulation from how he responded to 
questions and everything about him we can say Hon ourable Speaker that we have the C hief that 
we need for that department.   
Mr. Speaker , without much ado,  I want to take us to paragraph 34 of the R eport which 
states that when he was asked about what plans he has to ensure the stalled   projects under the 
department are completed  within the s tipulated timeline, h e was able to come out clear and say 
that most of these stalled projects have been as a result of being awarded when there are no funds 
and over expectations from the side of the government and the public. I think this is an honest 
opinion that he gave and out of it Hon ourable  Speaker we have seen now that everything that is 
happening every tender that has been awarded in this first year of our administration and we can 
confirm in this House that there is no contractor with a pending bi ll in this period of our 
administration . So this was an honest opinion and we believe as a technical person he is in a 
position to continue advising our able Governor that we may have such a track record of having 
our business people doing business with th e County g overnment and getting back their funds in 
due time so that we can grow our C ounty going forward.

DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified  version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor   Page 9 Further Mr.  Speaker, I want to appreciate E ngineer Keino  who has been the head of this 
department for having come out clearly and strongly to ensure that the  stalled project s in my 
Ward that have stalled for the last seven years being an ECD E I can confirm to you that the 
contractor has now been paid after a period of six years where the leaders who came were not 
able to get this matter addressed . The contractor is now fully paid and he is coming back to the 
site this week and very soon I will call Hon ourable Members here so that we can come and eat 
mbuzi choma  as we celebrate the good doings happening under the stewardship of Engineer 
Albert Keino . Ther efore Mr. Speaker I stand to support with all my body organs. Thank you.  
 
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri ): Thank you. Y es Hon ourable  Pamella, please make your 
contributions.  
 
Hon. Arwa:  Thank you Mr. Speaker for giving me this opportunity also to contri bute. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the A lmighty God for having given us this wonderful moment ; again when 
I go straight to my contribution , last time you gave us a very ample time to go an d scrutinize well 
whether this N ominee is qualified or not and I want to confirm to t his House that the N ominee 
Albert Keino  is a competent person, qualified person because even if you look at the academic 
qualification s, the profession, the guy is right for that position. Again , I want to congratulate the 
Committee of T ransport for doing a  very wonderful job because the Report they gave us and they 
tabled before us is very important R eport and without us wasting mor e time this N ominee is 
qualified for this position and I can confirm with a lot of confidence that he is going to deliver 
becau se in the few days that we have been here we had a slight of interest wanting to know  
whether the guy will deliver or not and even my fellow Hon ourable  Members I think they were 
given some tenders to do some roads on the community based but I think the wo rkâ€¦ 
 
[Loud consultations]  
 
Mr. Speaker , sorry I withdraw that statement, sorry for going out of the point, am very 
sorry for that.  
 
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri ): Yes Hon ourable  Allen Katana, are you on a point of 
information?  
 
Hon. Katana:  I cannot let  this go on record because I think  itâ€™s not in order when the 
Honourable  Member who I respect so much  is saying that the Hon ourable e lected Member s were 
given any work to do . So, I think Mr. Speake r the Hon ourable  Member is not in order by saying 
that. 
 
The Speaker (Hon. Khatri ): Yes Hon ourable  Pamella?  
 
Hon. Arwa:  I am sorry Mr. Speaker Sir . I withdraw the statement.  
 
The Speaker (Hon. Khatri ): Thank you. Continue please.

Hon. Arwa:  I am sorry it is only that I missed the point, they were doing overs ight Mr. 
Speaker, now if I finalize my c ontribution I also support the Motion. Thank you , Mr. Speaker.

Hon. Katana:  Mheshimiwa Spika, kwanza nimshuku ru ni shemeji yangu Mheshimiwa 
Pamela kwa changizo zake za maana na nikiwaacha hawa Waheshimiwa  hawatampongeza lakini 
nataka kumpongeza mimi mwenyewe kwa sababu aliyonena ni ya maana na zaidi ya hizo ya sifa 
zilizotolewa za kumuhusu Engineer Keino  ni nyingi na mimi kwa sababu fulani nisipo simama 
kuunga mkono hoja hii kwa sauti itakuwa naonyesha r oho mbaya sana kwa sababu huyu 
Engineer nataka ijulikane kwamba  anaishi 200 metres kutoka ile State House ya Shanzu . Kwa 
hivyo Mheshimiwa  Spika mbali na h ayo kazi zake Engineer tumezif uata na kwa kuwa hili Bunge 
si Bunge la kupitisha watu tu, twataka tueleze umma na  Kaunti ya  Mombasa kwa jumla iju e ya 
kwamba Ripoti hii iliyopeanwa ni ya kweli kwa sababu kazi zake ni thabiti . Kwa hivyo 
Mheshimi wa Spika sitaki nito e muongozo wa kuzidi uwezo wangu lakini kwa kuwa mimi ni 
jirani ya Engineer  ningekuomba ikiwa itawezekana mjadala ukomee hapo ili tu kaweze kupitisha 
swala hili na Engineer Keino  aendelee kufanya kazi . Nakushukuru Mhesh imiwa Spika kwa 
nafasi hii.

Hon. Mose:  Thank you Mr. Speaker Sir for giving me this op portunity to  contribute to 
the Motion. I  would  like to congratulate our Committee for good job that we d id, most Members 
have said the Report is good. When I go straight to the point, we look ed at the qualification of 
the Engineer, the academic qualification s, employment record, profession association, sui tability 
for the position and we realized he is very suitable for the posi tion so I stand to support the 
Motion.  
 
The Speaker (Hon. Khatri ): Thank you very much, Yes Hon ourable  Prischilla Mumba, 
The former Chair Committee on Transport, please make your contrib utions.  
 
Hon. Mumba:  Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika hasa kwa kukumbu ka kazi yangu kwa Bunge 
lililop ita na kwa kazi ya Kamati hii ya uchukuzi na nimeona ni vyema nichukue fursa hii hata 
mimi kuweza kuunga mkon o hoja hii  nikiwa vile vile ni Mwanakamati k wa sasa wa Kamati hii 
ya Muundo Msingi na vile vile ni kiongeza sauti yangu kama Mwenyekiti aliyeku wa kwa ajili 
nilifanya kazi na Engineer Keino  kwa karibu sana . Kwa hiyo  miaka mitano iliyopita na naju a 
uzoef u wake, naju a ukali wake, naju a urahisi wake, najua mie nendo yake ya kikazi na katika 
Wadi  zetu wakati huo nilipokuwa nikisimama kutetea majukumu yale yaliyokuwa niko na yo 
hakika ni kazi ngumu lakini Engineer ni mtu hachoki kwa wakati wowote unao muhitaji ni mtu 
yuko tayari akisikize, ni mtu yuko tay ari afanye kazi inavyotakikana  kama vile wenzangu 
walivyosema . Kuna kazi nyingi  ambazo yeye amekuwa akisimamia ; kuna zile ambazo zimeisha, 
kuna  zile ambazo bado zinaendelea, kuna zile ambazo tunataka kuanzisha na tuna  imani kuwa 
badala ya kupatia mgeni ambay e hatakuwa anajielewa na hana uzoefu wa kikazi ni heri 
kuendelea na mtu ambae tayari anajua ile kazi na anaju a pahali ambapo ameachia na pahali 
ambapo anaendelea ndio tuweze kuona urahisishaji wa kazi ile kwa mda huu ambao tumepewa 
manake kama sasa hivi t unaju a mwaka mzima umepita, tumebakia miaka kama mitatu ama  
minne ya kufanya zile kazi zetu tuwez e kusimamia, kuona majukumu ya Wadi  zetu 
yametekelezwa . Kwa hi vyo mimi pia ninaongeza sauti yangu kama Mwanakamati kuwa 
Engineer Keino  anatosha kuendelea na k azi. Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika.

Albert Keino  tunaona alianza majukumu yake ya uhandisi mw aka wa elfu moja kenda mia 
them anini na saba, ni wachache miongoni mwetu ambao  tulikuwa tumezaliwa wakati huo ! 
Wengi wa Waheshimiwa walioko hapa Mheshimiwa Spika pia walikuwa ha wajazaliwa na umri 
alio nao katika weledi huu ni sawia na umri wa baadhi ya Waheshimiwa walioka katika hapa ; hii 
inaonyesha ya kwamba hakuna shaka ama shauku katika utenda kazi wake, kwa weledi alio  nao 
katika nafasi hii am bayo Mstahiki Gava na aliyompa na Kamati ikatekeleza jukumu lake kumpiga 
msasa kuweza  kubaini uwezo wake katika hiki . 
 Pili, Mheshimiwa Spika Mwakilishi Albert Keino  yeye mwenyewe katika maswala ya 
kihisani pia tumeona katika Ripoti hii amekuwa akijishughulis ha sana na maswala ya kijamii ;, 
ikiwemo kusaidia baadhi ya watoto wasiojiweza ambao wanatoka familia masikini kuwalipia ada 
ya masomo yao vile vile amekuwa akisaidia baadhi ya watu wasiojiweza kuweza kuhimili na 
kukabili kulipa ada za maswa la  ya matibabu Mheshimiwa Spika na pia kuhusika katika faradhi 
ya maswala ya maziko, iwapo kumetokea dharura ya kijamii ya mtu miongoni mwetu ya mtu 
kupoteza maisha yake. Kwa hayo Mhes himiwa Spika binafsi nipongeze Kamati lakini pia 
niungane nao katika ma pendekezo yao ya kuliomba Bunge hili kuweza kuafiki na kumpa fursa 
muwakilishi huyu nafasi hii ya Afisa Mkuu katika idara ya Uchukuzi na Miundo Msingi,  kuweza

of the Members of the very Committee of Lands, Urban Planning and Housing, and indeed I 
want to affirm to this Honourable House that what the Chair has said is true . We met and went 
through the Report and we actually did the vetting  on the Nominee on the  said date and we 
realised that  the Nominee met almost all the threshhold  and I think he has reasonable minimum 
qualifications  for this particular position Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker , before I actually rally or 
request my fellow Members to support thi s particular Motion briefly I would just like to go 
through some of the points th at made me actually affirm that  the Nominee is capable of the 
position when you read the Report you will find that in academic as a Chair has stated that  he is 
very qualifi ed and he has a Masters of Science  Degree  in Mobile Telecommunication 
Renovation from Strathmore University.  
 Mr. Speaker , also I would like  to inform this House that the Nominee before the House 
also has g ot a vast experience in the  respective field and the best practice I think we can give him 
the job and I know he will be up to the task to that particular job . Mr. Speaker , he has worked in 
both private and public sector s and he has also been a Director of Street Lighting from Jan uary,  
2019 from the same Mombasa Co unty and that means that has built a very good networking with 
the Mombasa County employees and the people who live in this County.  Mr. Speaker , on the 
issue of integrity , the Nominee has never been charged in a court of law and neither has he been 
also ment ioned on any investigative report of the County Assembly or any commission of 
enquiry. I therefore Mr. Speaker recommend and rally this House to support Mr. Ali 
Abdulrahman Shariff to be the Chief Officer of Lands, Urban Planning and Housing in Mombasa 
County. Thank you Mr. Speaker.
