nambari 11 mpaka kufikia n ambari 51. 
       Mheshimiwa  Mwenyekiti  hizi za kazi za kutoa takataka katika Kaunti  kazi nyingi 
hufanywa na vijana na nafikiria ingekua  hatua ya maana kama sisi kama Wajumbe wa 
Nyumba hii tung ewahimiza vijana wajiunge katika vikundi vi dogo vidogo tuwapatie leseni 
ambayo yaweza kuwakimu ili waweze kufanya kazi hiz i. 
       Lakini Mheshimiwa  Spika ikiwa tunaweza kuweka ukusanyaji wa taka taka Kshs. 2.5 
million i kwa mwaka  na vijana ambao tunataka t uwahimize ili waweze kujiunga katika 
vikundi vidogo vidogo ili waweze kufanya hii kazi na ikiwa tunawaekea kiwango ki kubwa 
namna hii itakua naona tunaenda kwa njia ambayo haifai .

Page  9        Kwa sababu tukiangalia kama Kaunti  wanao  jishu ghulisha kabisa katika k ufanya usafi 
mtaani ni vijana wadogo ambao hawana kazi wanajishu ghulisha katika shughuli hizi ili 
waweze kujikimu kimaisha . 
       Hii ni changamoto  kubwa namna hii ni kama kuwatoa katika biashara hii wanayofanya 
alafu kuw aleta wale  wale mabwenyenye wanaof anya biashara waendele e kufanya kazi hii 
kama Keen C leaners . 
       Wale wote ambao walikua wanafan ya kazi hii  Mheshimiwa  nafikiri hapa sisi kama 
Wajumbe  tungefikiria kwamba pesa tunazotoza  tuziweke chini ili tuwape kazi vijana 
wajiunge katika vikundi  ili waweze kuifanya kazi hii na ikiwa tutaweka chini na tukiwapa 
motisha basi nina hakika tutap unguza ukosefu wa kazi...

Page  10        Hon. Faraj:  Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika, nafikiri  tukiongea kuhusu swala ambalo 
kwamba Mheshimiwa  Riziki Fundi anazungumzia tunagonganisha maswala mawili . 
       Kwanza kabisa tunagonganisha vijana ambao wanaokota taka na yale mashirika 
makubwa wanaok usany a taka kutoka kwa hao vija na na sehemu  nyeginezo amba zo kwamba 
mpaka hivi sasa hawajakua  na leseni  na wanafanya biashara na wanakusanya pesa nyingi . 
       Nafikiri Bwana Mwenyekiti  lazima ieleweke wazi ya kuwa vijana wale hawajaathirika 
na hii kabisa, wal e ambao kwamba wana athirika ama wale wale wanaoguswa ni wale ambao 
hivi sasa wa naendelea kufanya hiyo biashara  na Kaunti  ya Mombasa haipati hata shilingi 
moja .
