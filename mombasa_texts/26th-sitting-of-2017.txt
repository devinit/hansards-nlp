Hon. Mohamed Hatimy:  Thank you Mr. Speaker . Mr. Speaker I rise under Standing 
Order 44 . I wish to give a Notice of the following Motion;  
(Hon Hatimy  gave Notice of M otion)  
Mr. Speaker ; 
 THAT AWARE THAT the employment laws and policies require that an officer who 
has serv ed in an acting capacity and has the relevant qualification(s) and/ or experience 
should be confirmed to the substantive position;  
Mr. Speaker ; 
 FURTHER AWARE THAT there are many officers  who are serving in the County 
government and they have the relevant qualifications yet they still serve in acting capacity;  
CONCERNED THAT ; 
 Mr. Speaker this may lead to high turnover and lack of motivation at the place of 
work and hence reduce productivity and encourage vices such as corruption;  
I therefore urge this Hous e to RESOLVE that;  
1. The County Secretary and the County Assembly Clerk to liaise with the County 
Public Service Board and the County Assembly Service Board respectively to have acting 
officers who are qualified and posses s the required technical skills t o be confirmed in 
substantive  positions.

qualified staff.
