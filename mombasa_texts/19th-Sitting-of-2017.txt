NOTICE OF MOTION  
Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Hon. Hatimy . 
Hon. Mohamed Hatimy:  Thank you Mr. Speaker . 
(Hon. Mohamed Hatimy moved the Notice of Motion)  
ENFORCEMENT OF 30% RULE ON EMPLOYMENT WITHIN THE COUNTY  
THAT AWARE THAT Mombasa being a city and economic hub attracts investors 
both locally and internationally;  
FURTHER AWARE  THAT industries and businesses within the County are a source 
of employment and thus can improve the livelihood of the residents of Mombasa;  
CONCERNED THAT businesses within the County do not necessarily employ local 
residents of Mombasa  especially the yo uth and hence they continue languishing in poverty as 
labour is 'imported'  from other Counties;  
I therefore urge this Assembly to RESOLVE  that: 
1. 70% of the persons employed in businesses operating in Mombasa be residents;  
2. Business license not to be is sued or renewed if the 30% rule of employment is not 
adhered to.  
I beg to move  Mr. Speaker . Thank you.   
Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you Hon. Hatimy . Yes Clerk?
