Page 2 Mr. Speaker S ir I beg to give the following Motion;  
 
THAT AWARE  that Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by 
impairments in social reciprocity and communication and the presence of restricted or 
repetitive activities;  
 
FURTHER AWARE  that ASD affects 800,000 people in Kenya today based on WHO 
estimates;  
 
NOTING THAT  today many schools and special units in the County combine all 
children with disability into one group irrespective of the fact that different disabilities 
require different programs and ways of handling the individual;  
 
CONCERNED THAT  there  is lack of equipped schools and trained teachers to attend 
to children with Autism who may benefit from such schools in the County;  
 
I therefore urge this Ass embly resolves that the County government;  
 
1. The Department of Health Services ensure : 
 
A) Proper knowledge, awareness, analysis and actions are in place , 
B) Proper regulations are in place to tackle ASD.  
 
2. Support children with ASD in terms of Education, rehabilitation and 
empowerment of qualified personnel and special schools for them .  
Thank you.
