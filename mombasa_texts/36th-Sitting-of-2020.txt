ikuwe tabled  31st  na kama yuko  nayo pale ina ugumu gani yeye kuileta hapa tungeweza kupata

The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Fadhili Mwalimu) : Hon. Kitula I think in my 
commu nication, I communicated in this Hon ourable House  that we have received the same 
document to my office, the office of the Sp eaker and I have committed the Reports to the 
Committee, so as the Hon. Member is asking for some few days and he has promised that by 
Tuesday you  will have that document, so let us give the Hon. Member until Tuesday next week, 
so that he delivers the document to you.  
 
Hon. Kitula:  Ahsante  Mheshimiwa  Spika , naheshimu maamuzi yako  lakini ni  kama 
nadanganywa wakati tunaenda mapumzikoni k ulingana na kalenda yetu k wa hivyo tayari 
tumekiuka sh eria, lakini ukiniambia  kufikia Jumanne  utakuwa umenidanganya kwa sababu 
itakuwa hatuko Bunge, kulingana na kalenda yetu.  
 
The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Fadhili Mwalimu) : Hon. Kitula the Assembly going to 
recess does not mean that the Assembly is not working or the C ommittees are not going to meet, 
so just wait for next week Tuesday;  if he does not present to you the document, so it  is when we 
come back to this Hon ourable  House then you will have a say in thi s Honourable  House, that the 
Committee went against the directive of the Speaker.  
 
Hon. Kitula:  Mheshimiwa  Spika nashukuru kwa maamuzi yako  lakini stakabadhi  hii 
sistahili kuwa nayo mimi kama Kitula , ni stakabadhi  ya Bunge  inastahili kuwa tabled  katika 
Nyumba na deadline  ishapita . Kwa hivyo sijajua kitu gani kinamfanya yeye ashi ndwe ku ileta 
stakabadhi hii  kwa Nyumba? Kwa sababu  rasmi  inastahili ku letwa hapa Bunge. .. 
 
[Interruption ] 
 
The Deputy  Speaker  (Hon. Fadhili Mwalimu) : Hon. Kitula it is simple and the  Hon. 
Members we committed  the documents to that Committee today, so it i s not possible for them to 
table the same document before the C ommittee sits, peruse s and bring s back a Report, they have 
to bring a R eport concerning what it entails in that document .  
So now that we committed the document today let us give them time and they present the 
document be it after we come back  or after recess . In fact we have not reach ed the issue of 
recess, maybe also the Leader of Majority might change his mind and we mig ht continue . 
 
Hon. Kitula: Ahsante  Mheshimiwa  Mwenyekiti naf ikiri kuna j ambo moja ambalo 
hatukuelewana kwa sababu ni jambo rahisi kwamba kisheria haistahili stakabadhi  hii y a Ripoti  
kuletwa katika Nyumba alafu ikakuwa committed katika Kamati tena, hakuna s heria 
Mheshimiwa  Mwenyekiti , naomba Makatibu wa Bunge  waku elekeze chini ya Section 166 of 
PFM.

sheria baadaye iwe committed to sectrol C ommittee . Mheshimiwa Mwenyekit i, hapo tu ndio 
naomba unipatie mwelekeo wako.  
 
The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Fadhili Mwalimu) : Yes Hon. Tobias Samba.  
 
Hon. Samba:  Hon. Speaker it seems my friend  and Honourable c olleague is learning too 
fast and so much Hon. Kitula ; through  the Chair  there is  nothing the House or we as Members 
can do after a Member has requested that he can issue the S tatement by Tuesday and Hon. 
Speaker has also made a ruling. The only thing  we should  be now talking about maybe we are 
going for recess maybe he was not aware t hat we are going for recess, he can request for another 
time. But Hon. Kitula my friend I do  not know whether you want the Hon. Speaker to direct then 
the Chairman to go out and come with the document immediately, I do  not know but to save time 
and it has happened because you a re in agreement that the first q uarterly Report you have and the 
second one he has  not produced. Maybe this is the time and things are now changing, how we are 
doing things, things are now changing b ecause initially most of us were ne w even with the 
procedures,  with the rules and regulations  we are now catching up. So we acknowledge that 
maybe there are some hiccups somewhere but I do  not know whether you want Hon. Speaker to 
subject the Hon. Member to go outside and come with a docume nt and the best thing the 
Chairman has done for the Finance  he has requested for more time. So I think it is prudent or fair 
enough if we give him that time so that at least next time you be served or given the document 
that you have requested for. Thank y ou Hon. Speaker.  
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon.  Fadhili Mwalimu) : Thank you Hon. Tobias Samba. Hon. 
Members Committees  are extensions of the Assembly, s o I have directed the Committee to first 
make sure that document that Hon. Kitula is asking for â€¦ I saw it is just a one-page  document as 
said by the Chair by Tuesday give that document to the said Member and any other Member who 
will wish to have that document and  as per R eports that we have committed to that Committee 
the House Business will sit and see as to wh en they will be back in this Honourble  House for the 
Members to discuss on them. Yes, Clerk?  
RESPONSE TO STATEMEN T BY CHAIRPERSON COM MITTEE ON FINANCE HO N. MOHAMED HATIMY ON  
MOMBASA COUNTY BUDGET  EXPENDITURE IN FY 2017/2018  AND 2018/2019  AS SHOWN IN REPOR T 
OF THE CONTROLLER OF  BUDGET  
 Yes Hon. Mohamed Hatimy, Chairperson Committee on Finance, Budget and 
Appropriations?  
 Hon. Mohamed Hatimy:  Mr. Speaker and  Hon. Members I wish to give a S tatement in 
response to issues raised by Hon. Kitula in this House on 11th March , 2020 as follows ;  
Mombasa County Finance Bill , 2019 was submitted for public participation first by the County 
Executive at the Tononoka Hall and by the County Assembly by 31st October , 2019 at various 
locations, the six Sub Counties in Mombasa . 
 The Report on the views collected at the Tononoka public participation forum was 
submitted to the County Assembly and is available on request. The Report by the Sectoral 
Committee on Finance, Budget and Appropriations on the public participation was ado pted by 
the County Assembly at its 118th Sitting on 4th December , 2019.  
August 26, 2020                   COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                                36 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of  the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor   Page 7 Please refer to the Hansard Report available online at the County Assembly website. 
Article 10 and 196 provide a legal framework for public participation which are reinforced by 
the s tatute which as part 8 of the County Government Act of Section 132 and 133 of the Public 
Finance Management Act , 2012. Cou nty P ublic Participation guidelines , 2016 and Standing 
Order No.121 have stipulated that whatever views given in public participation forum must be 
included in the Bill for Finance for other legislation. What is required is for the views to be taken 
into account when preparing or enacting legislation  and that was done parallel to  other 
consideration.  It should be noted that it is not onl y views of the public that should be considered  
but also the need to fund the annual b udget and raise revenue to provide citizens to the wider 
public that is also taken into consideration h ence a balance must be strived.  
 Mr. Speaker the County Assembly R eport on public participation contains satisfactory 
details on the venues, views and details of reduction and increment made on the Mombasa 
Finance Bill , 2019. Either on the recommendations from the public or Committee which were  
adopted by the County Asse mbly  and inc luded in the Bill was enacted ass ented by His 
Excellency the Governor and is now a law. Mr. Speaker indeed the Mombasa County 
Government has recently won a High Court Petition challenging the said law on the basis that 
there was a no public par ticipation ; it also won against an Order for temporary suspension of the 
Mombasa County Finance Act , 2019 by Hotel industry players.  
Mr. Speaker with regard to the other part of the request for state ment on Development 
Expenditure  and other accompanying d etails for the FY 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 these are 
availa ble in  the Controller of Annual Budget Implementation Report and the Auditor Generalâ€™s 
Report which are available freely online. The Member may also get hard copies from the Clerks 
Office. For the F Y 2017/2018 the County spent Ks.2.91Billion in development e xpenditure 
which was 76  per cent of the a nnual allocation  of Ks.3.8Billion. The table 3. 8; on page 90 of the 
Controller of Budget , with Annual Budget Implementation Report for FY 20 17/2018 , provid e an 
analysis of d evelop ment p rojects with the highest e xpenditure.  
For the FY 2018/2019 the Coun ty spent Ks.3.11Billion in the d evelo pment e xpenditure 
which was 71.5  per cent  of the Annual allocation of Ks.4.34Billion. Table 3.81 on page 185 of 
the Contr oller of Budget and Annual Implementation Report for FY 2018/201 9 provides the 
analysis of the development p rojects with the highest expenditure. Mr. Speaker, we wish it to be 
noted that since the Controller of Bu dget and the Auditor General have already r eported on these 
expenditure and Assembly adopted County Public Investment and Accounts Report on the 
Expenditure for FY 2017/2018 this matter stands closed.  Thank you , Mr. Speaker.  
[Applause]  
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Fadhili Mwalimu) : Thank you Hon. Moha med Hatimy. Yes 
Hon. Charles Kitula?  
 Hon. Kitula:  Mheshimiwa Spika nimemsikiliza tena sana vizuri tena kwa makini 
Mheshimiwa Mohamed Hatimy ana yewakilisha Kamati ya Fedha na kusema kweli sijaridhishwa 
asilimia 100 na zaidi majibu al iotowa, k wa sababu taar ifa yangu iko wazi, lakini yeye anafahamu 
kweli kitu gani kinaulizwa. Taarifa iko wazi, Mombasa County Budget Expenditure FY 
2017/2018, 2018/2019 as shown in the Rep ort of the Controller of Budget;  nafahamu niko na 
Control ler of Budget Report nimeipitia, expenditures  za kiwango  ziko ha po, kitu ilikuwa nasema 
nataka expenditures kama Wizara  yake anayo ongoza Finance and Economic Planning imetumia 
Ksh.5Billion.  
August 26, 2020                   COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                                36 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of  the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor   Page 8 Ningetaka kujua hiyo Ks h.5Billion i imetumia nini na nini na nini; n a juzi wakati unatoa 
uamuzi  Kiti chako  ilikuwa wazi h apa nilisimama nikasema nataka matumizi  ili iweze kuingia 
kwenye Hansard, sasa leo hii ananiletea ile ile Ripoti ya Controller of Budget yeye anakuja 
ananiletea  Ripoti ile ile . Ilikuwa wazi Mheshimiwa Mwen yekiti kwa sababu hapa sisi n i 
Wawaki lishi wa kata ndogo mbali mbali;  Transport and Infrastructure imetumia Ks hh.3.7Billion i 
lakini sijui Ksh .3.7Billion i hii imetumika kufanya nini? Na ni jukumu langu kama Mwakilishi 
wa Kata ndogo ya Frere Town kuuliza Kamati yake iweze kuniletea yale matumizi  amba yo 
wametumia Ks h.3.7Billion i niweze kujua zimetumika na hii na hii na hii! Na Taarifa  yangu iko 
wazi Mheshimiwa Spika, ki  wazi sasa vile majibu anavyoto a, anavyosema hapa inaonyesha 
kuwa  Controller of Budget ndio hizi amounts ziko hapa. Halaf u yeye pia analeta ile ile; s asa nani 
atakae jua kama sitauuliza Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti, k wa hivyo naona kwamba haki yangu 
inakiukwa na Taarifa  inavyo jibiwa, haikujibiwa ipasavyo  na Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti  nasubiri 
muongozo wako kulingana na hili kwa  sababu Taarifa  haijajibiwa vile nimeuliza. Ahsante.  
 
The D eputy Speaker (Hon. Fadhili Mwalimu) : Yes Hon. Amriya?  
 
Hon. Amriya Juma:  Thank you Mr. Speaker for according me the opportunity. Mr. 
Speaker i think the request is very clear and the Chairman of F inance ha s given the budget  
expenditure according to the Controller of B udget but you see what Mr. Kitula is saying, is 
asking about a breakdown so when you are talking about budget expenditure and breakdown 
those are two different things. Mr. Speaker we should  not be prone to just appear controversial in 
matters that are very clear on the face value ; If you look at, if you  have read the request for  
Statement of Mr. Kitula he talked about the b udget expenditure and what the Chairman for 
Finance has given is the exp enditure according to the Financial yearâ€™s 2017/2018, 2018/2019 Mr. 
Speaker and so we should  not be fond of just appearing controversial while you  have just ask ed 
for one thing and given the answer and then divert to something else . If the intention was a 
breakdown it should have stated clearly that the intention was a breakdown and if it was 
expenditure the n it should be expenditure as  the Chairman has responded Hon. Speaker.  
 
The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Fadhili Mwalimu) : Hon. Kitula as per your written 
Statement was it on break down or expenditure?  
 
Hon. Kitula:  Mheshimiwa Spika kulingana na Makatibu wanafahamu hapa imeandikwa 
headline  tu ya Taarifa  yangu lakini Taarifa  yenyewe ilikuwa wazi , nilihitaji location of project s, 
amount incurred on each project  na vile vile amount incurred on each development project , 
location of each development project  niliuliza vizuri katika Taarifa  lakini hii hapa Makarani  
kulingana na wao wanaandika tu headlines hata ukiangalia Ripoti  ya Mheshimiwa Kalume ni 
approval list , mamb o ya autism haijaandikwa  Ripoti  nzima imeandikwa tu headline . Kwa hiyo  
hiyo ni headline  lakini content of my  Statement  ilikuwa iko  wazi kabisa nilitaka allocation of 
each and every project  na amount incurred  kabisa.  
 
The D eputy Speaker (Hon. Fadhili Mwalim u): Yes Hon. Tobias?  
 
Hon. Samba:  Mr. Speak er it is quite interesting and i t is good we are advancing, I do not 
think whether what Hon. Kitula is requesti ng can be available even if  Hon. Chair decides  to 
come with the document you will not be able to go th rough them right away because he is 
requesting for the report for the  [Inaudible] .  
August 26, 2020                   COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                                36 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of  the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor   Page 9 In fact I do not know  how to put it but whatever H on. Kitula is requesting may be if we 
can go as per the department because each and every department has got i ts own budge t and 
whatever the C hairman has given that is w hat is supposed to give us and Controller of B udget 
report also has it there . Now if he needs  the detail ed report as per what he is requesting , I think 
we should do it as per department and number two also whe n you want to know the expenditure 
incurred as per each and every project that one I think it requires not even one  Committee as 
Finance but even I mplementation will also be involved . So I think what Hon. Kitula whatever is 
requesting may be if we can have  a bulk document I think that is what is requesting as at now. 
Thank you Hon. Speaker.  
 
The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Fadhili Mwalimu ): Yes Honourable,  let Hon. Mwamwiri 
then Hon. Kitula.  
 
Hon. Ath mani Mwamwiri:  Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika. Mheshimiwa  Spika  swali la 
Mheshimiwa Wa FrÃ¨re T own ni swali bayana  ila katika kulijibu kwake linahitaji ufasaha na 
maelekezi barabara . Kwa sababu Mheshimiwa Spika swala hili likienda kwa Kamati ya F edha 
kikubwa  chao katika kujibu watachukua Ripoti ya Controller of Budget ambayo Controller of 
Budget source ya taarifa yake ina toka kwa Treasury . Hakuna tofauti ya taarifa ya T reasury hapa 
kwetu na Controller of B udget kwa  sababu Controller of B udget anatumiwa taarifa kutoka kwa 
hazina yetu, kutokana na taarifa ile ndio anatengeneza Ripoti hii inayotoka kwa muda lakini  
kiufasaha niungame na M heshimiwa Samba alivyosema moja;  ya kwamba  kila idara  ihusishwe 
katika kuitengeneza R ipoti mahsusi ya matumizi ya fedha zao, pili Mheshimiwa iende ama 
ingekuwa swali amelileta kutaka kujua mgao u liokusudiwa katika Wodi yake na yale yalifanyika 
kama njia moja wapo ya ku oversi ght katika ile Wo di mahsusi lakini inapokuja katika utumizi 
generally  ya mabilioni ya pesa tunazozipata kila mwaka Mheshimiwa  Spika  kwa taarifa kupitia 
kwa K amati moja itahit aji K amati hii tuipe mda wa zaidi ya mwaka kwenda fanya hilo . Lakini , 
Mheshimiwa Spika aid ha kwa marekebisho  yake binafsi ama kwa maelekezo yako swala hili 
lirudi kwenye Kamati mahsusi, kila Kamati kuchukua jukumu la matumizi ya bajeti ya K amati, 
alafu taarifa zile zije kutokana na kila idara pengine ingemridhisha kidogo katika yale 
aliyoyakusudia kuyap ata kuliko kulitar ajia hili moja kwa moja kutoka kwa K amati ya Fedha  
itakuwa na mushkil na mtihani. Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika.  
 
The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Fadhi li Mwalimu) : Yes Hon. Kitula?  
 
Hon. Kitula:  Mheshimiwa Spika nimemsikiza Mheshimiwa Samba na Mheshimiwa 
Mwamwiri lakini niwaambie kwamba Kanuni za Bunge nambari  41 iko wazi kabisa, kila mmoja 
ana haki ya kuuliza Taarifa jinsi anavyo taka, mimi nimeuliza Taarifa yangu ninavyotaka mimi na 
nina haki kuweza k ujibiwa ninavyotaka mimi na  Taarifa  yangu iliweza kuwa wazi â€¦ 
 
[Interruption ] 
 
Tafadhali naomba hapa ni Bunge ukiwa una  jambo  kupitia K iti chako simama utaje 
Kanuni ya Bunge  au kama nakosea nitakusikiza kulik o kuguna . Kwa hivyo  Mheshimiwa S pika  
mimi niko na haki ninaposimama kuuliza  Taarifa  na Taarifa  yangu iko wazi na nimesema hata  
tukafanya nini stakabadhi  zote na malipo yote inafanywa na Wizara ya Fedha , bado Fedha  ndio 
wako na file zote za IFMIS, file zote za softcopy  na hardcopy wao ndio wako  nazo pale  na ni 
jukumu lao wao kuweza kunipatia mimi .  
August 26, 2020                   COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                                36 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of  the Official Hansard Report is for information

file tu wako nayo , kama Wizara  ya Mazingira  watasema, environment file  ya Environment 
department  yake ni hii hapa 2017/2018 development ni hizi, waje wanipatie hizo stakabadhi  
niweze kuzipitia ziweze kuonekana . Na ni kitu kidogo tu lakini sasa mtu kujanipatia matumizi  
amba yo yako hapa, Mwamwiri ameeleza vizuri Controller of B udget source  yake inatoka County 
Treasu ry lakini hakuna hapa sote ni Mheshimiwa Mwamwiri na Samba ni elected , leo 
nikimwambia Mheshimiwa Samba ambaye ni Mwenyekiti wa Kamati ya Vijana, Jinsia na 
Michezo Wizara  ya YGS imetumika kwa development imetumika shs190Milioni  aniambie 
imefanya nini atashindwa kunijibu na kama atakuwa anajua basi mimi nimefanya makosa . 
Lakini mimi ni Mwanakamati wa Kamati hio lakini hatuju i Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti pesa 
zinatumika lakini hatuwezi kuelezea wananchi katika  shs 190 Million i ya development 
tumefanya hiki na hili na hiyo . Ndio mimi nahitaji Mheshimiwa Spika ambapo nashangaa 
Waheshimiwa wenzangu ambao wamechaguliwa kwa kura wan astahili kuni unga mkono kwa hili 
kuweza kuju a sehemu wanayotoka na watu wanao waw akilisha pesa zinazotumi ka vipi  katika 
idara zao zinatumika vipi lakini Mheshimiwa Mwen yekiti kusema ukweli nasubiri mwelekeo 
wako kwa sababu Taarifa  yangu iko wazi kwamba ningependa kuju a zile expenditure list of 
development project , location  na amount incurred . 
 
The Deputy Spea ker (Hon. Fadhili Mwalimu) : Yes Hon. Ath man Shebe?  
 
Hon. Ath man  Shebe:  Ahsante sana  Mwenyekiti kwa kunipatia fursa.  Mwenyekiti 
nimekuwa makini sana nikisoma mvuto ama kuwasiliana kwa mwi li katika Waheshimiwa wote 
hapa; W azungu wamesema body language  na ni masikitiko makubwa nafikiri Waheshimiwa 
wote  wamemu elewa n a Mheshimiwa pia Mwenyekiti wa Kamati ya F edha ameelewa bayana 
Mheshimiwa Kitula malengo ya  Taarifa hii ilikuwa ni nini na ndipo hapa nikasema ik o hatari 
kubwa Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti na mimi pia vile  vile nafunga jamvi kwako Mheshimiwa  
Mwenyekiti  kwa sababu tutahitaji muongozo wako na upeo wako na utumie nafasi ya hicho Kiti 
kuhakikisha kuwa ili W aheshimiwa  na wananchi waweze  kupata baadhi ya maji bu ya matumizi 
ya fedha zinavyotu mika za serikali ya Kaunti basi Mheshimiwa inabidi uweze  kuchukua fursa 
kuhakikisha kuwa swali la yule mlengwa aliyeuliza lijibiwe vile inavyotakikana . Hii ni k wa 
sababu bajeti ya Kaunti ya Mombasa  kila mtu anaju a, bajeti ya Kaunti  huwa inakuja kimpigo, 
inakuja  kifumbo , kwa hivyo fumbo hufumbiwa mjinga tu  Mheshimiwa M wenyekiti lakini  
mwerevu atalivumbua .  
Kwa hivyo K iti chako Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti kimejaa hekima kubwa sana, kubwa 
tunakuomba uweze kutufumbulia hili fumbo ili uweze  kumpatia Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti wa 
Sarafu maeleke zo ya vipi Mheshimiwa mlengwa alivyo uliza hili swali atapata haya majibu kwa  
sababu pia mimi ni mmoja wapo ambaye niko na kiu ya kutaka  kujua matumizi vipi ya pesa za 
maendeleo zilivyotumika kwa kila eneo kata Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti. A hsante.

Hon. Kitula:  Mheshimiwa Spika kwa sababu hizo amount ziko hapo wao kama 
Wanakamati na viongozi katika hizo idara hawawezi kuele za jinsi walivyotumia pesa hizo. H uo 
ni ushahidi wa kutosha kwamba pesa hizo ziliweza kutumika kama kweli ni uongo wao waweze 
kunieleza vile pesa ziliweza kutumika hazijatumika kama kifisadi wanieleze katika Bunge hili

The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Fadhili Mwalimu) : Yes Hon. Amriya?  
 
Hon. Amriya Jum a: Mr. Speaker I think when you look at our Evidence Act , when you 
look at S ection 114 it talks a bout one who alleges must prove . Mr. Speaker , Hon. Kitula has 
come out very firmly in op en Assembly to mention names adversely and these are names of 
persons w ho have reputa tion in the society, this is a P arliament of rules that is guided by rules 
and procedures . 
August 26, 2020                   COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                                36 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of  the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 16  Mr. Speaker if the Hon. Member has mention ed Mr. Hatimy, Ms. Mariam, Ms. Aisha I 
was expecting that he was going to dish ou t documents to prove that t here i s a signature of one 
Mr. Hatimy or Ms. Mariam in misappropriation or will bring out facts in evidence just the same 
way you do it in court . Mr. Speaker i f you look at the Constitution th is Parliament and its 
Committees ha s been given the same jurisdi ction as the High Court and y ou can not tolerate such 
precedence  where Members have started defaming each other  and other Members of the society . 
So Mr. Speaker I urge you before you make a ruling that you be guided by the Constitution, that 
you b e guided b y the Evidence Act and lastly you be guided by th ese Standing Orders and af firm 
your Chair. Thank you.  
 
[Applause]  
 
The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Fadhili Mwalimu) :  Hon. Ibrahim?  
 
Hon. Omondi:  Mr. Speaker just as I said that one Hon. Kitula is behaving more of an 
investigator because he cannot just stand up here in  this Honourable  House and allege  the three 
who are mentioned have been found guilty of what is alleging . Mr. Speaker when you look at the 
three that he is mentioning these are human beings, these a re people who have got families , these 
are people who have got very good reputation in their work and Mr. Kitula  can just stand up and 
mention as if is in his own house and allege that the three have actually mishandled funds for the 
County . 
Mr. Speaker I thi nk this is a very serious offence according to me and again it will be 
very wrong when we come into this House that we should always entertain Mr. Kitula every now 
and then in this House ; in fact he should not be trying to underrate your seat , let me tell you for 
free every time  Mr. Kitula is underrating your seat because you see here every time  he want s to 
argue with you it becomes an argument but here we already have the Order Paper which we are 
supposed to  follow not bring issues . Thank you.  
 
The Deputy  Speaker (Hon. Fadhili Mwalimu) :  Hon. Members I can see we have dwel t 
well o n this issue and there are Standing Orders that have been mention ed, 104  Standing Order 
and others . Standing Orders have been mentioned ; the Hon. Member Hon.  Kitula also provided  
some documents before this Honourable  House. I now take this opportunity to rule that the 
Member will be called before the Powers and Privileges Committee to substantiate his arguments 
and th e Committee will give its stand. T he said Member and the Committe e will look up either to 
call the mention ed people also to come before that Committee , so Hon. Kitula you will be 
notified when to come before that Committee to substantiate on whatever allegations but Hon. 
Kitula if you fail to substantiate and the Commit tee will take its stand . 
 
Hon. Kitula:  Most obliged Hon. Speaker . 
 
The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Fadhili Mwalimu) :  Yes Clerk?
