time there are Members who are coming as far as from Mwakirunge, others also have to cross 
the Likoni Channel every day  and others they do  not even come completely and this is the right 
time for us also to have time with our con stituent s directly and like some of us we are going to 
have good times with those whom we love because even when we have been given a break for 
one week  we have been given time to even make our minds , relax and duri ng some past sittings 
my colleagues  when we were doing the debate here when it came to issue of stress, frustrations 
and depressions this is the only time we going to relax our mind and we are going to come back 
when we are full of energy when our brains are fresh and when we are fully refresh ed.

 Ahsante sana Mhe. Mwenyekiti kwa  kunipatia fursa hii ya kuweza kuchangia. Bila 
kupoteza waka ti ningependa kuunga mkono hoja  ambayo imeletwa na Kiongozi wa Wengi 
katika Bunge hili letu la Mombasa. Nikitangulia kusema kuwa kila kitu huwa kinahitaji 
mapumziko Mhe. Spika  kwa sababu kufanya k azi kwa Bung e hasa kwa mda mrefu  na akili 
inachoka na watu wetu pia wanatuhitaji kule mashinani, familia zetu pia wanatuhi taji.  
 Kwa hivyo naunga mkono hoja hii il iyoletwa na Kiongozi wa Wengi; ha ta mimi pia Mhe. 
Mwenyekiti nilikuwa nimetatizika, nimetati zika mithili ya kuchakurwa kwa sababu mashinani 
nimeanda a mipangilio kabambe ya kuhakikisha kuwa Jomvu Kuu... Nafikiri Mheshimiwa 
kumbukumbu ya Bunge hii itaweza kumbuka kauli yangu  niliposema kuwa usihofu Mungu 
akikufungia mlango mmoja, Mungu huyo huyo ana kufungulia mlango mwingine.  
 Hivyo basi  nafikiri ni wasaa mwafaka wa kuhakikisha kwamba Waheshimiwa Wenza 
hata kama hali hali ya jamvi ya mkeka n afuu nzuri ya kuingia mashinani  kuhakikisha kwamba 
watu wetu wanatuona na tunaweza kuwasaidia pale mahali pana stahiki . Hii ni  kwa sababu mda 
wangu ilikuwa nashindwa Mheshimiwa  nitagawanya mda gani  kwa sababu mipangilio na ratiba 
nafikiri na angalia orodha yangu mia ni kidogo.  
 Kwa hivyo nashukuru kwa saa hii nitapata wasaa mzuri  wa kuhakikisha kuwa Jomvu 
Kuu Mhes himiwa na wewe jirani yan gu ndugu yangu  tutakuwa pamoja kati ka mikakati ya 
kuhakikisha kuwa  ndugu zetu tunawatembelea na wanapata natija . Ahsante sana Mhe.

iliyoletwa na Kiongozi wa Wengi  na wakati umefika kwamba sisi viongozi twende mas hinani, 
tuhudumie wananchi wetu  na pia v yenye Mhe. Samba amesema tuwe na wakati wa kukaa na 
familia zetu pia. Ya pili Mhe. Sp ika sisi kama chama yenye inatawala Afrika ... 
 
[Applause ] 
 
 Chama cha ODM unajua tuko  na By-election  tatu, tuko na Msambweni tuko na Taita na 
tuko na Kilifi n a hapa ndani sisi ndio tuko wengi hata wenye wameenda Tanga T anga, lakini  
kwamba wajue kwamba ODM ndio b ado chama itazidi kutawala, na ni wakati sisi kama 
viongozi pia tutoke twende zetu, ili tuhakikishe kwamba tumeambia wananchi kwamba, 
ingekuwa leo marehemu Tom Mboya, ama marehemu Jaramogi Oginga Odinga anapatia watu 
wheelbarrow, hatungekuwa na wenye  wamefanikiwa kimaisha Mhe. Spik a, lakini hao viongoz i 
waliamua kujua maana ya elimu. ..

na sisi pia tunaenda mas hinani  na hili ni Jumba la siasa Mheshimiwa tunaenda mash inani
