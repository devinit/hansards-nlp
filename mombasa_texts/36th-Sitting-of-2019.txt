 Hon. Bwire:  Thank you Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker Sir I am not  a Member of the 
said Committee  but I have a concern , I think the leadership of this House must draw lines ; we 
have ent ertained this for several days and now there is neither Member nor eve n Chair nor 
even the Vice Chair ! You are a Member of the said Committee and you have no response 
meaning that this Committee  has not done what was directed  by the Chair to bring the 
response of the  Statements made by the Hon . Members at the grassroots .

Page 2  I think Mr. Speaker something  has to be done on those Committee s that are not 
serious on assignments that are being given b y the House ; you should  serve some  disciplin ary 
measures. .. 
(Applause)  
 So I pray that you just do not leave it like that you give some directives which will 
compel the Committee and its membership to come up with  the best disciplinary measures. 
Thank you.  
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu ): Thank you. As far as what has been the  
concern of Hon. Bwire he has expressed before  this House disciplinary action  to be taken 
against the Committees that are not responding to this Hon ourable House and I am sure the 
Assembly has to have  a Powers and P riviledge C ommittee that is supposed to work on issues 
of the same. So we will communicate to the Speaker to formulate the Committee and work 
upon such issues and make sure that the Committees will be vibrant and will not repeat what 
we have been seeing in  this Assembly. So we will communicate to the Speaker to at least call 
upon those Committees concerned. Yes Clerk?

Page 3  The Member w as here and he never responded, and he is now responding on what 
you ha d already given directives over ; I think he should just answer Order No.9 than again 
revisi ting what you have already given directives, he was not here let them abide by the 
directives g iven by the Chair. Thank you.  
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes Hon. Kibwana respond on the status of 
the road raised by the Chief Whip . 
 Hon. Kibwana Swaleh : Thank you Hon . Speaker. I think Hon. Speaker my 
colleague is worried but wh at I was saying I was really expressing my satisfaction on what 
you have ruled out . So it is no  harm when I just commend you  for what you have said. 
Nevertheless Hon. Speaker I think as a Committee we have not yet received any response 
from the Departmen t of Transport, Infrastructure and Public Works on this issue , maybe on 
behalf of the Chair and the other Members Hon. Speaker I think it is a follow up and we will 
be glad if you will allow us to come back again with response next week Thursday. Thank 
you. 
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon.  Mwalimu) : Thank you. So you have committed your 
Committee that you will respond to this H onourable House in a weeks  time? It is noted. Yes
