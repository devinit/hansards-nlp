CONSTRUCTION OF STORM WATER SYSTE M IN HAMISI ESTATE IN 
CHANGAMWE  
Mr. Speaker Sir I beg to give notice of the following Motion;  
THAT AWARE THAT  the Cou nty government is charged with the responsibility of 
Public Works and Services including storm water management systems in built up areas, 
under Part Two (11) (a) of the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution of Kenya 2010;  
FURTHER AWARE THAT  storm water syst ems ensure that the rain is channelled 
properly and hence flooding is curbed;  
CONCERNED THAT  Hamisi Estate which is located in Changamwe Ward, currently 
does not have a storm water drainage system which may lead to flooding not only within the 
estate but a lso in the surrounding areas leading to catastrophe;  
I therefore urge this Assembly to RESOLVE  that; 
The County government through the Department of Public Works and Department of 
Infrastructure to construct a storm water drainage system in Hamisi Estate t o curb perennial 
water floods.
