HANSARD REPORT  
Wednesday, 15th June, 2016  
The House met at 2: 37p.m. 
(Mr. Speaker (Hon. Thadius Rajwayi) in the Chair)  
PRAYERS  
       Mr. Speaker (Hon. Rajwayi) : Hon.  Members kindly have your seats, yes Hon.  Mohamed  
Chiro Ndanda . I want to believe you have never been involved in  the camera in the proceedings 
of the Assembly , can you leave that to the H ansard departmen t and Public Relation s. Yes Clerk . 
STATEMENT  
       Hon.  Mohamed Chiro Ndanda . 
       Hon. Mohamed Ndanda : Ahsante Mheshimiwa  Spika . Mheshimiwa  Spika kama 
tunavyoju a nchi yoyote hujengwa na pesa, majengo yote yanahitaji pesa ; kuna shida ya 
ukusanyaji wa fedha , mimi binafsi wakati tukiwa katika likizo ya Bunge  hili nikiwa kule 
vichochoroni na manyumbani niliweza kutembea n a nikaona mambo ambayo leo nimekuja nayo 
hapa Bunge  ili wenzangu waweze kus ikiza na watoe  maoni yao . Mheshimiwa  Spika  
ninazungumzia kuhusu hizi l eseni  zetu, utapata duka l inatakikana kulipishwa Kshs. 7,750 
biashara zile zingine unapata ni Kshs. 4,500 tukic hukulia mtu ambaye anataka kufanya zile 
biashara ndogo ndogo  uwezo labda wa  ile fedha  yake ya  kuanzia biashara ni kama Kshs. 1000 , 
leseni ni Kshs. 4500 , inaku wa ni vigumu sana kw a huyu mtu kulipa kwa mara moja . Hapo hapo 
utaona Mheshimiwa  Spika ukiangali a barabara moja ina maduka kama 40, leseni ni 10 peke e 
yake ; hili ni jambo ambalo niliweza kuliona na leo nikawa naleta taarifa  ili tuweze ku lijadili 
nikiwa na lengo ya kuwa kama itawez ekan a. Leseni  hata kama ni hi yo Kshs. 7,750  lakini 
wana biashara w aruhusiwe pesa hii waweze kuilipa hata kama ni mara nne kwa mwaka  ama 
ikiwezekana pia kwa mwezi iwe itawezekana  iwe kuna nafasi  ya ku wa yule ambaye anaweza 
kulipa aw eze kulipa kama mara nne kwa mwaka  ama kwa mwezi ama  kwa kiwango ambacho 
sisi tutaweza kukusanya  pesa. N asema hivi kwa  sababu Mheshimiwa  Spika wakati mwingi  sana 
kwa mfano, zile barabara zetu  Frere Town na Kadzandani kwa sababu huko ndio natoka utapata 
kwamba wale watu wetu wakiwa wana enda kuangalia yale maduka ambayo hayana l eseni wakati 
mwingi s i wote ambao huletwa kortini na si kwamba tunataka watu wetu wa shikwe  lakini 
tunataka t uchangie katika kukusanya pesa W aingereza walisema effectively ili tuweze ku fanya 
malengo yetu  na miradi yetu ambayo tunaitaka katika Mombasa Kaunti ya weze kukamilika .  
       Kwa hio Mheshimiwa  Spika mimi naomba wenzangu na uamuzi wangu kama utakuba lika; 
jambo hili liangaliwe kwa kina  Wanabiashara wengi sas a hivi biashara zimerudi chini .        
Mombasa hakuna mashamba ya kulima , Mombasa  ni pahali pa biashara kwa hivyo  hizi leseni  
zetu kama itawezekana Mheshimiwa  Spika tuweze kupewa ruh usa ama tu toke tu  na uamuzi 
mzuri ya  kuwa watu sasa waweze sasa kulipa  mara nne kwa mwaka ama kwa wakati ule 
wanaweza ku wekewa kisheria  ili tuweze kuwasaidia . Ahsante sana Bwana  Spika.  
       Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Rajwayi) : Yes Hon.  Jimmy . 
       Hon. Odari: Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa  Spika mimi ningetaka kumuunga mkono 
Mheshimiwa  aliyetoka kuongea sasa hivi Mheshimiwa  wa Wo di ya  Kadzandani  Mheshimiwa  
Mohamed  Ndanda . Mheshimiwa  Spika  Serikali ya Kaunti  ya Mombasa  imekosa pesa ny ingi 
sana kutokana na wale wanabiashara ambao hawalipi  ile kodi mwaka mzima ambao wakati 
mwengine k ama ni kubwa zaidi huishia kunyenyekea mbele ya mji huu mbal i ya wale ma afisa 
June 15, 2016                            COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                           58 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 2 wetu na badili yake wanat oa kitu kidogo ili  waachiwe kuendelea na biashara.  Kile kitu kidogo 
Mheshimiwa  Spika kinachukuliwa lakini hakiji katika mfuko wa Kaunti ya Mombasa bali 
kinakwenda kwenye mifuko ya ha wa maafisa wetu na kwa njia hiyo serikali ya K aunti inapote za 
mamilioni ya pe sa ambazo badal a ya kw enda kwenye  mfuko wa K aunti  na kuleta maendeleo 
inaishia mifuko ya watu bina fsi ambao ni wafanyikazi wetu. Kwa hio Mheshimiwa  Spika 
nasema naunga mkono hilo wazo la kusema leseni baad hi yake ama ikiwezekana zote  ziwe 
zikienda kulipwa sio eti  zinalipwa mwaka mzima  ama ikiwezekana mara nne kwa mwaka  
alivyo pendekeza Mheshimiwa  Ndanda . Vile ilivyo ili iwe nafuu kwa hawa wafanyi  biashara 
wetu ambao wengine wao hawana pato la kutosha ya kuendeleza biashara na pia  mapato yao ni 
madogo sasa inaku wa kufanikisha biashara yao inaku wa ni kikwazo  kikubwa  na biashara 
zengine leseni zinakuwa kubwa  inafika Kshs. 10,000  na zaidi hata Kshs. 20,000 na kwa mtu wa 
kuuza njugu ama mtu wa biashara ndogo ya  reja reja inaku wa ni kazi ngumu sana kwake.  Hivyo 
basi inafa nya baadhi ya watu wetu wasiweze kufanya biashara kwa  sababu ya kuogopa leseni 
inabakia wao kufukuzana na maaskari huko mtaani kwa sababu hawana leseni  ama hawajalipa 
hiyo ada ya Kaunti .  
       Kwa hivyo Mheshimiwa  Spika mimi nahimiza B unge hili likubali na mswada wa 
Mheshimiwa  Ndanda ili watu wetu waf anyi biashara hapa nje wapate nafuu wasi endelee  
kunyanyaswa na maaskari wetu kwa kuwa hawawezi kulipa hiyo leseni ambayo ni pesa ny ingi 
sana. Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa  Spika. 
       Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Rajwayi) : Yes Hon.  Patrick Muriuki Siminyu .  
       Hon. Siminyu:  Thank you Mr. Speaker  for giving me this opportunity.  Mr. Speaker  I 
remember there was a  meeting when we were looking at the Mombasa C ounty  Trade Licensing 
Bill that was passed here and i was the only  Member who was c oncerned about that . Mr. Speaker  
i just want to say this during the making of the Bill M embers have to be active and see that  
matters that  are going to affect the people of Mombasa  are looked into;  it  is a good thing 
because Mombasa C ounty is losing a lot of money.  Mr. Speaker  so many pe ople are not paying 
the required money, some are  just ski pping because if you tell some one to pay Kshs. 1200  or 
Kshs. 1500  per year is a lot of money  but if you divide it into equivalent to the way we are 
paying o ur insurance,  we can pay for our insurance cover for six months or a month and it makes 
it easier for us to operate our businesses . For those who are operating within the Central Business 
District (CBD) we will understand that concept Mr. Speaker  Sir and  people are  able to pay 
because it seems cheaper but if you s ay the money to be paid in a lump s um  it becomes very 
difficult . So Mr. Speaker  it is a very good idea and I pray for it to be put to the relevant 
Committee so that it can be  looke d at again so that we c an see if it can be implemented . Thank 
you. 
       Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Rajwayi) :  Hon.  Nyamvula . 
       Hon. (Mrs.) Nyamvula: Thank you Mr. Speaker . Mr. Speaker  I stand to concur with his 
statement that it is not an issue. Mr. Speaker  I want to remind the Hon.  Members that as Finance 
Committee we came up with ideas where collection of taxes will be done and we take it to the 
Executive.  One of our proposals was that these people whether big or small are willing to pay 
and we had  proposed that w e do m obile form  collection ; for example if you want to collect in  
Frere T own maybe on a Tuesday  you take your tax there  protected by the  right security as you 
collect the information is passed through the system and you move on . Unfortunate ly this has not 
been d one and we must understand the C ounty government does not have a factory , the county 
government does not own Bamburi cement, the C ounty government’s money and the national 
June 15, 2016                            COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                           58 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 3 governments money comes from taxes  Mr. Speaker . Just as Hon.  Ndanda has said I was also 
among ... in fact i saw it happen I was in the estate  and i t was  in the morning and when I saw 
County canter stand we pass ed each other into Kisimani way here to Frere Town and on my w ay 
out not knowing what had happened . I went out and found all those  in Kisimani area , we have  
hawkers  and they had been knocked down , every thing had been bundled together and these are 
women and youths men who  just sell vegetables to ensure their children go back to school,  put 
food on the table but they had all been pushed to one place with tables upside down.   
       Mr. Speaker  I did come out and went and addressed them and asked them what was the 
matter and they  told me that the askaris  had come in there and I told them I saw them but I didn ’t 
know what they were doing in short and then  I realized these tables , these ladies and men who 
sell they are charged twenty shillings per day . The issue here Mr. Speaker  is the collection  of 
these money , that is my issue; d efinitely  we all pay taxes but most of us don't know the twenty 
shillings is more than those who pay ten thousand shillings  per year and this is where we are 
losing our money because the collection is paid they collect  and they go. I asked them how much 
do you pay they said we pay so an d so twenty shillings ; so how do you  get a receipt they said no 
receipt this is where we are having an issue , if the exe cutive had agreed on the mobile form of 
payment we would not have these and then secondly he or she pays twenty shillings per day and 
then he gets harassed . So they are not permanent they do not have confidence ; In fact  I 
intervened and I called the County Secretary Mr. Thoya and he told me that the local  Sub C ounty 
offices for revenue collec tors will be answerable to them but am gl ad to say within a short time 
after going home these men and women put their tables back and u p to today they are  there but 
Mr. Speaker  the issue is  within the Trade department and am sure the C hairman  of Trade will 
agree with me that it is the implementat ion that has a problem.  Thank you , Mr. Speaker .  
       Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Rajwayi) : Yes let's hear from Hon.  Hudson Karume before we hear 
from Hon.  Ibrahim Kondo . 
       Hon. Karume : Thank you Mr. Speaker  Sir, first and fore most I w ould like to congratulat e 
Hon.  Ndanda for bringing this statement which will assist us as a C ounty  to come up with  
measures which will emphasize to  ensure that we improve on our revenue collection  which in the 
far end enabled us as a C ounty government to realize our agenda. Mr. Speaker  first and forem ost 
I think it is high time that  we need to conceptualize with M ombasa C ounty Trade Licensing A ct 
if it was accented by the government . We need  to first of all make sure that we conceptualize 
with it and as my Hon.  colleague  Hon.  Simi nyu has already decided it's a high time if at all there 
is a need  for us  to review and to look at this Act and do the amendments at the right time because 
as it stands we always say that it is  important for us to focus on our people to ensure that rather 
than improving our r evenue collection we also e nsure that we put into consideration the needs of 
our living residents of Mombasa . We need to know how do we imp rove that because if we were 
to look into these issue s probably Mr. Speaker  we would reali ze that we do have our colleagues 
who are in the public  sector transport who always pay on a  monthly basis but we will realize that  
they have other means of paying which is cheaper than paying on a monthly basis . But this need s 
to be addressed , so Mr. Spea ker Sir we need to decide if we should pay on monthly basis and if 
you delay one should pay penalties ; we will also make more revenue without having any 
difficulties . 
       So Mr. Speaker I think it is an idea that needs to be addressed and if at all the Committee , 
we seek for your direction the relevant C ommittee  to come up with the Bill so that we can look 
into it so as to make sure that we come with the relevant  amendments. T hank you so much Mr. 
Speaker . 
       Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Rajwayi) :  Yes Hon.  Ibrahim Kondo .

kutokana na swala limewekwa mbele yetu  nikiamini Mombasa Kaunti linahitaji mapato 
kuhakikisha kwamba tunapata pato letu.  Ningependa kuambia Jumba hili ya kw amba 
aliyo yasema Mheshimiwa  Serah Nyamvula ni mambo yako na kama Kamati  ya wana biashara 
iko na mikakati ya kuende leza shughul i hizo kwa njia inayo stahili . Kwa sababu hapo nyuma 
kuliku wa kuna  pingamizi kidogo lakini kupitia kwa shi rika la Benki ya Dunia  tulianza ku weka 
mikakati y a kulipa katika  Kamati  zetu na vile  vile kuna  mambo ambayo mpaka sasa hayajakuwa 
na karibuni yatakuweko katika mtandao na vile vile ukiangalia  kuna leseni zinazolipwa kupitia 
kwa mtandao na vile vile wafanyi  biashara hawa wadogo wado go kama vile Mheshimiwa 
Nyamvula alivyosema kuna baadhi ya mapato kupotea . Tuko na mikakati ya kuanza kulipa 
kupitia mitandao yet u ya simu  kama Mpesa ili kuha kikisha zile pesa hazi potei katika mikono ya 
wananchi;  vile vile tuko na mikakati zaidi ya kutoka kwa hili hili kama nilivyosema shirika la 
Benki ya Dunia . Mungu akitujaalia mwezi  wa kumi na moja  tutaweza kupeleka wafanyi  kazi 
wetu kwenye mafundisho ya kuhakikisha ku wa stakabadhi muhimu zaidi za kufanya kazi  katika 
masuala haya na mwisho Mheshimiwa Sp ika ningetaka wenzangu ambao wanaangalia na kujali 
maslahi ya wananchi wa Mombasa . Vile vile pia ningependa ku mpongeza Bwana  Jimmy Odari 
kwa kufanya harusi hata kama hakutualika na vile vile ningemuom ba Mheshimiwa Mwidani 
baada ya R amadhani atengene ze nyimbo maridadi kwa ajili ya Bwana harusi wetu Mheshimiwa 
Jimmy Odari ... 
(Applause ) 
       Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika . 
(Applause ) 
       Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Rajwayi) : Well in deed ladies and gentlemen we have to  remind 
ourselves that one is the statement th at was made by Hon.  Hudson Karume which looked into the 
matters affecting our people and all of us in this great H ouse needs to have power over the 
people  and leave alone the issue of dictatorship and arrogance  and the right word is 
empowerment . Empowermen t is the key word  and for us to talk of empowerment if we destroy 
and bring down the  structures that have been made by those innocent people my concern is that 
the government will answer. My next concern is that Hon.  Mohamed  Ndanda have been perusing 
all the documents before me ; it's a statement without a written document so you can build it up in 
terms of some more content and I would ur ge that you reconsider because there is a lot that needs 
to be done in terms of  this particular idea  and take it back to the House Business Committee so 
that it can be brought ba ck to the House for more discussions. Yes Clerk . 
STATEMENT  
       Hon.  Riziki Fundi .  
       Hon. Fundi : Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa Spika  nimesimama tena kwa mara nyingine 
kuhusiana na swala ambalo liko  mbele ya hii Nyumba . Kuna kidaraja ambacho kinapatikana 
hapo Bamburi baada ya kupita pale Bamburi kuelekea Utange ; Mheshimiwa Spika  daraja lile 
liko katika hali mbaya sana  na nikisema kuna muhimu katika Bunge  hili kufuatilia hili swala na 
hata Kamati  ya Uchukuzi  imewahi kufanya  site visit  katika daraja hili . Lakini Mheshimiwa Spika  
mpaka  saa hii hakuna  jambo l olote ambalo limeshafanywa mbali na ile kazi iliyofany wa wakati 
ule wa  hofu hofu ya El nino lakini hakuna kitu kimefanywa. Mheshimiwa Spika  ukifika pale 
katika ile sehemu utaona kwamba tunangojea maafa yatokee halafu tuanze kupiga kelele 
kwamba  tumefiliwa na watu na tume huzunika na wakati swala l enyewe liko peupe .        
Mheshimiwa Spika  ningeomba kupitia kwa kiti chako sababu inaonekana Kamati ya Uch ukuzi 
June 15, 2016                            COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                           58 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 5 hailichukulii swala hili muhimu kama inaweza kuundwa  Kamati ya  Select   ikachunguza swala 
hili kwa sababu hali iliyoko pale ni hali ya kusikitisha kwa  sababu wakati wowote tunaweza 
kupata madhara m akubwa yakatukuta sisi kama wakazi wa Mombasa.  Mheshimiwa Spika  daraja  
yenyewe ni nyembamba halafu  lami yenyewe imekwisha halafu barabara yenyewe yametokea 
mashimo makubwa ambayo magari yakipita pale ni lazima  moja lisimame lingine lipite  alafu 
ndio ling ine nalo ndio liweze kupita . Mheshimiwa Spika  swala hili iwapo halita chukul iwa 
umuhimu basi tuna u hakika tunangojea vilio na maafa ambayo baadae  tutakuja kulia machozi ya 
mamba  kwamba tumefiliwa na watu lakini badala ya kuzuia tunangoja kuja kutibu .       
Mheshimiwa Spika  hili ni swala ambalo  limesha wahi kuja kwenye B unge hili mara mingi ; kwa 
hivyo nin gependa K iti chako kichukulie jambo hili muhimu ikiwezekana Kamati ya Select  
ichaguliwe iende ikaangalie jambo hili na ikiwezekana iwe itakua Kamati mbili; ya Bunge na ya 
executive  ili waone ile hali ili yo katika sehemu ya  Bamburi kwa lile daraja. Mheshimiwa Spika  
mimi kama Mwakilishi wa B amburi inaku wa siku zote ni  sababu kuwa kazi haifanywi na sisi 
tunasema ule ukweli kwamba ingawa tuna hamu ya lile daraja l itengenezwe lakini sisi kama 
MCA  hatuna uwezo wa kufanya kazi hiyo kwa sababu haturuhusi wi kikatiba . Kwa hio wale 
ambao wamekubaliwa kikatiba kutekeleza jambo hili walichukulie muhimu n a hili swala liweze 
kuangaliwa haraka inavy owezekana . Ahsante Bwana Spika.  
       Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Rajwayi) : Well I agree with  you on this and infact the most dangerous 
structure that is lying t here is that building . I know the concern and the bitterness that you have 
but before we give a Select committee is that the committee on Transport  can still do something 
so the Committee in charge of you must not allow this to pass just like that because you must 
allow and you need to address specific  question s because you need to make sure when you need 
to put better the situation in that area and we must agree that work to deal  with the matter as soon 
as possible and am directing the relevant committee to report to this Hon.  House by not later than 
next week on Wednesday 22nd June, 2016 and they must report to the Committee of the House 
Business on the progress of the matter. Yes Clerk . 
(Applause ) 
STATEMENT  
       Hon.  Madundo . 
       Hon. Mohamed  Madundo : Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa Spika  kwa kunipa nafasi  kutoa 
taarifa  yangu juu ya muundo msingi wa maji taka  ambayo ndio shida tunayopata Shika  Adabu na 
sana hii shida inakuja sehemu  za Ujamaa pale ambapo ilikuwa ni shamba la Waitiki . Hapo 
mahali imekuwa ni kama donda sugu mvua ikinyesha maji yanaingia kwa manyumba  na nafikiri 
hata mwak a jana pia nishaleta jambo hili na juzi pia nilichukua ma  Engineer  nikaenda 
nikawaonyesha mahali hap o palipo na tatizo lakini mpaka sasa hatujapata majibu yoyote  na 
wakafanya mambo yote . Kwa hivyo Mheshimiwa Spika  nasema  hivi, tusiende tukawafanyia 
wananchi wetu mambo yasiyoeleweka lakini mimi naona ni muhimu tuzibe ufa mapema kuliko  
tungoje maafa . Imech ukua muda sana manake hapo mahali sasa mvua imeisha ha yo mambo ya 
muundo msingi wa maji taka yashughulikiwe na hatuwaingililii kwa kuwa wanajua kazi zao 
zinavyo fanywa . Mbeleni wali kua wamesema kutachimbwa visima ambavyo maji yataingia hapo 
ndani lakini mpa ka wa leo hakuna dalili na wananchi bado wana shida  kuhusu hiyo sehemu  
ambapo hapo mahali mvua iki shanyesha hakuna mahali pa kupitia na maji yanaingia kwa 
manyumba ya watu . Kwa hivyo ningechukua nafasi hii Mheshimiwa Spika  kupitia kwa kiti

       Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Rajwayi) : Yes are you on the same concern . 
       Hon. Mohamed  Ndanda : Mheshimiwa Spik a ile sehemu ambayo amezungumzia 
Mheshimiwa  inatumiwa na watu  wote wa Mombasa na pale mahali nilikuwa nataka tu  
kumpongeza  kwa kuileta na hizo sehemu ni ny ingi na zile sehemu ambazo  zinaweka maji na  
katika  zile sehemu hatari na hiyo hatari ni lazima sasa t uangalie pia kampeni  ziko karibu na sisi 
wanasiasa chakula  chetu ni siasa . Pale mahali Mheshimiwa Spika , sehemu  zote kama  hizo

jopo fulani ambapo litakuwa kila pahali amb apo pana zile athari za kuleta maisha ya watu katika
