Page 2  Hon. Kibwana? Hon . Kibwana there is a statement b y Hon. Charles Kitula, do you 
have any reply or you need...  
 
(Interruption)  
 
Hon. Kibwana Swaleh : Thank you Hon. Speaker. Hon. Spea ker I  think I  will be 
unable  to give a comprehensive response  on this  issue , so I just ask my colleague in this 
Honourable  House t o give me more time so that I can co me with a good response. Thank 
you. 
 
The Temporary Sp eaker  (Hon. Amur) : Hon. Kibwana exactly how long do you 
want? Because the Assembly will be heading for recess soon and this is a burning issue. So 
how long do you think, next week will it be possible?  
 
Hon. Kibwana Baya:  Maybe I just get direction because today we were given  a 
Petition  and when I loo k at this Statement it is also on the same issue raised here today. So if 
it is the same issue I think we were given an opportunity  to sit within  the period so that at the 
end of the long recess  we will be able to respond. I think that is what I  can get f rom this 
Statement. It  is the same issue that  is happ ening on the issue of Methadone ; and so if it is the 
same issue Hon. Speaker I think I will not be able to give it before we go for recess , my 
friend will  have to  wait for me until we c ome back after the long recess. Thank you.  
 
The Temporary Speaker  (Hon. Amur) : Thank you , that is acceptable. Yes Clerk?

(Interruption)  
 
The Chief Whip (Hon. Kitula) : Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti Taarifa! Mheshimiwa 
Mwenyekiti swala hili la ma swala ya F edha  mimi kama Mheshimiwa wa Frere Town 
nisingependa kwa maoni yangu i weze kuchukuliwa n a Kamati ya F edha  kwa sababu Kamati 
ya F edha  kwa Bunge hili inafahamika kwamba kuna ushirikiano mkubwa na  Wizara  ya 
Fedha . Maswala ya pending bills kwa m aombi yangu ingetengezewa kama Kamati ya Ad Hoc 
waweze kuchunguza Waziri  na kutuletea orodha  ya pending bills zote za FY 2017/2018 na 
2018/2019 lakini kwa maoni y angu sina imani kama Kamati ya Fedha  italeta mapendekezo 
yanayosta hili katika Bunge hili.  
 
The Temporary Speaker  (Hon. Amur) : Hon. Kitula since the issue was brought by 
Hon. Bwire and you are reading on behalf it will be wise if the Chair or the Vice Chair could 
have been here so that we hear from them and then if so you have any doubt then we will 
decide then when we reach at th at stage if we will appoint an Ad Hoc Committee but in the 
meantime let us he ar from the Committee first before we jump the gun. Please give us up to 
next week so that the Chair or Vice Chair can express what they can say Hon. Kitula. Are we 
fair enough Hon. Kitula? Is it acceptable by you?  
 
(The Chief Whi p (Hon. Kitula ) nodded) 
 
Okay Clerk , next Order?

The Temporary Speaker  (Hon. Murfad Amur) : Yes. 
  
The Chief Whip (Hon. Kitula) :  Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti hii Taarifa  nilileta wiki 
mbili zilizopita na Mwenyekiti wa Kamati hii akaweza kuomba Bunge hili apatiwe wiki 
mbili ili aweze kuleta hayo majibu na ilikuwa ni kitu  cha kwenda VOK na kuja kuleta Ripoti 
yao katika Bunge hili. Lakini la kushangaza leo Mwanakamati anasema apatiwe muda 
mwengine , wa nini Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti  wakati swala hili ni kwenda VOK na  kuja 
kuleta mapendekezo kwamba je hayo maduka ya nayojengwa wamef uata sh eria au la?

Hon. Kibwana Swaleh:  Thank you Hon. Speaker . I think Hon. Speaker we should 
follow the procedures ; I will be happy if my brother is elected the Deputy Majority but we 
may end up misleading this Hon ourable  House, it will be like a drama that we allow someone 
to be Deputy while it is not official . So also to give us the opportunity to ask the office of the 
Leader of Majority beca use it will proper  if he is not around, I think he could give out the 
response on this issue . So I think it is something that the leadership of this House should 
consider if somebody is not around the office is still there, so I think we should not mislead 
this House. I would wish a s I say he is a colleague but maybe it will go against our rules and 
procedures. Thank you.  
 
The Temporary Speaker (Hon. Murfad Amur) : Thank you Hon. Kibwana. Then I 
defer this iss ue until next week . Next order Clerk?

 Hon. Thoya:  It is more than urgent because ni mahali maisha ya mtu yalipotea na 
kwa sasa hivi haijulikani itaend a vipi, ningependa kuweza hiyo Kamati kama wana  ufahamu 
kwamba pale Birikani , mtaa wa Birikani kuna zile chamber  ama visima vya Mombasa Water  
ambapo watoto huenda wakacheza na vile visima huwa viko wazi na wiki iliyopita kuna 
mtoto ambaye alikuwa akicheza hapo akitafuta maembe alizama na akafa na kwa sasa hivi 
kuna mipango ya mazishi lakini ni kama ambaye Momba sa Water  wanajaribu kutelekeza 
hiyo na ikiwa vile visima viko wazi  ni matarajio kwamba watu wengi watazidi kuzama 
hususan watoto wa Kibarani  na maeneo ambayo yako pale. Je, wana ufahamu wa hilo na 
kama wana ufahamu, ni mipango gani ipo ya kuweza kusimama na ile familia na kuna 
mipango gani ya kuhakikisha kwamba vile visima vitafunikwa ili tusiweze kupata maafa zaidi 
na nasema hiyo ni dharura kwa sababu sasa hivi mwili huo uko mortuary  pale Makadara  na 
familia hiyo haina mbele wala nyuma na Mombasa Water  ni kama ambaye wanatelekeza 
wanasema  hatuna jukumu.

Hospital may be to seek a waiver or something like that , can the C ommittee do that at least to 
help the family so that they can even be given t he waiver since it was something that was not 
expected by the family, are you in a position to do so?  
 
 Hon. Mwalimu Mwisho:  Thank you Mr. Speaker, i will try my best to do so. Thank 
you.
