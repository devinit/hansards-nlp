RESPONSE TO STATEMEN T BY CHAIRPERSON COM MITTEE OF EDUCATION , INFORMATION 
TECHNOLOGY AND MV 2035  ON STATUS O F KWA HOLA ECDE CENT RE 
 
 Yes Hon. Ibrahim Omondi?  
 
 Hon. Omondi:  Thank you Mr. Speaker S ir. As I can see a s ign of success ahead  because 
you have just referred me as Hon. Hatimy but I am Ibrahim Omondi. Mr. Speaker Sir I stand 
with your perm ission to give a response on a S tatement that was raised by the Member of Kipevu 
Ward Hon. Faith Mwende on issues concerning the status of  Kwa Hola  ECD Centre.  
 Mr. Speaker Sir  the response  was indeed com municated from the respective  D epartment 
but we had a meeting and  we did deliberate intensively on that particular respo nse that was given 
by the same D epartment but our findings was that  the response did not meet the merit s of what 
we expected from the D epartment , and therefore as the C ommittee we decided that the part icular 
response should not see the light of day, and  in this particular Honourable  House and therefore 
we threw that particular response away.  
 The reco mmendation that we made by the C ommittee was that the Chief Officers of the 
Department to appear before  the C ommittee on Tuesday morning . 
July 1 1, 2019                             COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                           58 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information  
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor Page 4  This is to allow them to give a very com prehensive reports on the same which will satisfy 
the Member and also not only the Member because this i ssue is touching on various EC D centres 
in our County . That is where we are thank you Mr. Speaker Sir.  
 
(Applause)  
 
 The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Thank you Hon. Ibrahim and I can see also the  
Hon. Member  who brought this S tatement from Kipevu Ward, she i s very much satisfied by 
your response so the House will be waiting for  the response as you  have said you found that it 
has no merit, so we  will be waiting for the response tha t the C ommittee will see that it got merit s 
to see the floor of the House  so that the p eople from Kwa Hola and Kipevu W ard at large will 
start enjoying  the services of Education D epartment and the County at large.  
 
 Hon. Omondi: Most obliged  Mr. Speaker Sir . I also stand on Standing O rder 41(2) ( c)  
and I would like to give a S tatement if am allowed Mr. Speaker Sir?  
 
 The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Just a minute Hon. Ibrahim am consulting ... 
 
(Consultations)  
 
 The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu):  Okay proceed . 
  
 Hon. Omondi:  Thank you very much Mr. Speaker Sir . It is a very touching issue which I 
want to direct to the Chair Labour Committee. Mr. Speake r Sir, we  have had a culture where 
most of the employees in the companies where they are  working especially the t ransport 
companies, are being handle d like ugali if I may use that particular term whereby you simply 
mingle it and put it in your mouth. A s I want to emphasize to use that term to emphasize Mr. 
Speaker Sir if you may allow me.  
 Mr. Speaker Sir I want this to serve as an example, it  is a company called Abebe 
Transport, situated in Port  Reitz, this company dismissed employees without notice, with out 
them being paid their duties and without proper reason s as to why they have been dismisse d. I 
know this has been happening  to very many companies in our W ards but I want to direct this to 
the Chairman of Labour to come with a lot of force to address th is particular issue Mr. Speaker 
Sir, so that it shows an example to other companies which are doing that.  
 Mr. Speaker Sir  the following people one  Derrick  from Mshomoroni, two Kennedy from 
Miritini, three Christine Juma from Airport W ard and very many oth ers which I have not 
mention ed have fallen  victim s of this particular company and therefore I request the Chairman 
of  Labour to investigate intensively ; I may use the word intensively because it seems there are a 
lot of activities which are going on in t hat particular company  which are not at par with our 
Constitution  or with our County government C onstitution . Thank you Mr. Speaker S ir. 
 
 The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Thank you Hon. Ibrahim and I think the Chair 
Labour is around , you will share with the Labour Chair plus the C ommittee the names of the 
company and affected individual s, so that t he Labour Committee may fast -track and bring back 
the response on that issue. Yes Hon. Samba? Yes Hon. Bwire before Hon. Samba?  
July 1 1, 2019                             COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                           58 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information

said Committee and as a Member am concern ed with  the terms that ha ve been used by the Hon. 
Member . Mr. Speaker, we may not be able to get the full meaning of intensively or something 
maybe he c larifies bef ore you direct the C ommittee to have a sitting together kindly please, am 
sure my Chairman is also not conversant with it the term used by the Member.  
 
 The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Okay thank you Hon. Raphael Bwire . Yes Hon. 
Ibrahim?  
 
 Hon. Omondi: Mr. Speaker Sir . 
 
(Interruption)  
 
 The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Use your mic rophone.  
 
 Hon. Omondi: Sorry with your respect and your permission, I would like the Member to 
clarify to enlist the terms Mr. Speaker Sir that he could not understand so th at I may clarify those 
terms to them. Thank you.  
 
 Hon. Bwire:  With your permission Mr. Speaker I may repeat he has used the term maybe 
my fellow colle agues can pronounce but am unable â€˜intensivelyâ€™, combanies  you see Mr. 
Speaker â€˜ combaniesâ€™  those are the terms I mean I cannot be able to clarify maybe you come out 
clear Hon. Member. Thank you.  
  
 Hon. Omondi:  Hon. Member from Mishomoroniâ€¦  
 
(Interruption)  
 
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Junda, Jundaâ€¦  
 
(Laughter)  
 
 Junda Ward . 
 
 Hon. Omondi:  Yeah Junda W ard, sorry for the term Mr. Speaker . With due respect it has 
been captured well with the Hansard the term I used Mr. Speak er they should be investigated 
intensively . I said , intensively;  yes Mr. Speaker Sir unless if there i s a question about it, the 
meani ng of investigating intensively is actually getting all the information , going deep into it not 
just doing ... its going deep and even reaching to the owner of that particular company and getting 
the right report, ndani ndani kabisa . Thank you.  
  
 The Depu ty Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : I think the concern by the Hon. Member is how 
you pronounce it; your pronunciation. Yes Chair?  
 
 Hon. Thoya:  Thank you Mr. Speaker . I am happy that some of my Member s seek for  
clarifications but to me is in -depth  clarification, i n depth investigation . 
July 1 1, 2019                             COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                           58 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information  
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor Page 6  But sometimes when Hon. Ibrahim Omondi emphasize s on it you will hear as if it is from 
Amer ica today but we will do the in -depth investigation and I should believe in 14 days we are 
going to  be back with the report. Thank you for th ose vocabularies but we will do  a fair job to 
your S tatement. Thank you.  
 
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Thank you . 
 
 Hon. Omondi:  Point of Information Mr. Speaker Sir . 
  
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Information on what and the Chair of Labour 
has said that . 
  
 Hon. Omondi:  Point of Information  Mr. Speaker Sir ! I do not want words to be put in 
my mouth. Mr. Speaker Sir I want to be heard very carefully I used the term intensively  and it is 
the right term Mr. Speaker Sirâ€¦  
 
(Laughter)  
 
 And if the re is somebody doubting that word was used wrongly this time we are digital.  
 
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes Hon. Nyiro? Hon. Ibrahim let Hon. Nyiro 
raise concern . 
 
 Hon. Nyiro:  Maybe because of where I come from I do  not suffer the problem of 
pronunciation so maybe I will be able to help the term Hon. Bomoa  used; was i t intensively  but 
you are pronouncing it indensively  so that  is where the problem is , so intensive and in -depth is 
the same thingâ€¦  
 
(Applause)  
 
 Yes kwa kina na kwa upana ; intensive ly and in -depth. Thank you but you are 
pronouncing it indensively , combany  that is the problem.  
 
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Thank you Hon. Nyiro. Ho n. Ibrahim you are 
out of order! C onsult on a low tone. Yes Hon. Tobias Samba?

 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Proceed . 
  
 Hon. Samba:  Thank you. I would like to seek a S tatement from the Chair of Education 
and ICT on bursary of college  and universities. Hon. Speaker I do  not know the reasons why 
when it comes to the issue of bursaries we need to put pressure and mind you we have done t he 
main budget and two supplementary budget s of which as at now if the bursary is to help maybe 
others who are in form fours last two years they have been benefitted .

weeks, three weeks the Committee on Education had site visit long way back before even we 
went for recess t hey ought  to have the report as we speak now .  
 Mr. Speaker, they have never reported back to the House I do  not know whether they 
reported bac k to House because there was a S tatement they were to go on a site visit and bring 
back the report to this House  and I do not know the reason as to why the C hairman is keeping on 
asking for one  week, two weeks and yet is in possession of the said report.  
 Even when the issue which was raised by Hon. Faith they o ught to have answer ed it here 
because they already have the report so I would wish just to call upon the Hon. Chair on 
Education and other Chairpersons kindly let us be serious we are here as the re presentatives of 
the people and we are always delaying the issues of development . 
  I would wish to end this scenario and call upon everybody who is assigned the 
responsibility to take it with a lot of seriousness. Thank you.

they have in equipping the Department of Public R elations so that they can be capturing the 
information in this  plenary very well . I understand they do  not have even a single camera, is very 
absurd for those people to be using mobile phones and whatsoever , so what plans do they have to
