person  has  inherent dignity and the right to have that dignity respected and protected as 
required for  the  Breastfeeding  mothers  in  any  public  establishment;

 factoring  th e  World  Health  Organization (WHO) recommendation  for  exclusive  
breastfeeding  of  newborns  for  six  months before  introduction  of  food  and 
continuation of  the same  until  one  to  two years of age;  
 
FURTHER APPRECIATING THAT  through breastfeeding, mothers are able to grow 
and enhance their attachment and bonding with their infants,  a  phenomenon  that  every  
mother  is  entitled  to;    
 
DISTURBED THAT  lactating mothers often feel ash amed of breastfeeding in public and 
semi-public places due to possibility of potential objections by other people, negative 
comments, or harassment not to mention the discomfort and health  risk  mothers  get  
exposed  to  for  fear  of  breastfeeding  in  public;  
 
FURTHER DISTURBED  that in the past, there h as been cases of m others being denied  
the  privilege  to  nurse  their  infants  in  public  or  semi -public establishments  due  to  
lack  of  a  designated nursing  area;   
 
I therefore urge this Asse mbly to RESOLVE  that: 
 
 The  County  Executive  moves  with  speed  to  ensure  all licensed  County  public  
establishment s, County  p ublic  service  delivery points and other workpl aces  designate  
a  conducive  nursing/b reastfeeding  areas  with  its  e nabling policy  as  a  requirement  
and  condition  for  lic ense  renewal  by  the  County g overnment of Mombasa.
