Mheshimiwa Feddis , Mwakirunge Dispensary ambayo yatakikana ilikuwa ifanyiwe ukarabati 
wakati wa s erikali ya Manispaa ya Mombasa. Ilifanyiwa ukarabati lakini ukarabati ule 
ulikuwa ni hafifu na nyumba yenyewe ni m oja tu ya daktari na sisi kama s erikali ya Kaunti 
ya Mombasa tumepitia na tukaona n yumba ile inahitaji m arekebisho ambapo itagharimu 
takriban milioni saba na elfu mia mbili (Shilingi 7.2Milioni) na iko katika hali ya kufanyika 
Mheshimiwa Spika. Kwa hivyo ilikuwa tungeomba kwamba tupewe muda kidogo ili kusudi 
hii hali ya ujenzi ipate kumalizika. Ahsante Mhesh imiwa Spika.

The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes Hon. Bwire ? 
 
Hon. Bwire : Thank you Mr. Speaker. Mr. S peaker as per the report or s tatement 
given by the Chairman  it simply means  the Committee never went to the  site to have the view 
of what the Member presented or rather demanded to be told and his Committee according to 
what he has described Mwakirunge is far and I think Mr. Speaker the Committee has to go 
for a site visit and bring a very comprehensive stateme nt. I doubt whether a renovation of on e 
house can cost  shs 7.2Million;  what  about a construction of a new h ouse. So I think we 
should again give  the Chairman and his Committee time to have a site visit and then bring the 
statement back to this House. Thank you Mr. Speaker.  
 
Hon. Ahmed Salama  Omar : Mheshimiwa Spika nafikiri ilikuwa...  
(Interruption)

Hon. Samba:  Mr. Speaker thank you for giving me this opportunity an d as I stated 
here yesterday these  young men need to be serious when they are articulating their duties. 
Hon. Speaker whenever a Member of the House see ks a statement they have every time and 
all the time possible for them to do a site visit and everything they are suppose d to be giving 
us the information that we have requested for and it is high time Hon. Speaker if they are not 
eligible enough the re are  Hon. Members , am not even the Chairman I can take over from any 
Chairman position ...

ILLEGAL CONSTRUCTION OF TWO HOUSES IN KATISHA , FRERE TOWN WARD  
 
Hon. Ahmed Salama , Chairperson for Committee on Lands, Planning and Housing.  
 
Hon. Ahmed Salama  Omar : Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika mimi kujibu hoja ya 
Bwana Mheshimiwa Kitula ni kwamba zile nyumba mbili zilizojengwa kule zimejengwa 
pahali ambapo ni pazuri, barabara inapitika vizuri na zimejengwa katika hali ambayo 
yapendeza lakini kupitia kwa yale ambayo tuli yoyaona pale hawakujenga kihalali zile 
nyumba zimejengwa bila mipangilio ya kuidhinishwa yaani approval plan  na kama serikali 
ya Kaunti ya Mombasa haikuidhinisha nyumba zile na tunasema k wamba ziko kiharamu na 
serikali ya Kaunti ya Mombasa kupitia Kamati y a Ardhi itapeleka notisi ya siku saba ya zile 
nyumba zivunjwe Mheshimiwa  Spika kwa sababu haziko kihalali kisheria. Ahsante 
Mheshimiwa Spika.  
 
The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Hon. Charles Kitula are you satisfied with 
the response?  
 
Chief Whip (Hon. Kitula ): Ahsante Mheshimiwa  Spika . Mheshimiwa Spika kusema 
kweli nilikuwa na Mwenyekiti pamoja na Naibu wake katika kata ndogo yangu ya Frere 
Town ninayo wakilisha na kusema kweli tuliweza kukaa na kuweza kuchunguza na tukaweza 
kugundua ya kweli nyumba zil e ni za tajiri fulani katika mtaa wangu lakini kama kiongozi 
lazima niongoze na kuweza kuacha legacy  katika eneo langu . Kwa hivyo jukumu la 
Mwenyekiti alilochukua kuwapatia siku saba ili waweze kuhakikisha kwamba wameondoa 
jengo lile au sisi kama serikali tuweze kuchukua jukumu . Kusema kweli Mheshimiwa Spika 
nimeridhika na majibu ya Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti.

Finance the status of loans for Hon. Members and staff of this Assembly and the same t ime 
the gratuity submission;  whether  they submitted  because we are not aware if they are being

The Deputy  Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes Hon. Hatimy , the Chairman Finance and 
Budget.  
 
Hon. Mohamed Hatimy : Mheshimiwa Spika, Mheshimiwa m wenzangu ameuliza 
swali la ku taka kujua juu ya mambo ya gratuity  na mikopo  nafikiri  hii ni N yumba ya sheria, 
na kuna sheria ambazo ni lazima sisi tuzifuate kuhusiana  na mambo haya . Nafikiri  sheria ya  
County Government A ct inaelezea vizuri sana ni nani an afaa kufanya nini, kusema hivi  
nafikiri Mheshimiwa Spika kama si kukosea ukiangalia section  12, 13, 14 inazungumza juu ya 
gratuity  ni chini ya wafanyi  kazi manake ni malipo ambayo yanalipwa baada ya kufanya ile 
kazi ulioandi kwa na naangalia mambo haya, mambo  ya welfare  yanaangaliwa na B odi. 
Pia tukiangalia nafikiri juzi tulikuwa na mwakilishi  wa B odi nafikiri aliweza kukaa na 
Waheshimiwa kuz ungumza na sijui mulifikia wapi  lakini naomba hili suala li elekezwe kwa 
Bodi ili wawe ze kujibu kwa sababu ukiangalia Kamati ina majukumu yake, Kamati 
majukumu yake wamemaliza, tumeleta sheria, tulipitisha sheria, tulifanya bajeti tukaweka 
pesa sasa ni Bodi iwe itatengeneza itafuata ile sheria ya kutuambia sisi kama washa teua zile 
Kamati ambazo zinatakikana ziweko na pi a washafanya mikakati ya kuweza kutengeneza 
pesa ili W aheshimiwa waweze kupata hizo pesa. Kwa hivyo Mheshimiwa Spika naomba 
Nyumba hii ikubaliane na mimi kuwa haya ni majukumu ya Bodi na Bodi ndio itaweza kuja 
kujibu haya masuala. Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika.
