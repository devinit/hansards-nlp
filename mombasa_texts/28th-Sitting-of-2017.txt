ukulima na ufugaji , nina matarajio makubwa kwake na tangia tu letewe barua na G avana 
amekusudia kumpa na fasi hii nimekuwa ni kimfuatilia ...nyanzo zake, majukumu yake mashinani 
na kwa uhakika iwapo ripoti hii ingesema kinyume na jinsi alivyo basi naona tungepingana 
lakin i kwa sababu  imemtambua alivyo na ku mpa nafasi hii , binafsi namuunga mkono na naomba 
Bunge hili likubaliane tum pe nafasi na tutarajie mabadiliko katika K aunti yetu ya Mombasa  
hususan tukizingatia kilimo kiko chini lakini tunaweza tukakuza kilimo cha baharini,  kilimo cha 
ufugaji wa samaki  na uvuvi kwa ujumla . Kwa hio niko pamoja na Ripoti hii na naunga mkono 
kuteuli wa kwa M heshimiwa Mwamtoa . Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika.  
 Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Ahsante , naam Mheshimiwa  Amur . 
 Hon. Murfad Amur:  Thank you Mr. Speaker Sir.  Mr. Speaker Sir for me also I want not 
to be left behind with my Members. Mr. Speaker Sir first I  want t o say to this Assembly and the 
members of the p ublic that His Excellency the Governor was a very wise man to elect a person 
who was against him during the election . This is one thing showing that the Governor ha s 
nothing to do with issues of p arties, but to bring all stakeholders together to serve the people of 
Mombasa ; this is congratulation s to His Excellency the Governor ... 
(Applause)  
 ...Mr. Speaker , it is not easy in our system s of government for a person who was in the 
opposition  side to be acc orded a position in any government in this Country of ours , it is not that 
easy, for that I want to congratulate His Excellency  the G overnor for choosing Mr. Mwamtoa 
Bakari Mwamtoa to be part of Mombasa people who will deliver services . The idea of Mwamtoa  
why he went to be a guber natorial Deputy G overnor with Mr. Hon. Awiti  is that he wanted  to 
serve the people of Mombasa. Th e mindset of Hassan Mwamtoa was to serve the people of 
Mombasa so he has been given that opportunity to serve the people of  Mombasa b y His 
Excellency the G overnor . So it is upon Mr. Mwamtoa to prove to the public and the County for 
the faith that the Governor has on him  Mr. Speaker , there are so many people who supported  the 
Governor but who  did not get this position . So for him, Mr. Sp eaker it is upon him now to prove  
to the people of Mombasa  that, the Governor has proved so it is upon him to prove  to the people 
of Mombasa that he will deliver to the mandate that he was given. Thank you , Mr. Speaker.  
 Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank yo u Hon. Amur, yes Hon. Mwalimu . 
 Hon. Mwalimu Mgwisho:  Ahsante sana Bwana Spika , natoa shukrani zangu za dhati 
kwa Mheshimiwa Bwana Gavana kwa kuweza kum teua Bwana  Mwamtoa katika nafasi hii ya 
Waziri  aliompatia. .. 
(Applause)  
 Nina hakika na nina imani  kwamb a Bwana Mwamtoa atafanya kazi hii kwa njia nzuri , 
Mwamtoa ni kijana ambaye amezaliwa  katika Wodi yangu na nin aamini kwamba atafanya kazi 
nzuri , kwa hio natoa shukrani zangu za dhati kwa Mheshimiwa Gavana  na pia nawaomba 
Wabunge wenzangu tuungane pamoja ili  tuweze kum uunga mkono  Bwana Mwamtoa na pia 
tumpatie njia na n guvu ya kufanya kazi yake kama W aziri. Ahsante sana Bwana Spika.

ESTA BLISHMENT OF PEOPLE’S ASSEMBLY  
Mr. Speaker Sir, I beg to move the following Motion ; 
AWARE that on 8th August , 2017 and 26th October , 2017 IEBC conducted illegal, 
unconstitutional and undemocratic presidential elections;  
RECOGNIZING  the fact that the turnou t of the presidential elections was 30 per cent or 
thereabouts of the total number of all registered voters in Kenya and therefore the  President 
cannot by delegation or otherwise, be properly vested with the people’s sovereign power s and 
authority;  
OBSERV ING  that the exercise of the executive authority by the President has in the past 
few years reintroduced the trappings of the imperial presidency and despotic tendencies in  the 
conduct of public affairs;  
             KNOWING  that Parliament has been legisl ating unconstitutional, illegal, undemocratic 
and draconian laws, and in particular laws that contrav ene the Bill of Rights and the principles 
for the electoral system; and , 
ACKNOWLEDGING the sovereign power s of the people of Kenya, the supremacy of the   
Constitution of Kenya , 2010 and the sovereign right , or authority of the people to determine the 
form of governance in Kenya.  
I therefore urge this Assembly to RESOLVE  that;

tumepata n a mimi ningependa kuunga mkono M swada huo kwa sababu naf ikiri mimi ni katika 
wa kwanza ambaye nakataa ule unyanyasaji unaotendeka sa a hii, kwetu sisi hususan  kwa vyama 
vya u pinzani na tukiwa kwenye upinzani na sisi tunataka haki na nina im ani kubwa ya kuwa leo 
tutapitisha M swada huo bila kupata ‘la’ hata moja na ya pili  ni masikitiko kidogo japo tulikuwa 
tuna mambo mengi k atika K aunti ya Mombasa lakini  ningekuwa ni  furaha kubwa tungeweza 
kuwa sisi ndio wa  kwanza kuipitisha katika Kaunti 47 za Kenya lakini afadhali kuchelewa kuliko 
kukosa kabisa . Kwa hi o naomba na naunga mkono M swada huo Mheshimiwa Spika na nina 
imani kubwa sisi kama wana ODM na watu wa Mombasa tutap itisha  huo M swada moja kwa 
moja bila pingamizi , ahsanteni  sana. 
Mr. Speaker  (Hon.  Khatri) : Thank you; yes Hon.  Robert Nyiro . I can see you are having 
a constitution there so kindly give us your opinions . 
Hon.  Mwaega : Thank you Mr. Speaker your eyes are not  playing you a ny trick , and yes 
I have the constitution in my hand and it is the guiding li ght to the discussion we are havin g 
today and I want to refer to Chapter one and read through . Chapter one of this C onstitution talks 
about the sovereignty of the pe ople, that all the sovereign power belongs to the people and it can 
only be exe rcised in accordance with this C onstitution . This same C onstitution also says that the 
people can also exercise its power directly or can elect to lease this power either to the  elected 
leaders , independent institutions like the IEBC and many other institutions but they are just 
acting  on borrowed authority . I therefor e find it very prudent and very essential  that whenever 
there is a trick that somebody wants to play with this co nstitution it is always good and b est that 
we take back the power s to the people and maybe to make it more clearer by taking the power s 
and author ity to the people does not mean that we  dissolve  this Assembly because this A ssembly 
is legally constituted bu t by taking the p ower  back to the people it is a way of fi ghting  the 
illegalities that are being exercised by those people who think  they are go ing to ascend to p ower  
through the back door . So I want to urge the people of Mombasa to join the rest of the c ountry in 
embracing the People’s Assembly and therefore rejecting the computer generated leadership that 
we have in this country by having our own voice and because  we have a Government down here, 
it is good that the people of Mombasa are going to be in co nsultation with their Government and 
the Assembly of Mombasa and the People’s Assembly outside there so that we can together 
deliberate on our issues and refuse the kingdom that people are mak ing on us.  
So I stand to support and remind the people of Kenya and Mombasa that whoever is 
saying that he is the President today  can never be the President if t he people want their power 
back. S o today we are telling the people of Mombasa that you have the authority to exercise your 
rights and put a voice and we the A ssembly of Mombasa is there to make sure that whatever the 
people of Mombasa tell us is whatever we shall follow but not otherwise .  
December 6, 2017               MOMBASA COUNTY ASSEMBLY DE BATES                            28 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information

channeled  so that we have the Peopl e’s Assembly realized in Mombasa County , with these few 
remarks I beg to support.  
 Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you, yes Hon. Lucy Chizi . 
 Hon. (Ms.)  Chireri: Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa Spika k wa kunipa fursa hii.  
Mheshimiwa Spika mimi nauunga mkono hoja  hii mia fil mia hata nashangaa ni k wa nini 
tunaizungumzia hoja hii. H oja hii Mheshimiwa Spika ilikuwako tuipitishe moja kwa moja.  
Mheshimiwa Spika wakati umefika wa sisi Wak enya tujikomboe katika hawa mabeberu , 
wametunyanyasa kwa muda mrefu;  ni hali ya ku huzunisha sana katika serikali yetu ya Kenya 
kuwe tunapata uongozi wa lazima, ni lazima mtu awe kiongozi hata kama mwananchi 
hakumkubali . Mheshimiwa Spika tunasema haiwe zekani hata kidogo, hata viweje … 
(Applause ) 
 …Sisi kama Bunge letu la Kaunti ya Mombasa  Mheshimiwa Spika tunasema enough is 
enough , ni lazima tukomboe watu wetu katika jarida lile ambalo linatupotosha. Mheshimiwa 
Spika nitaenda kwa  uamuzi  ambao tumeweka kama sisi Bunge la Kaunti  katika  kitengo cha (d) 
ambayo inasema …  
(Hon . (Ms.) Chireri) re ad) 
 A truly Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission be established with a view 
of holding a fresh Presidential election on or before 9th February , 2018;  
(Applause ) 
 Mheshimiwa Spika nataka haya matakwa yetu yaheshimiwe na ikiwezekana ni lazima 
uchaguzi wa U raisi u regelewe haraka iwezekanavyo…  
(Applause ) 
 …Mheshimiwa Spika tumechaguliwa na wananchi, na wananchi wanatutegemea sisi 
kama wakombozi wao, leo hi i tusipopitisha hii H oja hakuna lolote ambalo mwananchi atasema 
nimemtuma Mheshimiwa Lucy kuto ka W odi ya Mtopanga ameenda ametu wakilisha ama 
anatubwaga? Hatutabwaga wananchi wetu, tuko pamoja na wananchi wetu liwalo na liwe, jua 
litoke huku , liende huku lakini ni lazima turegele e uchaguzi wa Uraisi. Mheshimiwa Spika 
tunapenda watu wetu na ni lazima  tuwaonyeshe yale mapenzi ambayo tuko nayo kwa watu wetu, 
tumeteseka kwa muda mrefu hata hayasemeki mengine lakini itabidi tuyazungumze hivyo hivyo. 
Kuna mfumo Mheshimiwa Spika mara unasikia kuna watu wana vyama hivi, watu wengine kuna 
vyama hivi ni sababu  ukombozi haujafika, lakini ukombozi ukifika Mheshimiwa Spika hatutaona 
watu sijui kuna MRC, sijui kuna vyama gani. Vile vyama kama kutakuwa na jambo ambalo 
mwananchi amelikubali kama mwananchi na yale matatizo yake yamekubalika na yametatuliwa 
hatutakuwa na mvurugan o katika serikali yetu ya Kenya.  Serikali yetu ya Kenya inaingia mahali 
pabaya kwa sababu haki haijatendeka, kwa hio Mheshimiwa Spika ninaunga mkono hoja hii 
nikitarajia haki itatendeka. Ahsante sana.  
 Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Ahsante Mheshimi wa Lucy Chizi. Naam  Hon. Leila  
Nyache . 
 Hon. (Ms.)  Nyache:  Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa Spika kwa kuweza kunipa fursa hii ya 
kuweza kuchangia. Mimi pia kwa upande wangu nau nga mkono hili Bunge la Wananchi, sababu 
yangu ya kwanza ya kuunga mkono hili Bunge la Wa nanchi ama tuwe kama Wapwani ni 
kwamba kuanzia tuanze kupiga kura mwaka 2007, 2013 mpaka 2017 kura zetu zinaibiwa kama 
wana NASA…  
(Applause ) 
 Na kuanzia hi o mihula yote ni sisi ndio tulikuwa tunapita Mheshimiwa Spika, tunapita 
na tunaibiwa tukiona . 
December 6, 2017               MOMBASA COUNTY ASSEMBLY DE BATES                            28 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 11  Kama hi i ya juzi tuliibiwa kweupe tukiona hii ya tarehe 26/10/2017 maana yake vituo 
vilikuwa havina watu Mheshimiwa  Spika , vituo vilikuwa vitupu kabisa hata hizo kura zengine 
walifanya kujiongezea tuu, sisi tuna uhakika kuwa watu wetu tuliwakanya na hawakuenda 
kupiga kura kama vile Baba alivyosema, kwa hio sisi tuna uchungu sana…  
(Applause ) 
 Tuko na uchungu sana Mheshimiwa Spika , kama kina mama tunatoa watu kwa wingi 
kwenda kupiga kura halafu mwisho wa kwisha sisi tunakua na imani sisi ndio washindi 
tunaambiwa sis i ndio tumeshindwa!  Kwa  hio hilo jambo pia ni sababu kubwa ya kuweza kuamua 
kuunga mkono hili Bunge la Wananchi. Pia kwa upande mwengine Mheshimiwa Spika 
ningependa kuongezea pia rasilmali zetu za huk u Pwani Mheshimiwa hatuna faida nazo, hasa 
Bandari yetu ya hapa Pwan i hatufaidiki nayo, sisi kama Wap wani ama kama wa Kenya wa hapa 
Pwani tunasema asilimia 80 ya watu wanaoandikwa kazi pale Bandarini ni watu kutoka sehemu 
za huko juu na sisi tunasema tungependa ikiwa hiyo asilimia 80 itabadilika iwe ni watoto w a 
Pwani  waweze kufaidika na hii rasil mali yao ambayo ni Bandari y a hapa kwetu Mombasa 
ingekuwa vizuri sana lakini hatuna sauti Mheshimiwa Spika…  
(Applause ) 
 …tumekanyagiwa vibaya sana.  Gavana wetu amekanyagiwa vibaya sana ki la mtu 
anajua, hana sauti kama k iongozi na sisi tunamheshimu tunajua yeye ndio k iongozi wetu ambae 
anaweza kusaidia hii Mombasa lakini amekanyagiwa hana sauti h ata ya kumiliki rasil mali 
zilizoko Pwani na yeye ni Gavana Mombasa County 001 . Kwa hio pia mamlaka yamepungua 
upande huo pia, tu nahitaji pia mamlaka yetu na sisi tupewe  na Gavana wetu pia apewe mamlaka 
aweze kuandika watu kule Bandarini , apewe  nafasi za kutosha hizo  asilimia  80 apatiwe. 
Mheshimiwa Spika nikimalizia ningeomba Bunge hili Waheshimiwa wenzangu wote hili Bunge 
letu la Kaunti ya Mombasa tuweze kuunga mkono huu M swada wa Bunge la Wananchi kupitia 
Katiba kipengele cha kwanza, tuunge mkono na itatuwezesha kuweza kujivunia kama W apwani 
na pia kumiliki rasil mali zetu wenyewe. Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa Spika.  
(Applause ) 
 Mr. Spea ker (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you. Yes Hon. Ibrahim Omondi Bomoa . 
 Hon.  Omondi:  Thank you Mr. Speaker Sir for having caught my eyes this particular 
time, also to make my contribution towards this beautiful and wonderful Motion today. I stand 
firm before this Ho use to say that I am one of the most NASA crusader s in this country…  
(Applause ) 
 And you cannot expect me to oppose this Motion for the first place.  
(Laughter and Applause ) 
 …So before I even make my contribution, I have already supported the Motion, but I  
want also to support this Motion with reasons so that it may not be taken otherwise.  
1. Article 1 of our Constitution states very clear ly that the sovereignty power belongs to the 
people of Kenya and this power that they have, I want those people who are op posing this 
Motion to clearly listen to m e, and this power belongs to these  people and they can give it out 
willingly , meaning that the people of Kenya can still refuse to give out this power, they can 
remain with it. So, when we are passing this Motion we  are simply giving back the power 
where it belongs…  
(Applause ) 
 …And nobody, not anybody in this country who has the power to criticize this because 
it is clearly entrenched  in our Constitution.   
 
December 6, 2017               MOMBASA COUNTY ASSEMBLY DE BATES                            28 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 12 2. The Constitution states very clear ly that the turn out, the  unconstitutional ly reconst ituted  
Government cannot be able to take over the power , and when I say unconstitutional ly 
reconstituted Government what I mean is this Mr. Speaker Sir, we had elections just a month 
ago and everybody in  this country saw what hap pened;  only 30  per cent  of the people of 
Kenya turned out to elect a President , 70 per cent  did not even turn up, they did not even 
make an attempt to go and vote….  
(Applause ) 
And today we are saying that we have the President who is going to be our Presid ent, that 
means it has been unconstitutional ly reconst ituted  so it unlawful itself…  
(Applause ) 
   I want also to state this categorically, as I support this Motion that such a constitution, such 
organ or body of the Presidency cannot be delegated, you cann ot delegate the people’s 
sovereign ty, power and authority, we cannot give that particular President that power because he 
lacks the threshold of the Constitution when you look at the turn out. Mr. Speaker Sir, I want 
also to say this, the People’s Assembly  is very superior to anybody in t his country, it is the 
superior , People’s Assembly it is not an organ, it is not just an organ which can be criticized by 
anybody, it cannot be criticized , it is not National Assembly, it is not Senate, it is not County 
Assembly…  
(Laughter ) 
 …it is not an organ Mr. Speaker Sir, I do not see why pe ople are not getting this point;  it is 
the people power who are now expressing their own power, the power that they have Mr. 
Speaker Sir. Mr. Speaker Sir I want also to say this, th is very People’s Assembly that some 
people are now trying to mud sling it , this very People’s Assembly the one that we are talking 
about it today, look at its agenda, look at what it is going to do to our country before we criticize 
it, it is going to give  the opportunity to the people of Kenya to express themselves willingly, 
engage their problems willingly without…  
(Applause ) 
 …going to a certain organ or a certain Constitution or a certain person and that is the 
best of them all. Somebody somewhere is sa ying this one is unconstitutional . Mr. Speaker Sir, 
briefly allow me just to state some of agendas of this People’s Assembly. One of them is to look 
at the people institutions  of the state, the state institutions, the institutions that have been formed 
by the people, look at the IEBC itself , if this People’s Assembly is going to be const ituted  look at 
the IEBC the way it is playing with the minds of Kenyans. Today the Chairman of the IEBC says 
the election will not be free and fair, tomorrow the Chairman of  the IEBC tells us that this 
election will be free and fair. Who is be ing played with in this case? That is very serious Mr. 
Speaker Sir and that is why when we enact this People’s Assembly it is going to correct all th ose 
and that is one of the agenda ’s; the security organ in our co untry, that is one of the agenda of th is 
People’s Assembly, look at the security organ, look  at the way our people are beate n, they are 
tear-gassed  dying everywhere…  
(Applause ) 
 …Simply because the security organ is in the hands  of an individual , who can say go 
and deal with him and they go directly without looking at even the disadvantages and 
advantages . We are all human beings and we are all entitled to life Mr. Speaker Sir, so if our 
security organ s are being misused like thi s and the People’s Assembly is going to look into that 
so that we can devolve our own security organ s, so we have Governor Joho , our  Governor Joho 
saying that he is the one to control  the security in M ombasa County . 
December 6, 2017               MOMBASA COUNTY ASSEMBLY DE BATES                            28 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 13  That is th e best for us Mr. S peaker  Sir; I do not know why somebody somewhere 
should say that this Motion …, it should be the first Motion to pass in this country before any  
other Motion. I want to wind up Mr. Speaker Sir, this very People’s Assembly … this Motion that 
we are discussing today i s going also to look at the Govern ance issues whereby today Hon. 
Maimuna your vote does not count, you will go and vote , after voting somebody else has been 
done (??)  But one of the agenda of the People’s Assembly is t o ensure that your votes counts.  I 
do not know who is opposing this Constitution  maybe he has a problem, everyone ’s vote counts 
so it is going to  look at the governance of this . 
 So as I wind up Mr. Speaker Sir, I  just want to say the following; j ust some three 
months ago I f ell a victim of th is Constitution ; as I speak, I am speaking from experience, I was 
ousted from my house as a fly, more than 30 security officers Mr. Speaker Sir, look at my 
weight ... 
(Laughter ) 
 Less than 15kgs being ousted by more than 30 police officers with 20 trucks , Mr. 
Speaker Sir , and  armed with eeh …  
(Laughter ) 
 …Mr. Speaker Sir surely, finally, you know there is a saying that says as I wind up that , 
a mourner cannot pretend to move into the homestea d where people are mourning and pretend 
to yell out loudly more tha n the bereaved , they do not know that it is us who are being hit 
because they do not. Thank you Mr. Speaker Sir. I support 100  per cent  this Motion .  
(Applause ) 
 Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you very much Hon. Ibrahim Oyugi Omondi, thank 
you. Yes, Hon.  Mwaka . 
 Hon. ( Ms.) Mwaka  Mulundonda:  Ahsante sana Bwana Spika nashukuru sana kwa 
kunipa fursa hii ingawaje Hon. Bomoa ametu bomoa kabisa , amemaliza mambo yote . Mimi 
kama Mheshimiwa Mwaka ninaunga M swada huu mko no mia fil mia kwa sababu kule

 Kwa hio kwa niaba ya wananchi wa Wodi ya Timbwani nimewasikia na  nimekubaliana

kwenye Bunge hili najua wote tunaunga mkono Mswada  huu pia ninaona muda unaenda ni

hoja hi i. Ahsante Bwana Spika.  
 Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you . Yes, Hon. Fadhili Mwalimu Makarani, Deputy 
Speaker . 
 Deputy Spea ker (Hon. Fadhili M walimu ): Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa Spika, mimi pia 
nachukua furs a hii kuunga mkono hoja hii iliyo mbele yetu siku ya leo. Mheshimiwa Spika kama 
waliotangulia wenzangu kuchangia, Article 1 ya Katiba yetu inaonyesha nguvu za mwananchi 
ziko w api na inaonyesha wazi kwamba mwananchi ana uwezo wa kuchagua aje awakil ishwe 
katika M abunge kama haya na vile vile mwananchi ana uwezo wa kuchukua jukumu la 
kujiwakilisha mwenyewe . Mheshim iwa Spika ndio maana sisi kama W abunge wa Bunge la 
Kaunti ya Mombas a tunaunga mkono hoja hii ilioko mbele yetu tukielewa ya kwamba ni hoja 
ambayo itasaidia nchi yetu na ni hoja ambayo itasaidia wananchi wetu vilivyo. Mheshimiwa 
Spika tunaelewa Bunge la Mwananchi litaweza kurekebisha mambo mengi am bayo kwa sasa 
hivi yameha ribika .  
December 6, 2017               MOMBASA COUNTY ASSEMBLY DE BATES                            28 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 14  Naunga mkono kuwa kura ambazo zilipigwa tarehe 8 kwanza kukawa na wale ambao 
walikuja kuangalia kura zile kutoka bara Ulaya  walipitia njia ya nyuma kujaribu kuonyesha 
kuwa zilikuwa ni kura za haki , lakini twashukuru kwa msema kweli korti yetu ikaony esha kuwa 
hazikuwa kura za haki. Mheshimiwa Spika kura za juzi zilizofanywa Mwezi wa Oktoba pia vile 
vile ni dhihirisho wazi kuwa zilikuwa ni kura ambazo zimeibiwa, kura ambazo hazikuwa 
matakwa ya wananchi walivyotaka maana ilionyesha wazi waliojitokeza w alikuwa ni wachache 
na tu liobaki nyuma tulikuwa ni wengi , ni haki sauti yetu sisi wengi ambao twafanywa ndio 
wanyonge imefika wakati kuwa sauti yetu sisi wanyonge pia iweze kusikika Mheshimiwa Spika.   
(Applause)  
Mheshimiwa Spika wana historia  watakwambia ha ta nchi ambayo ina nguvu , super 
power , nchi kama Marekani wale weusi wa pale walianza kuruhusiwa kupiga kura mwaka 
ambao sisi Kenya ilikuwa tushapata uhuru lakini hawakuanza hivi hivi tu mpaka kuruhusiwa 
wao kupiga kura walisimama  kama sisi tunavyotaka kus imama; walienda na M abunge haya ya 
wananchi , walisusia vile walivyosusia, kususia kisiasa na kususia kiuchumi na ndivyo ambavyo 
Bunge letu la Mwananchi twataka tulipeleke na iko kabisa katika Katiba yetu ikituelezea nguvu 
za mwananchi zitaendeshwa ki  namna  gani?  Mheshimiwa Spika nguvu za mwananchi 
zitaendeshwa katika upeo wa serikali kuu na upeo  wa serikali hizi za mashinani. K wa kweli 
Mheshimiwa Spika Kenya ilipata uhuru tukitumia Katiba ambayo ilikuwa na majimbo lakini hivi 
sasa tunakoelekea hizi serikali  za ugatuzi ziko katika hali ya kukata roho na lau tutaruhusu 
serikali ya ube pari, serikali ambayo imeingia mamlakani kinyume cha sheria iweze kuendelea 
itafanya yale ambayo yalifanywa miaka ya nyuma, miaka ya 60 kuweza kuondoa serikali hizi 
lazima tusimam e sisi pamo ja na wananchi wetu, pamoja na M abunge yetu ambayo itakuwa 
tumeweza kuyapitisha kuhakikisha kuwa tumetetea Katiba yetu .  
Mheshimiwa Spika tumeona katika hoja ambayo iko mbele imeeleza wazi kuwa inataka 
kufany wa marekebisho kwa upande wa usalama ; kama alivyozungumza mwenzetu mmoja akiwa 
yeye ni mmoja kati ka ya wale ambao ni waathiriwa.  Tunaona Mheshimiwa Spika Gavana 
anadhalilishwa ; leo hii Gavana anaweza kuja kushikwa asumbuliwa kama ambaye ni mtu duni 
hana thamani . Mheshimiwa  Spika ni lazima tus imame kama Wabunge wa M abun ge ya Kaunti 
tukishirikiana na M abunge ya wananchi maana twaelewa ya kwamba mipangilio kabambe 
itaendelea ku pangwa kuonyesha ni jinsi gani W abunge wa Mabunge waliochaguliwa hapa 
pamoja na wananchi wenyewe wenye nguvu tut aweza kus hirikiana kuhakikisha M abunge haya 
yamefanya kazi na katika hoja hii pia imetuonyesha kama alivyozungumza ndugu yangu 
aliyetangulia ni jinsi gani tutaweza kurekebisha Commission  kama hii inayosimamia uchaguzi . 
Amezungumzia kwa kina kabisa na iko haja kweli  kufanya marekebisho katika tume ya uchaguzi 
maana imetudhalilisha miaka mingi, n a Mheshimiwa Spika itafika wakati hata zile pesa ambazo 
tunazochukua huku kwetu chini mashinani tutazisimamisha zibakie huku chini mashinani … 
(Applause)  
...Tuwaangalie wao huk o juu Mheshimiwa Spika watafanya kazi kinamna gani? Maana

malengo yetu y atafaulu na mwisho wa mwisho ni kwamba tunataka kura yako iweze kuhesabika, 
tunataka kura yangu iweze kuhesabika. Tumesema tumechoka na Mheshimiwa Spika punda

Spika.  
Mr. Speaker  (Hon.  Khatri) : Ahsante sana , naam  Hon.  Tobias Otieno Samba . 
Hon.  Samba:  Yes thank you Mr. Speak er Sir finally you have seen me , I have struggle d 
standing and I was almost giving up thank you for seeing that. First of all let me start by 
appreciating the fact that the initiator of the Motion  Hon.  Aran came up with the Motion  and 
number two let me  also thank the Motion  Mover , our Majority Leader Hon.  Mwidani. First of 
all, Hon.  Speaker there are so many reasons why we are now running to form the People's 
Assembly, we didn't just wake up and c ame up with the idea . Mr. Speaker Sir the historical 
injustic es that were suppo sed to be looked into by the Kr egler report hasn't been tackled yet and 
whatever thing that is happening now is getting worse and if things are not checked we might 
end up not having a country because if it comes to a state where by we ar e almost having two 
President s I think you can see that we are not heading somewhere that is good.   
Mr. Speaker Sir allow me to express myself that outside there to the public what i have 
read as the resolutions that we have resolved is the same language th at wananchi  are also 
speaking outside there. W hat we are advocating we just advocate for reforms Mr. Speaker Sir , 
when we participate in an election we expect free, fair and credibility of the same . We wonder 
where  it has reach ed a point where compu ters ar e now generating leaders;  they have started by 
presidential levels they will come to gubernatorial level, they will come down to even our level 
and let me assure Hon.  Members  here when it comes to our level let me tell you suppose they 
could have interfere d with us this House  could have been full of Jubilee but that could have not 
been the interest of the people of Mombasa so the earlier we tackle that the better for us all.  
We support the Motion  fully and when I flash back, when the killings occur and it has 
been confirmed that the police are doing the same and you see whoever is suppose d to be 
responsible will come up on public television to state that those killed are wakoras . Mr. Speaker 
Sir I f ail to understand how and when baby Pendo turn ed to be a mkora; when we were just 
about to go to an election ; three days or four days to Mr. M usando was killed and we know the 
critical position Mr. M usando h eld by then. Mr. Speaker Sir when we are coming with this 
People's Assembly it is not that we want to form o ur own go vernment, it's that we are tired;  we 
have  seen on several occasions our G overnor and let me tell the House  or assure the House  if a 
whole P resident can s tate categorically o n national television that I will just quote him , Mr. 
Speaker Sir allow me  to quote Mr. President that , hao wakora nitapambana nao  and then we are 
heading to another election even Chief Justice had no any other wise but to uphold the election 
because he was already promised that he will be dealt with and that is where we are head ing to, 
he will start with the Chief J ustice, he will  come to the lawyers and all these  petitions will go in 
their favor . Mr. Speaker Sir my request and my appeal to this House  is that let us adopt the 
Motion  to avoid so many things ; the resolutions are go od and we could have pass ed this Motion  
as early as before it was initiated before but I am happy and you can see the mood of the country 
any other day we have never ha d visitors like the way they are here, they are here because the 
Motion  affect s them di rectly and we are not working out of the Constitution…

...We are in order , Chapter one of the C onstitution  states that  the sovereignty belongs to 
the people and that is what we are advocating for and Mr. Speaker Sir as we will come out of this 
Hon. House  some of us will start being follow ed; last time it was Hon.  Bomoa and when he was 
so much emotional  he had some reasons because they have the tendency  when they come for you 
they will come with 60 trucks and over 100 men , fully armed and that's w hy when Al Shabaab  
kills our policemen instead of us sympath izing with them  you find out now public are 
celebrating … 
(Applause)  
...Where are we heading to? When  it comes to a point when one of our own is killed you 
will hear people saying that this Al Shab aab they could have ma de it 20 or 100 but the y only 
killed one police officer. Mr. Speaker Sir we want to delegate the power to the people, we are 
going to work closely with the people and I beg to support the Motion . Thank you Mr. Speaker 
Sir. 
(Applause)  
Mr. Speaker  (Hon.  Khatri) : Thank you very much.  Hon.  Members  I just want to assure 
you that all of you will have a chance to contribute to this Motion  and pass it so please bear with 
me everyone will have a chance to contribute. Thank you. Yes Hon.  Aran?  
Hon. Oindo : Finally, t hank you Mr. Speaker Sir , I was quite disturbed because you were 
not seeing me and I represent the youth of Mombasa County and when I speak, I speak on their 
behalf and thank you for giving me this chance. Mr. Speaker Sir it is only in  Kenya where you 
will see or hear from just a mere resident of Gatundu appreciating the policemen for the good 
work while the real president of the people is really complaining . So what we are saying as the 
residents of Mombasa, as Hon.  Members  Mr. Speaker  Sir we don't recognize the leadership of 
one Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta , the resident of Gatundu …  
(Applause)  
And one Mr. Samuel Ruto ; the resident of Sarigoi , something like that I don't know 
where he is coming from … 
(Applause and Laughter)  
...The only person we  recognize as the President of the People, the only person  that was 
elected by more than eight million  votes ; Mr. Speaker Sir mark my words legitimate Kenyans , 
not computer generated votes is none other than , let me quote one activist is inside here called  
Baraka Juma he normally says none other than the worldness, his thunderness, his peckness, his 
babaness , his awesomeness, his worldness, his Kenyaness, Baba  Winnie, Baba Fidel, Baba 
Hassan Joho and Baba  Civilizer … 
(Applause)  
...Raila Amolo  Odinga!  Mr. Spe aker Sir you can read the mood of the Nation there's 
nothing to speculate, it has come a time where we have to take the power to the people and it has 
come a time where we will have to do it if they don't allow us to do and the youth s of this Nation 
will l ead by example, it is the time that we are taking the power that it is well articulated in the 
constitution to the people and that's the People's Assembly.  Mr. Speaker Sir we hereby give 
notice we know like Hon.  Samba said that they will get out here and t hey will start coming for us 
one by one and if I might quote one of the Member s once said that if they want to come for us I 
wonder when they you finish 30 million  supporters or 40 million  Kenyans who are in support of 
Raila Amolo Odinga. T hey will threaten  us, they might even kill some of us but the spirits will 
live on and we would not relax until we achieve what we want and Mr. Speaker Sir we know that 
on 12th Baba  Raila will become the 5th President of this Nation …

And you know now they are sc ared, they are worried because they keep guessing where 
Baba  will be sworn in , my friend if you are guessing keep guessing Baba  will be sworn in , in all 
the 47 C ounties and we will attend … 
(Applause)  
And Mr. Speaker Sir the delegation is about to leave we will go and witness the swearing 
in of the People's President and I urge you Hon.  Members  this is the time to stand by the Coast 
people, this is the time to stand by Kenyans, we've been oppressed, we've been winning the 
election and they ar e telling us wai t for next time. W e won the election 2007 we kept quiet, we 
won the election in 2013 we assumed, we won the election in the just concluded election in 
August and now they are telling us ngojeni , if I can just quote them ngojeni 2022 ! We are not 
stupid Mr. Speaker Sir and who said that it ’s only two... and mark my word and let me not be 
quoted wrongly who said that it ’s only two tribes that can lead this Nation Mr. Speaker Sir.  We 
have the likes of mighty Sultan Hassan Joho who ha ve vast knowledge and experie nce and he 
has a big heart to le ad this Nation and you are telling us to wait till 2032 and now if you are keen 
enough Mr. Speaker  now you can seem them  they are grooming their sons ; one called Jomo who 
cannot even articulate issues they have to write  and then he has to read that and now there's one 
that is called Nicholas Ruto . My friend we are here and we are really ready for leadership, we are 
saying if they cannot allow us to lead this Nation , if they keep stealing our elections and keep 
telling us that  we wait for 2022 we won't wait, we are taking the power to the people and the 
people will lead by example , and we will see the likes of Hon.  Hassan Ali Joho and he will be 
the P resident and we will follow .  
Mr. Speaker I urge this House , as a youth repres entative you can see they are here , I urge 
this House  please Hon.  Members  let's pass this Motion  and act on it accordingly. I rest my case , 
thank you Mr. Speaker Sir.  
(Applause)  
Mr. Speaker  (Hon.  Khatri) : Thank you , yes Hon.  Ramla . 
Hon.  (Ms.) Ramla Said:  Ahsante Bwana Spika mimi nasimama kui unga mkono  hii hoja 
ya People's Assembly  kwa sababu mimi kama Kiongozi wa walemavu wa ODM na NASA 
tumepitia mengi … 
(Applause)  
Na nina uchungu sana kutwaa walemavu majumbani kwenda kupiga kura kwa viongozi 
ambao wana iman i watabadilisha maisha  yao kuwa mazuri kisha leo hii uone mambo wanaiba 
kura huwa yatia uchungu sana kwa sababu wale walemavu wanatoka kwa tabu  kuja kupiga kura 
kwa imani ya kupata viongozi ambao wanawapenda wao …kwa imani wapate viongozi ambao 
wanataka wao , na huyo kiongozi ni Raila Amolo  Odinga … 
(Applause ) 
Na kwa masikitiko mengi tukaona tumeibiwa kwa hatua kubwa sana kwa mambo ya 
computer ; pili uchumi, uchumi uko juu sana na walemavu wengi sana hali zao ni duni, 
sizungumz ii kuhusu mlemavu peke yake na fam ilia zao hua ni tabu sana kuendeleza maisha, 
wachache s ana ndio wanapata maisha mazuri. K wa hio kwa  hayo machache mimi naunga huu 
Mswada na naomba tu upitishe … 
(Applause ) 
Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you . Yes Hon.  Feddis  Salame Mbura . 
Hon. (Ms.) Mbura:  Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika, mimi kwanza naunga mkon o hoja hii

DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information

Wananchi ili tuweze kupeana nguvu kwa jamii , wakati tutapeana nguvu kwa jamii basi tuju e 
tutakomboa nchi yetu ya Kenya . Mwisho ombi langu ni kwamba tukaweze kuun da mak undi 
kuanzia mashinani kuwe na B unge la Wananchi na tukajenge uwezo ili wakat i wanaposimama 
wakidai haki zao wawe wana uwezo na nguvu za kuweza kudai haki zao na kutoa h izi mamlaka 
kutoka kwa mtu mmoja mwenye kutaka kutawala nchi kwa miaka yote . Kwa  hio naunga mkono 
mia kwa mia tukaweze kuunga mkono , ahsanteni . 
Mr. Speaker  (Hon. K hatri) : Thank you . Yes Hon.  Prischillah  Mumba . 
Hon.  (Mrs.) Mumba:  Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika, nafikiri  niliamua kukaa wakati 
ulisema  kila mtu atachangia hii hoja ndio nikajis ikia uhuru nikae mpaka nitakapofikiwa , kwa hio 
nakuheshimu na  ninashukuru kwa kunipa f ursa hii. M imi kama Mheshimiwa  kutoka Shimanzi , 
Ganjoni nimes imama kuunga mkono hoja hii ya B unge  la Wananchi na nikinukuu hili Bunge la 
wananchi limekuwa likitusaidia sana katika kuangazia mambo mengi  wakati tulikuwa 
tukiangalia haya M abunge yakichangia hata ukiangalia katika runinga saa nyengine hua 
yanaletwa yakiangazia mambo mbali mbali ambayo yana yofanyika kwa B unge kuu, na 
wamekuwa wakitoa t aka W aheshimiwa wengi sana kwa ajili kuna mambo yalikuwa mengine 
yanafanyika na yanatupita lakini ukiyasikia unaanza kuju a kuna kitu ambacho si cha sawa na 
wewe uweze kuchangia , ikiwa wakati huo tayari walikuwa wanafanya shughuli  zao na tunaona 
vile walivyokuwa wana saidia na  leo ikiwa tumewapitisha katika Bunge lao liwe halali na 
kuweza kusaidia tuweze kuona matokeo ambayo t umekuwa sisi hatuyaoni karibu miongo mitatu 
sasa ama miwili kwa sababu mamlaka yamekuwa yakienda katika jamii fulani kwa sababu ya 
kuwa wanahesabu kuwa wao wana uwingi wa hesabu na hali tunajua Keny a saa hizi kama si 
makabila 43  pengine  ni 44 maana kila kukicha wa naongeza makabila ya kubuni na hali katika 
uongozi hawayapi.  Juzi wametuongezea kabila hapa M akonde ili waongeze katika hesabu na hali 
hatujajua siku  zote hizo toka wakati wa enzi za Raisi wa kwanza W amakonde walikuwa 
hawako ? Si wali kuwako na mbona hawakup ewa vitambulisho , mbona wapewe sasa kwa sababu 
kuna idadi inatakikana ?  
Hilo ni jambo limekuwa likituona sisi t ukidhalilishwa ndio maan a Wapwani tunasimama 
kidete kusema hatukubali ani na huu uongozi ul ioko tukaja wengine wakatumia u rongo 
wakutupatia hati milik i za mashamba  utakuta umepewa nafasi ya choo na umepewa hati miliki 
ya shamba  mbele za watu na unaambiwa ni hati miliki ya shamba . Tunashangaa na miujiza 
inayofanyika na hii serikali ambayo sisi hatuitambui, na mimi nikisimama hapa kama Mbunge  
Mwakilishi wa W odi yangu nina sababu ya kusimama kidete na kumsifu baba kwa mambo 
ambayo mimi na weza sema nimes ikia kwa sababu ukiunga mkono mtu ni lazima una sababu na 
ukiunga mkono kiongozi ni lazima una sababu hauungi tu kwa sababu unaunga mkono . Wakati 
baba alipotu ambia kuhusu mambo ya NYS tuliambiwa ni urongo , anaingilia serikali,  mimi 
nikakaa na wenzangu nikauliza haya mambo ya Anne Waiguru ni kweli? Nikaambiwa katika 
vikao vya mitaani , mama wacha tukuam bie ukweli leo  baba akikwambia una mimba una 
mimba … 
(Laughter ) 
Na baba aki nyooshea kidole bibi yako W aheshimiwa bibi yako hapa kuwa ana  mimba jua 
bibi yako ana mimba mimi  nakwambia … 
(Laughter)  
Baada ya miezi mitatu utaiona, maana  hua ni mtu yuko  na hekima atanukuliwa ana 
uwongo lakini mwisho wa kwisha NYS tuliona magunia ya kitolewa benki, haikuaminika ! Na 
yakaonekana hiyo ni kashfa ya  serikali, ikaja mambo ya  Eurobond  nikauliza sasa hii Eurobond  
ni nini  tena?  Mwenyekiti, baba ashalipua mengine , Eurobond  ni nini?

ilitoka haikutoka ? Tukarudi  hapo hapo  tena, tulipokuwa sisi tunajua baba alipokuwa  katika 
serikali alipokuwa Waziri Mkuu  baba huyu alitutengezea barabara ya kutoka Kaloleni , 
akaianzisha Kaloleni  ipasue mpaka Kilifi  matapeli walipoingia ikimalizika Kilifi  wao ndio 
wakaenda kuifungua . SGR baba akajua hapa watu wanatakikana wasafirish we akatengeneza 
vizuri akiwa na R aisi mstaafu na wakatenge neza hesabu  nzuri matapeli walipoingia wakai futilia 
mbali  waka weka mambo mengine ikaonge zwa mara kumi , ilipokuja k utoka huku  chini  ikawa ni 
ukweli imepi gwa mara mbili , na mara tatu . Sasa mimi nitamuamini vipi R aisi amba e kila 
kukicha kwazuka mambo na yakiisha mwezi wa tisa mimba yazaliwa , maanake kila ikitungwa 
mimba ya u rongo ukweli mwisho wadhihirika . Sasa mimi nikiwa ambia nina imani na baba haya 
ndio mambo yametakasa haya macho yangu na m asikio ndio s asa niko hapa kusema hi li Bung e 
la Wananchi na nipewe nguvu hivi wanipe R aisi wangu mimi … 
(Applause ) 
Maana nikiwa mimi peke yangu u rongo nitakuwa nina kazi ngumu lakini nataka 
niregeshe nguvu kwa mwananchi na mimi ambae nimechaguliwa tusaidiane ili tuweze 
kukomboa hi i nchi, na matumaini yan gu ikiw a leo tumeweza kufaulu na baba amekalia kiti basi 
nina imani 001 Joho nae atapeleka bendera … 
(Applause ) 
Kwa sababu ikiwa nimetoka hapa Pwani  majivuno yangu ni kesho pia mimi  nije 
nisimamishe R aisi na apite lakini sio kusema ati kwa sababu 001 Ali Hassan Joho anatoka katika 
jamii ambayo haijakuwa na wingi  wa watu ndio kuwe hatachaguliw a kuwa R aisi lakini 
nikimuangalia mambo yake yote ya uraisi yametimia . Kwa hi o ikiwa wao wa huko juu wazaa , 
hata sisi huku Mombasa pia twazaa  viongozi … 
(Applause ) 
Sasa sisi twaomba ikiwa leo tumepitisha  hii hoja , tunataka hii hoja ya M abunge ya 
wananchi tuende kwa kusaidiana hata kama ni Kilifi , ni Kwale M abunge yote tuweze 
kushirikiana na tuhakikishe tumeon yesha nguvu zetu ya kuwa tumekasirika hatutaki kutawaliwa 
na makabila ambayo ya najikita ni wao peke yao . Hapa Kenya tuna makabila tofauti, sisi tukiwa 
hapa Mombasa nikikwambia ule mchanganyiko uko hapa utastaajabu , lakini tumechaguliwa kwa 
sababu tunahudumia watu wa Kaunti ya Mombasa , Mawaziri waliochaguli wa hapa hata leo 
tuliowapitisha hapa n i Mawaziri ambao ni tofauti tofauti lakini wote wan akaa Kaunti ya 
Mombasa, tumekaa tukaona pia Gavana  amesongeza mkono kwa wale hata waliompinga na 
akaona hawa wanahitaji kuwa katika serikali ili aweze kuweka  nini? K itu kinaitwa uiano , leo hi i 
sisi tukiwa tunasema t unataka B unge la wan anchi sio kusema hatujiamini kw a kura maana 
tukisema leo hii kupigwe firimbi na t wende tupige kura leo na waambiwe  sasa nyinyi kaeni sisi 
twataka kura leo zipigwe za NASA , waone kivumbi cha vituoni mpaka saa tatu na milango 
haijafungwa kwa s ababu tuna jijua tuko na idadi,  tuko na uwezo lakini tunanyany aswa na ub aberi 
ambao tuliutoa 2010 wakati tulipo  pitisha K atiba, lakini unatumika kinyume kwa sababu 
wanataka kuonekana wao peke yake ndio wana uwezo .  
Mheshimiwa S pika tukis imama ha pa hatusimami t ukiwa na raha tunasimama ikiwa kudai 
haki y etu tukiwa na wenzetu ambao ni B unge la Wananchi, wacha tutapitisha hii hoja leo  leo na 
ikiwa wao ni wa kutubeba leo na waje watubebe sote , sisi hatuogopi kuingia ndani … 
(Applause )

this Motion  of the da y; the day's Motion  has come at the right time that our country is facing so 
many challenges, and I also want this nation to understand that the issues outlined in this Motion  
we are discussing today do no t start and end at the P residency , do not only  highlight what 
happened on August or 8th August . This Motion  Mr. Speaker has highlighted so many issues , and 
critical issues, that when we won't address or failure to address today this country may take a 
wrong direction . Mr. Speaker the Motion  has highlighted issue s to do with  the National Police 
Commission, the IEBC , the NIS , Public Service Commission  the EACC , National  Cohesion and 
Integration C ommission . Since independence we have had so many regimes , or rather 
governments  headed by different people ; we had the Kenyatta se nior, later we had the retired 
President Moi, we had the Kibaki , then Kibaki/ Raila’s government and then this oppressive , the 
very oppressive regime of the J ubilee .

DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 21 Mr. Speaker  we cannot afford to go through what we have gone through for the last five 
years,  we have seen so many issues hap pening and it is on record that since indepen dence it ’s 
only the J ubilee government that has recorded the highest cases of corruption , just in five years! 
We had the Moi ’s regime for 24  years and you cannot compare the numbers registered , the 
highest cases of corruption with the Jubilee government , and again as Kenyans we cannot afford 
for the next five years to be under the same regime, the regime that was unconstitutio nally 
selected not even elected. Mr. Speaker, t his said government has marginalized  so many 
communities just for the last five years ; in fact  its four and a half years , it is on record that 
Mombasa County government is the only government that has received the lowest budget 
allocation as far as the devolution is c oncerned, what's happening Mr. Speaker? What might be 
wrong with Mombasa County government? In fact  it only happens because of the affiliation s, 
because of the party affiliations, we cannot have a government that cannot address the issues 
affecting mwananchi , and we have no business to do with the government that is so oppressive , 
the government that is entitl ed to kill the citizens, the police today kill  the citizens tomorrow the 
so called P resident stands and congratulate s the police for a job well done, then you expect us to 
be under  the same government for the next five years , it cannot happen , it can’t  Mr. Speaker . The 
government that  selectively distributes the national resources ; why should a C ounty in Mount 
Kenya region receive 12 billion and another C ounty in the same country receive 4 billion , in the  
same financial year? We have no reasons to be under the same regime again, no rea son at all, we 
cannot afford to be under the same government that it ’s leaders are entitled to deal with other 
leaders whose political affil iations is of the opposite side.  
It's on record Mr. Speaker that his Excellency the P resident by then Hon.  Muigai  Uhuru 
Kenyatta  said that he will nyorosha  our Governor, for what reason? W e cannot be under a one 
party state ; we ran out of that system Mr. Speaker so many years ago, and again the same 
country , I mean  the same leaders cannot take us back to the same regime . So we must have a 
government , a government that recognizes  the C onstitution , the government that will respect 
other elected leaders despite having come from a different political affiliation.  Mr. Speaker a llow 
me to invite the Hon.  Members  of this  Hon.  House  to adopt this Motion  since it will  help us and 
the ordinary mwananchi ; we have so many speculations down there that by approving this 
Motion  our powers will be cut off, i have no reason to have more powers and yet the person i 
represent is suffering down there, we would rather share the po wers …  
(Applause)  
We would rather share the power s, this Hon.  House  and the P eople's Assembly;  as long 
as they will advocate for their rights . Mr. Speaker,  we the elected and nominate d leaders we have 
tried to outline the issues affecting our people , the former House  tried the same but the regime 
we have today does not appreciate, n ow the only way is to have the People's A ssembly in place 
so that we help each other to address the issues , maybe they might hear and respect . We have 
taken much time , in my own opinion this Motion was drafted by well informed minds, the minds 
of Hon.  James Orengo and the g roup and those are the walking C onstitutions and they have 
never failed us in any case and I believe in this Motion  it is there to deliver this country from the 
oppressive han ds of the two Kenyans ; Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto . I therefore invite this 
Hon.  House  to help me approve this Motion  and adopt it so that we ma y have a relief, thank you 
Mr. S peaker, be blessed.  
Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you Hon . Bwire.  Yes Hon . Ogutu and make it short.  
Hon. Ogutu: Thank y ou Mr . Speaker the essence of each election is to ensure that each 
vote counts ; in an event that you go for an election and the people are deprived of their right then 
election loses its meaning .

vulnerable , even one of them who is in parliament today has shown us that ...they don’t  have 
anything from the  governme nt that is in place  , so w ith those few remarks I support.

NASA , sisi kama Mombasa sote tumesimama kidete na tunaunga mkon o kupitisha Mswada wa 
Bunge la Wananchi na hii ni kwa sababu ya dhulma tulizoziona , haswa tarehe nane mwezi wa

tunaamini Raisi wetu Raila  Amolo  Odinga  ndio a liechaguliwa  siku ya tarehe nane mwezi wa

(Applause ) 
Lakini kwa ukora mwingi na wizi  mwingi  uliofanyika siku ile tulidhulumiwa na Rais 
akatangazwa U huru Muigai Kenyatta ; sisi tunapinga vikali na tunaamini k wamba  Raisi wetu ni 
Raila Amolo Oding a…

DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 23 Hon.  Mwam wiri: Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika kwa fursa hii adi mu kwa kuchangi a 
katika M swada wa kihistoria wa kuundwa kw a Bunge la Wananchi . Katiba ni kanuni inaongoza 
wananchi ama taifa kwa ujumla na walengwa katika K atiba huwa ni wananchi ndio m aana h ata 
katika utangulizi wa K atiba huanza na  preamble  ama utangulizi , we the people . Kwa hio ni fursa 
na ni sahihi ya kwamba makusu dio haya ni kwa ajili yetu sisi kama wana nchi ya kwamba tuna  
haki ya ku pata hudum a na utekelezaji kwa mujibu wa K atiba ile . Kwa mujibu wa kipengele cha 
kwanza kuna s ehemu tatu  muhimu zimegusiwa pale ikiwemo ; nguvu  za mwananchi,  nguvu za 
Katiba na nguvu ama ulinzi wa K atiba ile , kila mwananchi ana jukumu la kulinda Katiba ile na 
sisi kama Wananchi kusema tunaunga mkono ama Waheshimiwa wa B unge la Mombasa kusema 
tunaunga mkono ni mojawapo wa ku tekeleza nguvu zetu za kulinda K atiba yetu ya Kenya 
ambayo imewekeza nguvu  kwa mwananchi. Ng uvu hizi ziliporwa katika uchaguzi uliofanywa 
tarehe nane na 26 na watu wa  IEBC wakaziweka kwa mtoto wa Jomo  ambaye hakushi nda ki 
halali na sisi hatuna haja ya kumtambua wala kuunga mkono serikali  yake na yey e kama Raisi 
wa Jamhuri  ya Kenya … 
(Applause ) 
Mare geleo ya uchaguzi yalidhihi risha ya kwamba asilimia 70 ya W akenya wako na imani 
na Mheshimiwa Raila  ambaye hakua katika debe ; kwa hio asilimia kubwa haiwezi kutawaliwa 
na asilimia ndogo , ni sawasawa na akili ndogo kutawala akili kubwa . Kwa hayo naunga mkono 
Bunge la Wananchi na kuapishwa kwa Mheshimiwa R aila kama Raisi wa Bunge la Wananchi 
wa Jamhuri  ya Kenya.  Ahsante sana.  
(Applause ) 
Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank y ou. Hon . Mwalimu?  Make it short please.  
Hon. Mwalimu Hamad i: Ahsante s ana Mheshimiwa Spika mengi yamezungumzwa  na 
imedhihirika  wazi uchaguzi wa tarehe 26 vile ambavyo tuliona wiki nzima tulijua ukweli 
kwamba uchaguzi huu ulikuwa na matatizo ; sehemu kama ile ya Eldoret  ambako Bwana William 
Ruto  ametoka pia watu hawaku jitokeza kwa wingi , kuonyesha kwamba watu  walikuwa 
wamesinyika kweli na mambo haya . Haya n inayozungumza ni kwa niaba ya watu wa Shika  
Adabu am bao wamenituma leo ili n iweze kuu nga mkono hoja hii ya Bunge la Mwanan chi, kwa 
hio Bwana S pika kwa niaba yangu binafsi na watu wa Shika  Adabu tunaunga mkono hoja hii ya 
Bunge  la Mwananchi.  Ahsante.  
Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank  you. Yes Hon . Hatimy I have not heard your voice? 
Are you alive?  
Hon. Mohamed Hatimy:  Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika kwa kunipatia fursa hii na mimi 
sauti yangu ipate kusikika . Mheshimiwa Spika  nafikiri mengi yameongewa ndani ya N yumba hii 
na kama tunavyojua h ii ni N yumba ya sheria , na Nyumba ya sheria sisi tunaendeshwa na K anuni 
za Bunge . Ukiangalia Kanuni za Bunge letu nambari 172 iko wazi  ambayo inazungumza kuhusu 
mambo ya powers and privileges  ya N yumba hii . Nimesikia Wanachama f ulani wakizungumza 
kuwa sisi kuna pengine jambo la kuweza kuja kuvam iwa na kushikwa , lakini Kenya hii hii 
imetengenez a sharia , chini ya sheria ya powers and privileges  kifungu nambari 11 na kama 
utaniruhusu nisome  ambayo iko wazi inasema Mheshimiwa S pika, no proceedings or decisions 
of Parliament or the Committee of Powers and P rivilege acting in accordance with this A ct shall 
be questioned in any  court . Nikiendelea Mheshimiwa  Spika inasema  section  12 inasema , no civil 
or criminal proceedings shall be instituted against any Member for words spoken before or 
written in a Report to Parliament or a C ommittee by reason of any matter brought by him or her 
within by a Report, Petition,  Bill, Resolution,  Motion or  other document written to P arliament .

DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information

Speaker, the Leader of M ajority , Leader of M inority party , Chairperson of Committee s or 
Members for any act done or ordered by them in the discharge of their functions of the office . 
 Mheshimiwa S pika tukiendela na mimi kwa ufupi nataka kusema tuna sababu ya kusema 
kwa nini tunaipinga hii serikali , na hii serikali  wanavyodai wao kuwa wamechaguliwa , 
wamechag uliwa kikatiba,  tukiangalia Katiba hio  hio nikisema kwa Kiswahili nimezungumza juu 
ya Article  1 lakini mimi nitakwenda kwa Article  1(2) ambayo  inasema Mheshimiwa S pika kwa 
lugha ya Kiswahili , ‘Wana nchi watatekeleza mamlaka yao kwa njia ya moja kwa moja au kupitia 
kwa ku wakilisha wao wa liochaguliwa kidemokrasia’ , inama anisha nini Mheshimiwa  Spika? 
Kuwa sisi tuko ndani ya N yumba hii na yule Raisi amba e yuko pale ana yejiita Raisi ama  na mtu 
yeyote wataka tujue K atiba hii  hii ni delegated powers , si mimi mwenye nguvu, kwa sababu leo 
unaambiwa yule anae kuja kuwakilisha mwana nchi kweny e Bunge , kwenye K aunti ama MP ni 
kusema , la kwanza ni kuwakilisha , kwa hi o jambo hili la kuwakilisha linatokamana na  kutoka 
kwenye  Article  1 ya K atiba .  
Kwa hi o kwa ufupi tukienda kwenye Article  3 ndio mimi inanifanya nisitambue hio 
serikali  ninategemea  kifungu cha  Article  3 amba cho kinasema , ‘kulinda K atiba ’, kila mtu ana  
jukumu la kuheshimu,  kulinda na kutetea Katiba hii , tukienda nambari 2 jaribio lolote la kubuni 
serikali  bila kufuata K atiba hii ni kinyume cha sheria . Kwa hi o sisi tumefika hapo kusema kuwa 
serikali  hii imeundwa kinyume cha s heria kwa kufuata K atiba hii  hii. Kwa hio Mheshimiwa  
Spika kwa uchache ama kwa ufupi nataka kusema kuwa nashukuru Wanachama kama 
Mwenyekiti wa ODM kushukuru Wanachama wangu kwa kuweza kusimama wazi na kuonyesha 
imani walio  nayo juu ya chama na kusema kwa kauli moja watu wote kupitisha Mswada huu , 
kwa hio mimi Mheshimiwa Spika nasema na mimi pia naunga.  Ahsante s ana. 
Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank y ou. Yes Hon . Naliaka. No, s he has not spoken.  
Hon. (Ms.) Mukavi: Thank y ou Mr.  Speaker  for giving me this chance to contribute  to 
establishment of People ’s Assembly . I stand here in one piece not in pieces to su pport the 
establishment of the People’s A ssembly of Mombasa.  Thank you.  
Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank y ou Hon . Rosemary , sorry I called you Hon . Naliaka.  
Yes Hon . Moraa?  
Hon. (Ms.)  Ngare: Thank you Mr. Speaker for finally seeing me around , although 
everything has been said but let me st ate that today is a very important day actually, and you will 
notice that from the crowd that is up there , we have all been yearning for this day and we were 
almost being branded that we had been bought , we are  traitors knowing that Mombasa C ounty is 
where there is h ot politics , they expected us to pass thi s Motion at the earliest opportunity and 
here we are and I am sure some of those who have been bashing us that we have been bought are 
here now listening to us and they must be very happy , just the way we are .  
(Applause)  
So I stand in solidarity with the Hon. Members who have supported the M otion because 
we live in a country that is lacking political legitimacy . We live in a country  where we have lots 
and lots of corruption, tribalism  and marginalization , like the C ounty where we are we can say 
that we are actually marginalized because some things happen and you wonder , are we in 
Mombasa County or which County … 
(Interruption ) 
Are we together? Thank you Hon . Amu r, so we need to establish the Peoples A ssemblies 
so that we can deal with our issues  in the best way we know , if I can just mention something 
small just about a month ago a tunnel was dug in KCB Thika , and later when the young boys 
were taken to court the father was brave enough to ask how do you want our children to  learn?

DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information

money from the public coffers.  That is where  our children  are copying such kind of acts from, 
soon we shall be told our children  cannot learn good manners from leaders , who are trigger 
happy killing people here and there so in which country are we living and which country do we 
want.  We want  to establish the People’s Assembly according to A rticle 1 which gives the 
sovereign power to the people so today we are saying that the people of Mombasa are 
withdrawing the power that they donated to those people up there and they are bringing it back to 
them so that they can carry out their activities ; elect their P resident for example, and their vote 
will matter,  when they put a vote for Raila Amolo Odinga the computer should not come out 
with Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta . So we are giving the power back to the peop le so that we can carry 
out our activities in the best way we know how  possible , with that because there is no time 
teachers usually have a lot to say but I will cut short because you decided to give me last  but I 
had a lot to say,  and with that I want to urge our H on. Members that we ado pt this Motion and as 
another H on. Member said we will not need to stop at that we need to work much more so that 
we see that this works for the gain of  our people.  Than k you so m uch Mr. Speaker.  
Mr. Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank y ou Hon . Moraa. Thank you H on. Members for your 
contribut ion and I now call upon the mover wh o is H on. Hamisi Musa Mwidani , who is the 
Leader to reply.  
Leader of Majority (Hon. Mwidani ): Ahsant e sana Bwana Spika.  Kwanza na washukuru 
Wabunge wenzangu wote kwa nafasi  yenu hata kama Serem ametuumiza kwa sababu hatulip wi 
vikao hivi zamani tulikuwa tunalipwa lakini tunamuonyesha kwamba sisi tumejitolea 
tumechaguliwa na twaweza tunajitolea kufanya kazi hata kama hatulipwi . Kwa hio nashukuru  
Wabunge  wenzangu kuchukua muda huu kuweza kupitisha hoja hii na pia sitasahau wananchi 
waliokuja kwa gallery  leo na tuna waomba waka ti tuna vik ao muhimu wa we wanakuja kutuunga 
mkono kwa sababu hili ndio J umba lao sisi wengine kwanza tayari ni wazee tuko katika msururu

(Applause ) 
 Kwa hio Bwana S pika la m uhimu ni kwamba nina furaha na W aheshimiwa wenzangu

Bomoa , wajua Mheshimiwa Bomoa  umechapa ile inavyotakikana  na hakuna mahali mtu
