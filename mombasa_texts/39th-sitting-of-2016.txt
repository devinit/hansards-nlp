of the author;  I would like to move the Notice of M otion on the statistics of population of 
children in the County .

effective budgeting and planning for their immediate and long term benefit ;  
 
       I therefore  urge the County  Assembly to resolve that;  
 
       The County  government , to establish a mechanism for t he collection of statistics on children , 
in all Wards  in the County ; and to use them to plan and budget for beneficial projects and 
programs.
