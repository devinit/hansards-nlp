DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 6 Mr. Speaker as we speak it is only the Sports, Youth, and Gender Departmen t that has 
brought the response but as from the Auditor General we wrote a letter on 26th Marc h, 2019 
regarding responses to audit reports.  
Mr. Speaker what we received from the office of the Auditor General was that reports 
from t he County Executive for the FY 2013/2014 were submitted, FY 2014/2015 were 
submitted, FY 20 15/2016 they were not submitted  and FY 2016/2017 they were not submitted. 
And as I said earlier Mr. Speaker we as a Committee we cannot work on our own unless we g et 
status from the  office of the Auditor General , so the ones that have been submitted we as a 
Committee have worked upon those reports but we could not move further as no responses were 
taken to the office of the Auditor General.  
Mr. Speaker  No.2 was the County Assembly FY 2013/2014 submitted, FY 2014/2015 
submitted, 2015/2016 not submitted, 2016/2017 not submitted.   
Another Department from Water, MOWASCO, FY 2013 they submitted the responses, 
FY 2014/2015 not yet submitted, FY 2015/2016 not y et submitted, FY 2016/2017 not yet 
submitted Mr. Speaker.  
Elimu Fund FY 2013/2014 it was not established, FY 2014/2015 not established, FY 
2015/2016 not submitted, FY 2016/2017 not submitted.   
Alcoholic Fund FY 2013/2014 not established, FY 2014/2015 not es tablished, FY 
2015/2016 not established, FY 2015/2016 not submitted, FY 2016/2017 not submitted Mr. 
Speaker.   
The Revolving Fund FY 2013/2014 not established, FY 2014/205 not established, FY 
2015/2016 not established, FY 2016/2017 not submitted.   
Mr. Speaker  as you can see we have annexed  several letters showing that the PAC 
Committee is working tirelessly to make sure the Departments concerned bring the responses 
and th e Committe e to work upon those reports not as it was raised that the Committe e is sleeping 
on its work. Thank you.  
(Applause)  
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you Hon. Fadhili. Yes Hon. Charles Kitula?  
The Chief Whip  (Hon. Kitula) : Ahsante Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti . Mheshimiwa 
Mwenyekiti nimekaa na nikawa napitia  stakabadhi  amba zo Mweny ekiti wa Masuala ya PAC 
ameweza kuleta katika Bunge hili lakini la kushangaza barua hizi zote ni za mwaka 2019 . Audit 
querr ies zilikuja ni za mwaka 2017/2018 ikiwa sisi wa kwanza kuingia katika Bunge hili na 
mwaka 2018/2019 ndio tunasubiri. Sasa la kushangaza iweje barua zote hizi ni kama baada ya 
leo kutoa ile order  zilienda zikakaliwa, zikapigwa photocopy  ndio zikaletwa kwenye Bunge hili . 
Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti  na hii sio sawa inatoa heshima Bunge letu, haiwezekani  mikutano yote 
ikapangwa katika wiki moja kwa Idara zote kumi kwa pamoja Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti.  
Kwa hivyo sijaridhika sana na taarifa  inayoletwa katika Bunge hili na sisi kusema kweli 
Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti tulitaka mapendekezo ya FY 2017/2018 na hadi k ufikia hapo 
inaashiria kwamba Kamati  kama Kamati hawajakaa na kuweza kuangalia ni mbinu gani pesa 
zetu zilivyotumiwa katika miaka ambayo imeweza kutajwa katika audit query.  Ahsante 
Mheshimiwa Spika.  
 
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Hon. Charles Kitula that w as a Statement ... you were 
giving? So maybe Hon. Fadhili if you have  a  reply for the Hon. Member .  
July 23, 2019                             COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                           64 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 7 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu) : Thank you Mr. Speaker it  is unfortunate that the 
Hon. Members are missing these copies but what I can say is that the Hon. Member is 
misleading this House.  These letters were not don e on a single da y Mr. Speaker , i have  clearly 
said there  is a letter to the Office of the Auditor General dated 26th March, 2019; we wrote a 
letter to the Auditor Genera l on 26th March, 2019 and they brought their response which was 
received by the Assembly Clerk on 28th March, 2019 . 
Mr. Speaker there  is also another letter that was done on April 11th 2019 and I think April 
and July are differen t months of which there  is also a letter that was done on 18th July, 2019 and 
there  is also a letter that was done on 25th March, 2019 if am not wrong and also there  is an 
invite letter on 18th January, 2019 .. 
So Mr. Speaker the Hon. Member was somehow misleading the House saying that these 
all letters were done on a single day. Thank you Mr. Speaker.  
 
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Hon. Ibrahim?  
 
Hon. Omondi:  Mr. Speaker Point of Information. Mr. Speaker Si r we are at a standstill 
at this particular time and I would like the Chair Public Accounts Committee (PAC) to clarify to 
this House what does the technical hitch entails because this issue is talking about the technical 
hitch . I do not understand and you can see what he purports to be saying technical hitch is 
causing…?  Whereby  Hon. Speaker Sir we are not able to communicate.  
The document was supposed to have reach ed the Members and look at the documents and 
try to give o ur views Mr. Speaker Sir but now it has become an engagement between the two 
Members of this House; the Chief Whip and the Chair , Public Accounts Committee (PAC) . I 
think it is very unfortunate and therefore he will only do us good when he clarifies what does t his 
technical hitch entails so that we can be able to understand. Thank you Mr. Speaker Sir.  
 
The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) :  Thank you Hon. Ibrahim. Hon. Members I think the 
Chairperson said it very clear ly that he did  not have enough copies so what the Hon. Memb er 
will do is  he will get the other copies and give it to all the other Members and if you have any 
other thing you will bring the Statement on that issue. Yes Clerk continue .
