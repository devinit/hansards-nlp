 The Committee then decided  because they wanted to bring a very comprehensive and 
satisfactory report to this House rather than just making a response, the committee decided  to 
commit itself and went round almost all the Wards to see physically ; that is they did their site 
visit an d they visited  these ECDEâ€™ s Centers and also checked on the school milk program  of 
which the  Committee wr ote a  report .  
 After that  again  they had time to deliberate on the report  and eventually they wrote 
recommendation s so here I have a  report which I want to table plus the recommendation s and 
therefore it is my request Mr. Speaker Sir that you allow me to table this report . 
 
 The Deputy Speaker (Hon . Mwalimu) : Are you responding or you are tabling  a report?
