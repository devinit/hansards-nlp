Hon. Kibwana Swaleh : Thank you Honourable  Speaker . You know today is my day 
where am perusing a lot of papers and f igures  which are very h uge. Honourable  Speaker , as early 
as state d that  being th e Chair o f Finance Committee being supported by Commit tee Member s as 
well as the Secretariat , today  I am also honoured again  and delighted  to present the Report on the 
public participa tion, for the Mombasa C ounty Fiscal Strategy Paper that is 2023/2024 and  
Programm e Based Budget Estimate s, 2023/2024 for the Cou nty government of M ombasa . The 
two policy  documents for the County governme nt annual spending f or the upcoming year and 
both docume nts can be found , the annual recurr ent as well as development expendi ture based  on 
the priorities and ceilings se t by the County  government . Honourable  Speaker , the County Fiscal 
Strategy Paper 2023/2024 and Progra mme Based Budget Estimate , 2023/20 24 were submitted to 
the County Assemb ly by the County Executive Committee Me mbers of Fi nance and Economic  
Planning , has indicated in his letter Ref; CECM/F&EP  28th April , 2023.  Honourable  Speaker, as 
a Committee , we also have ar ea of observation and findings which a re contained in this  Report 
and one  of the highlights  that I want  to bring to  attention , is that among the notabl e development 
were to bring upward adjustment for the County Assembly  recurrent c eiling by the Senate by 
Kshs 72,507,500  Million for building , insuran ce, E-parliament , domestic and for eign and assets 
maintenan ce cost. So, I think as an Assembly we have been allocated more money  through the 
Senate, the  other area Honourable  Speak er because it is wide and Members have this Report, 
â€˜The Committee also noted challen ges in complying with fiscal respon sibility princi pal, 
especi ally in terms of compensation to employ ees which is beyond the se ttle image which is 35  
per cent  set by the public finan ce ministry of the Act, 2012 and itâ€™s  a regula tion.

County , where am coming from includi ng also peop le living with disability are part of the views 
that we recei ved, Honourable  Speaker another issue that was also captu red is the issue of 
MOWASC O, it mean s the accountabi lity of this department is very imp ortant and we found that ,
