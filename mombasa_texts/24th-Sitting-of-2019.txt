SHORTAGE OF DRUGS AT JUNDA DI SPENSARY  
 Yes Hon. Kibwana Swaleh . 
 Hon. Kibwana Swaleh:  Thank you Hon. Speaker. Hon. Speaker I wish to bring the 
statement that was raised by my colleague from Junda Hon. Musumba Raphael Bwire.  
 Mr. Speak er Sir, I would like to give a  Statement in response to shortage of drugs at 
Junda Dispensary as requested by Hon. Musumba Member of County Assembly from Junda 
Ward, during the 13th sitting on 12th March . 2019 of this House.  
 Mr. Speaker Sir, p ublic facilities have been experiencing st ock out for some essential  
medicines and medical supplies; t he shortage has been occasioned by some technicalities in the 
processing of the payment for the previous supplies from KEMSA through IFMIS.  
 Mr. Speaker , the County Executive Committee Member  (CEC M), Department of 
Health  wrote a commitment letter to CE O KEMSA dated 13th March, 2019 to request that the 
orders for Mombasa be processed urgently as the Department undertakes to promptly sort out the 
payment. Mr. Speaker the request was finally approved last week and the drugs have now been 
dispatched to the transporter. All facilities including Junda are expected to start receiving drugs 
in the course of this week.  
 Mr. Speaker Sir, in order to ensure that we do not end up with the same problem, the 
Depa rtment of Health has arranged for a meeting with KEMSA Regional Manager to streamline 
the ordering and documentation process.  
 So Hon. Speaker I think this will probably will shed light on how the drugs will be 
supplied in every Ward as this process has b een done  (??) the agreement and I have stated here 
that the meeting will also help w here there would be a problem like this in future. Thank you 
Hon. Speaker .   
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you very much Hon. Kibwana. Yes Clerk next 
order please?

electorate  gave us the power to fulfil their dreams, the wi ngs to fly their message of hope and the 
words to speak to the expectant masses and it  is very important t hat the person who brought the 
Motion has put that in consideration.  You know very much that the things that we have b efore us

maintenance of the road, matters to uching on the issues of bursary ...
