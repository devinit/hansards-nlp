Muundo  yategemea na ma haba ya mtu anatengezewa kuli ngana na mahaba alio  nayo. Kwa hivyo 
kuna Waheshimiwa hapa wanan iambia miwani ni kubwa sawia na  parare mwitu , lakini kusudio 
wanajua n a hata yangu ji nsi ilivyo ni fahari yangu kwamba itengezwe kwa muundo huo lakini 
sababu ya mim i kuivaa ni daktari wangu wa macho ndio alieniongoza pengine anigaramikie

kilichonipendeza ni kwamba hu yu ni mzaliwa wa hapa n a hii ni is hara kwamba dhana ambayo  
imekuwa hapa nje kwamba wazaliwa wa Pwani hawajasoma naona tunae ndelea kukabiliana 
nayo vilivyo . Kwa sababu hapa tunam uona yuko na Masters degree kutoka Jomo Kenyatta na 
ukiangalia mahali alipoanzia Mheshimiwa Spika inatia moyo kwa mba alianzia chuo cha 
mafunzo ya daktari al maarufu  Kenya Medical Training College  na alipotoka hapo akaongezea 
masomo ameenda amefan ya degree  na sasa ako na hiyo Masters na ukiangalia pia katika historia
