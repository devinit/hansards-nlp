(Hon. Nyiro moved the Notice of Motion)  
 
THAT AWARE  that elderly face constant challenges when it comes to access and 
affordability of medical care;  
 
FURTHER AWARE that the elderly are often dependent on their children or extend 
families in order to meet the high cost of medical care;  
 
NOTING THAT the national government through the National Health Insurance Fund 
(NHIF) l aunched free medical cover aimed at helping the elderly specifically those aged 
above 70years;  
 
FURTHER NOTING THAT the free medical cover by the NHIF is yet to be fully 
implemented and does not cover those below 70 years but who are aged and are 
vulnerabl e to various diseases and are unable to afford paying for the NHIF medical 
cover ;
