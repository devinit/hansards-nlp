STATEMENT  
 Hon.  Onje . 
 Hon. Onje:  Thank you Hon. Speaker I have a statement . My statement is 
concerning misuse of inspectorate vehicle in Junda Ward Mishomoroni.  
(Hon. Onje moved the Statement)  
 Hon. Speaker  I seek to know from the Chairperson, Committee on Administration 
of County Security whether he is aware that the Inspectorate vehicles are being used by 
persons who a re not employees of the County government of Mombasa, to hara ss the 
residents of Junda Ward and the specific measures th at will be taken by the County 
government to remedy the situation.  
 Bwana Spika niki rudi kutaka  kufafanua zaidi hii ni kitu ime fanyika kwa mara ya 
tatu na wale ambao wanakuja wakitumia gari yetu ya Inspectorate wanavaa kirai a hawavai 
zile sare za Inspectorate  lakini inasemekana ni polisi lakini ikiwa wanatumia magari zetu za 
Inspectorate  kuja kuchapa wananchi viboko na kuwapiga si  vizuri si vyema . Mimi kama 
Mwakilishi wa eneo la Junda  naomba k itengo husika  waangalie ni kina nani wanafanya hio 
kazi na ninajua ya kwamba Inspectorate  Chairman  hawezi kukosa kujua ni kina nani 
wanafanya hio kazi maana yake kila mara gari ikitoka kwenda k ufanya kazi lazima kuna duty 
au assignment amba yo wanapewa waweke sahihi ijulikane hio gari inakwenda kufanya kazi 
sehemu gani.  
 Mimi sitaki kusikia tena maana yake huu ni wakati wa siasa na kila mwananchi 
anakubaliwa kuuza sera zake ama kuunga mkono mtu y eyote sitaki nione tena wanakuja 
kuchapa watu bila makosa yeyote , sheria ni kama kwamba una makosa unachukuliwa 
unapelekwa polisi kisha baadae unapelekwa kotini kwenda kujitetea mwenyewe lakini wale 
sheria ambayo wanachukua  mkononi kwenda  kuchapa watu vibo ko si vyema na mimi nikiona 
hiyo kitu ikiwa bado itakuwa inaendelea mbele itabidi ni  mobilise  watu wangu na hata  kama  
hiyo gari tuzingire tujue ni kina nani , hata kama ni kufanya nini tutafanya kwa sababu 
wanafanya yale ambayo hayafa i, mimi kama Mwakilishi naomba nipate kujua vizuri kutoka 
kwa K amati husika. Ahsante sana.
