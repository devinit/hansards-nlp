NOTICE OF MOTION  
       Hon. Caroline Owino ... 
       Hon. (Ms.)  Owino : Mr. Speaker S ir. Notice of M otion for establishment of child care center 
for st ate and public officers of the C ounty government.  
       Mr. Speaker S ir, I beg t o give notice of the following M otion:  
ESTABLISHMENT OF CHILD CARE CENTERS FOR PUBLIC OFFICERS OF THE 
COUNTY GOVERNMENT  
       "THAT AWARE that the C onstitution of Keny a Fourth Sc hedule Part 2 (9) mandates the 
County governments to operate childcare facilities;  
       FURTHER AWARE that the C ounty government has underutilized health and educational 
facilities with the adequate space which could be used as childcare facil ity. 
       NOTING that the C ounty government’s state and public officers with young children are 
direly in need of a center where their young children could be well -taken care of while they are 
engaged at work.  
       CONCERNED that a lack of child care f acility denies the C ounty government’s young 
mothers of an important service.  
       I therefore urge the County A ssembly to RESOLVE that:  
       The C ounty government to establish and operate a child care facility for state and p ublic 
officers working for  the C ounty government.  
(Hon. (Ms.) Owino ended Notice of Motion)  
       Mr. Speaker sir I urg e to ask to plead so that this M otion can debated ; 
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes granted. Yes C lerk. 
STATEMENT  
       Yes Hon. Amur.  
       Hon. Amur: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker S ir on the 6th of October in this H on. 
House  I brought a statement on the question of a senior business license of only one person.  
October  25, 2016                        COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                        125 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report  can be obtained from the Hansard Editor   Page 8        Mr. Speaker Sir I have proof that the cancellation of that license has been d one but the same 
person is still conducting his business in the CBD . 
       So I seek the H ouse approval so that the person can be arrested in the court of law so that he 
can be charged.  
       Mr. Speaker S ir I wish to table this for your confirmation.  
Paper laid  
       These are the copies of the r eport Mr. Speaker sir given to the Members of the H on. House.  
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Sergeant At A rms remember when you are crossing 
the flo or you have to bow.  
       Hon. Amur : Mr. Speaker for one person to be granted a license to do business  while others 
have been refused.  
       When I tabled that issue in the A ssembly I was requested by the H ouse to bring any proof 
that a single business has been given to that person.  
       Mr. Speaker Sir the evide nce that I brought in this H ouse this af ternoon clearly shows even 
the County S ecretary has written to the same person saying he should stop continuing selling the 
merchandise in the streets until he has an official premises so that he conduct s his business.  
       Mr. Speaker Sir I kindly request this House to give a notice that the I nspectorate department 
should be arresting a person seen doing business on the CBD of the town of Mombasa . 
       Mr. Speaker it is unfair for only one person to  be given a license while there are so many 
others being denied that opportunity.  
       Everyone has to do business and we are supposed to be handling all the members of the 
public equally, there should be no issue of only one person being given an autho rity to do 
business while others denied Mr. Speaker.  
       It is upon us Mr. Speaker to give powers to the Inspectorate department so that they can 
arrest if so is still in the CBD doing business as the letters confirm the cancelation of the Single 
Busin ess P ermit , thank you Mr. Speaker.  
(Applause)  
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Thank you Hon. Amur. Hon. Amur  
       Hon. Amur : Yes .

DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information

Amur as per the procedur es of this H ouse. 
       We shall not issue an order of arrest to the pers on concerned but we’ll let the C ommittee on

       If the C ommittee will recommend arrest or business to be stopped to operate then we ’ll take

       Hon. Mohamed Hatimy : Thank you Mr. Speaker. I just want to inform this House that we

(Hon. (Ms.) Ouma ended the Motion)  
       I urge Hon. Hatimy Mohamed to second the M otion . 
(Hon. Hatimy seconded through gesturing)  
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : The M otion has been seconded . I now propose a 
question that the M otion on establishment of child care cent ers for public officers of the County 
government be deliberated  in this House . 
(Question put and agreed to)  
(Applause ) 
       Yes Hon. Caro . 
       Hon. (Ms.) Auma:  Hon. Speaker, I’ve been going around and I came across that almost 
every woman or a mo ther who is working within the C ounty government is suffering whereby 
every woman has been given an opportunity to breas t feed her child for  six months.  
       As you know according to the rule that after giving birth she is going to be given a leave of 
three months so the other three months they spend it on this child  to get close to the mothers.  
       So I was having a suggestion whereby if  we have a facility or a healthcare where every 
mother can take the child to that place and given a chance to breast feed the child Hon. Speaker , 
that’s why I see it is so important to c ome up with this M otion so that to encourage and make 
sure they can ma ke their work to be very ef fective, thank you Mr. Speaker S ir. 
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes Hon. Asha Hussein . 
       Hon. (Mrs.) Hussein:  Thank you Mr.  Speaker am here to second the M otion proposed by 
Madam Caroline.  
October  25, 2016                        COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                        125 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report  can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 11        Mr. Speaker Sir it is very essential for children to be breastfeed ; as we can s ee we are losing 
the generation.  
       We can see we have young boys moving around givi ng problems to the community, one of 
the things they have lacked breast milk it is very essential in up bringing a child we need bright 
students, we need engineers , we need professionals all sorts . 
       We need a peaceful Mombasa County government within Mombasa hence mothers need to 
be given a side within the institution so that they are able to breast fe ed the children ; at least 
three times a day while they are at work, and it is their constitutional right, it is not by begging or 
this should not be begged for they are workers they need to be given their right to breast feed and 
take care of their childre n while they are at work. Thank you Mr. Speaker sir  
      Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes Hon. Amur . 
       Hon. Amur : Mr. Speaker Sir I beg to oppose the issue, it is a mandatory right by the 
constitution yes, but things have to be planned .  
       We cannot br ing a M otion today requesting us to do such things, we need to employ people, 
a budget has to be made for that employment of those people, inf rastructure of a place where by 
these  people would be catering for their  young babies need be establish ed according to the 
budget.  
       It is tru e that babies need to be breast fed but the law allowed three months leave and they are 
getting their salaries ; the husbands are given two weeks , on top of that Mr. Speaker there are 
other arrangem ents at  the ins titution whereby mothers are given chances to go home earlier if 
you are supposed to breastfeed you are allowed to leave at 12, whereby if you are supposed to 
leave at 5 .00pm  then you can leave at 12 . 
       It is also a beneficiary to the mothers, so ther e is no issue of sayi ng that, it is a fact of 
budget , it has to be budgeted for because it is a matter of employment , we employ people but 
people with experience of handling children...  
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : There is a point of order . 
(Applause ) 
       Hon. (Ms) Auma : Mr. Speaker i just want Hon.  Amu r to understand when i bring a M otion 
here it is not supposed to be done the same time but to be planned for;  another thing I want to 
clarify we are not going to employ people we have nursing mothers in Makadara hospital, we 
can use those women so that they can help us when we are preparing for this.  
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes Hon Murfad .

DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information

by the constitution yes but the fact is for any organization  to do anything it has to budget for, 
today we are over the budget . 
       Mr. Speaker if we are to employ how many people are supposed to be employed to take care 
of those kids, these  kids need special care ; it's not about taking kids and putting them in a room 
but with special care , tender care.  
       It is supposed to employ people with experience , issue of breastfeeding 90% of mothers 
these days are avoiding breastfeeding to mainta in their bodies and their figures ... 
(Laughter ) 
       It is not a subject of but it is their constituti onal right, it has to be budgeted for Mr S peaker..  
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) :  Yes Hon Zeinab . 
       Hon.  (Ms.)  Zeinab Mumba : Ahsante M heshim iwa Spika nimesimama kumwambia 
Mheshimiwa mwenzangu ya kwamba ...

       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Address the House . 
       Hon. (Ms.) Zeinab Mumba:  Okay, a hsante Mheshimiwa  Spika. M imi ningependa kusema 
ya kwamba mimi kama mama kitu naomba a withdraw statement  yake kwa sab abu mama ni haki 
yake anyonye she mtoto wake kwa miaka miwili.  
       Akisema  asilimia  90 ya kina mama hawanyonyeshi ni uwongo, mimi ni mama na 
nanyo nyesha  mtoto wangu kwa miaka miwili, ah sante sana Mheshimiwa Sp ika 
       Hon. Amur : Mr. Speaker i will not cancel whatever i said,  if they breastfeed how many 
kinds of milk we are buying ; as fathers buy for our babies ... 
(Applause ) 
       If breastfeeding could be taken permanent we should not have pampers, milk at t he 
supermarkets, why today we don't have good kids because the moth ers have neglected their 
duties...     
(Applause ) 
       They are u sing pampers instead of napkins , things have changed, modernization. .. 
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes Hon Car oline, and i hope it is not a fight 
between the women an d the g entlemen of this House ...

mothers, they are given three months and they are here with us ...  
(Applause ) 
       There are those who are allergic to beef , what are they doing, so it is issue of ladies or our 
wives neglecting their kids by maintaining their bodies and the ot her things...  
(Applause ) 
       Yes Hon . Asha Hussein.  
       Hon. (Ms.) Hussein:  Thank you Mr. S peaker, i want to c larify to my brother Amur, the 
Motion is all  about day  cares for the mothers working within the C ounty governments 
institutions, it 's not about ne gligence or arrogance or modernization , can he please get back to the 
Motion Mr. S peaker . 
(Applause ) 
       Hon. Amur : Mr. Speaker these  same mothers if you offer them  a trip for 20 days they will 
travel , they will never think of their children and babies ... 
(Applause ) 
(Laughter ) 
       That's a fact, offer any Member of the County A ssembly a trip for 20 days and he or she will 
forget the baby . 
       I am not saying it is not their right but it has to be captured in the budget to employ the 
workers to take  care of the kids. 
       We don't have that allocation , in the meantime  let it be until further notice . Thank you Mr. 
Speaker.

DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report  can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 15        Hon. Speaker if you come to the p rayer of this Motion it says the C ounty government 
establish and operate a childcare facility for state and p ublic officers working for the C ounty 
government . 
       I am saying on this perspective because when you  look at the rate, let us speak  of how many 
government facilities do we have in Mombasa?  
       It is not elaborative , it is not showing how these  facilities are going to be made, that is o ne, 
two, as you know that this is a budget process where it also incur s some expenses ; we are not 
saying it is bad but what we are looking is the project sustainable ? 
       So if we as the law makers in this Assembly we would wish to come with good ideas like 
this but also we have to think about how to operate it because if we are going to set everywhere 
mothers are coming to breastfeed their children, this one i think to me it is not possible, we have 
also a problem of the youth s, we have no youth centers , the centers  are there but no people to 
operate them . 
       This is a burden i think sometimes back if not one month there were some letter s addressed 
to  Chairman F inance so that he can see on how we can operate this one Hon . Speaker . 
       I have firm ly oppose d this M otion that there is no clarity in how it is going to operate these 
facilities, and therefore I remind the Hon . Member who moved this Motion not to mislead this 
Assembly  and the Mombasa people she withdraws so that we can al so and discuss, thank you 
Hon. S peaker.  
(Applause ) 
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes Hon . Siminyu . 
       Hon. Siminyu: Thank you Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker the M otion is a good M otion so it is 
good to take care of our children who are newborns.  
       Mr. Speak er I do support this M otion for a fact that it seems that we are selfish . 
       Mr. Speaker devolution came to this country , we always talk about our selves  but why not 
about our people when a person is working and he has children , he need s to take care of  the 
children.  
       Mr. Speaker I would like to urge the Hon . Member to recall this Motion back so that she can 
seat so that it can involve more people , we should not talk for ourselves , let us talk for the 
common mwananchi , Mama Mboga.  
       Mr. Spea ker this Motion as I said earlier is a good Motion because this is a place where they 
can take the ir kids where there are working.

DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information

Speaker so the M otion mover  should go and sit with the Finance a nd see if we can have the 
money .  
     urge this Member who brought this M otion to this House  to go back and look into this Motion 
and when brought back to this House it should be fully furnish ed for the common mwananch i.         
       Thank you Mr. Speaker.  
(Applause ) 
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Yes Hon . Enock Mwinga Mwadziwe . 
       Hon. Mwinga:  Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa Spika . Mheshimiwa Spika mtoto anataka malezi 
bora, mtoto anataka hususan malezi ya mama  kwa sababu mama huwa ana mtoto saa zote. 
Mheshimiwa Spika mimi nimesimama hapa kuunga mkono mswada huu ambao umeletwa hapa . 
       Sababu ambazo zinanifanya niunge mkono huu mswada Mheshimiwa Spika unavyojua 
kwamba mtoto anapozaliwa anahitaji malezi bora na unapoona, unaposikia katika habari watoto 
wanadhulumiwa na wale mayaya ambao wanakaa nao.  
       Mheshimiwa Spika ndio basi tunafaa kuhakikisha ya kwamba mtoto awe karibu na mama ili 
huduma zile wanazozipata kupitia kwa wale mayaya zikaweze kukomeshwa.   
       Mheshimiwa Spika tuchukue kwa mfano mtoto amewachwa kwa nyumba amewaachiwa 
yaya....  
(Interruption ) 
       Hon. Mohamed Ndanda: Mr. Speaker point of information . 
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) : Do you want to inform the House or what?  
       Hon. Mohamed Ndanda:  I want to inform the House that the for the current Speaker am 
informing the House not him.  
       Thank you Mr. Speaker  he is talking of the yaya  and I think the facility there are also those 
maids , who will be there ? So I don't k now, can he clarify between the person who is not going to 
take care of the facility and the same is said because at home those children are being battered by 
the yaya  the way he is saying , so it is a point of clarity his statement Hon . Speaker.  
       Hon. Mwinga:  Mheshimiwa Spika nafikiri Mh eshimiwa ambaye ameweza kuleta Mswada  
ameweza kueleza wazi wazi ya kwamba wale ambao watakuwa wanaangalia ni watu ambao ni 
wenye utenda kazi  wamefanya mafunzo na kuangalia hawa watoto.  
October  25, 2016                        COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                        125 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report  can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 17        Tuchukue kwa mfano mtoto amewachwa kwa nyumba ameachiwa mfanyi  kazi Mheshimiwa 
Spika yule mfanyi  kazi hata hapewi chakula mtoto anakaa anashinda na njaa kutoka saa mbili 
asubuhi mpaka saa kumi na mbili jioni mama akirudi.  
       Mheshimiwa Spika nafikiri kuna umuhimu waweze kuten gewa mahali wa mama hawa 
waweze kuwa karibu na watoto wao ...  
(Applause ) 
       Hili ni jambo muhimu Mheshimiwa Spika kwa sababu mtoto anapokuwa akikosa maziwa ya 
mama hali haitakuwa nzuri.  
       Kwa hivyo kuna umuh imu watengewe mahali kama vile Mswada u livyosema ili wanapokaa 
kazini baada ya masaa manne waweze kutoka kunyonyesha mtoto ili warudi na kuendelea na 
kazi nyengine. A hsante sana.  
(Applause ) 
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) :  Yes Hon . Fatuma Kushe . 
       Hon. (Ms.) Fatuma  Swaleh : Ahsante  sana Mheshimiwa Spika.  Mheshimiwa Spika mimi 
nimesimama kupinga mjadala huu ... 
(Applause ) 
       Mheshimiwa Spika kama unavyojua mimi ni mwanamke ; vile vile nashukuru Mwenyezi 
Mungu kwamba mimi ni mzazi nina mtoto wa miezi sita ndani ya nyumba Mheshimiwa Spika. ..  
(Applause ) 
       Mheshimiwa Spika sio kwamba tunakaa hapa masaa 24 huwa tuko hapa baada ya masaa 
fulani tunarudi majumbani kwetu . 
       Mheshimiwa Spika kama unavyojua kwamba Mombasa huwa tuna uhaba wa pesa 
tunazoletewa kutoka kwa serikali kuu na vile vile mimi nimesema mtoto wangu yuko nyumbani . 
       Kama wanawake wanasema wanataka kukaa na watoto wao majumbani basi wanawake hao 
wasimame waende wakakae nyumbani , wakae wake nyumbani na wafanyi  kazi Mheshimiwa 
Spika ...  
(Applause ) 
       Sio ka ma nahujum u wanawake wenzangu lakini tukisema kwamba tunakaa majumbani 
kwetu tukiangalia watoto, serikali imetupatia miezi mitatu kukaa kuwaangalia watoto 
Mheshimiwa Spika.  
October  25, 2016                        COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                        125 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report  can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 18        Kwa hivyo nafikiri miezi mitatu ni miezi mingi sana kulea watoto na vile vi le hatuka i masaa 
24 ndani ya makazi yetu.  
       Mimi kama Mheshimiwa Fatuma ninao wasaa wa  kwenda kukaa na mtoto wangu 
kumnyonyesha na vile vile tukisema twakaa kuangalia watoto tutawapotezea nafasi za wanaume 
watatutawala kila sehemu Mheshimiwa Spika.  
(Applause ) 
       Ndio maana Mheshimiwa Spika napinga mjadala huu na akakae afikirie mjadala mwengine 
lakini ikiwa nii huu mimi naupinga.  
(Applause ) 
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mwalimu) :  Mheshimiwa Zainab Kithinzi . 
       Hon. (Ms.) Zainab Kithinzi:  Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika, mimi ni mama na mimi nina 
experience  ya kuzaa na kulea lakini nimesimama hapa kupinga huu mjadala. .. 
(Laughter and Applause ) 
       Mheshimiwa Spika naupinga kwanza kwa mambo mawili ama matatu; jambo la kwanza 
kuna msaada ambao umeing ia siku hizi watu wanasema ni dijitali  wakati wewe ni mzazi ukitoka 
nyumbani kuna jinsi ya kukamua maziwa yako unaweka kwa njia nzuri unaweka kwa chupa 
baadaye mtoto anapewa si lazima wewe mzazi uwe pale.  
       Jambo la pili Mheshimiwa Spika ikiwa hii se hemu itatengwa sisi tena tutarudi kusema kina 
dada wakae maofisini wafanye kazi kwa sababu kila mara watakuwa wako huko ukimuuliza 
atakuwa anakwambia nimeenda kumnyonyesha mtoto . 
       Kwa hivyo hilo m imi sioni kama ni jambo la sawa; v ile vile pia Mheshim iwa Spika kuna 
mambo mengi ambayo yanafaa yafanywe katika hii Mombasa Kaunti sio haya ya  kuangalia 
sehemu ya kunyonyesha watoto.  
       Mheshimi wa Spika nilipoingia hapa kuna W aheshimiwa wengi ambao walijifungua na trip 
zikitokea yeye ndio atakuwa wa kwan za kusema niko maternity nanyonyesha lakini nitaenda ...  
(Applause ) 
       Na wanaenda kwani saa hiyo hawafikirii wa nataka kunyonyesha?  Kwa hivyo Mheshimiwa 
Spika nimesimama hapa kupinga vikali sana huu mswada.  
(Applause ) 
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mw alimu) : Yes Hon . Hatimy . 
October  25, 2016                        COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                        125 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report  can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 19        Hon. Mohamed Hatimy:  Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa Spika kunipatia mimi fursa hii kuweza 
kuongea mawili matatu kuhusiana na mswada huu ambao umeletwa na Mheshimiwa Caroline.    
       Mheshimiwa Spika nafahamu kwamba N yumba nilile ta Mswada aende aku tizame na 
utengeneze ndio auregeshe tena ndani ya hii Nyumba ; kusema hivi sisi tumeleta katiba na katiba 
ile iko wazi kabisa . 
       Ukiangalia Article 27 (1) ya katiba ambayo inasema , "Every person is equal before the law 
and has the ri ght to equal protection and equal benefit of the law ".  
       (2) Inasema, "Equality includes the full and equal enjoyment of all rights and fundamental 
freedoms ", Mheshimiwa Spika.  
       Kwa hiyo Mheshimiwa Spika sheria ni msumeno na sheria hii kila mm oja ana haki nayo na 
kama ni sheria inamshika kila mmoja.  
       Mheshimiwa Sp ika kusema tuwafanyia Nyumba hii kuwa  stamp public officers  na state 
officers  itakuwa tumefanya ubaguzi wa  kuwatoa wale watu wengine.  
       Kwa hiyo Mheshimiwa S pika naomba aliyeleta hoja hii mwanzo aende abadilishe  hii title ya 
hii hoja , la pili afanye utafiti  kwa sababu anavyojua sisi kama Kaunti ya Mombasa  hatuna pesa 
na pia jambo hili lataka pesa ahakikishe kwamba amefanya utafiti  wake atueleze atatumia mfuko 
gani wa kuweza kujenga hizi center ambazo tunazungumza alafu ndio sisi hapa tusema kama 
hoja inafaa . 
       Kwa hivyo Bwana Spika naona huu mswada umekuja mahali pazuri lakini kwa wakati 
mbaya kwa sababu lazima atengeneze aregeshe hapa . 
       Kwa hivyo namuomba a itoe chini ya hoja za nidhamu 48 kitabu hiki kipya ya kusema kuwa 
anaitoa saa yeyote  na anaweza  irudisha …Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika.  
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mw alimu) : Hon. Hatimy Standing order 48 it concerns the 
Notice of Motion … 
       Hon. Mohamed Hatimy:  It is a Motion Mr. Speaker and can be withdrawn without leave 
and can be brought any time Mr.  Speaker.  
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mw alimu) : Thank you , yes Hon . Jimmy Odari?  
       Hon. Odari:  Thank you Hon. Speaker  for according me this opportunity to contribute to 
give my opinion  or observation regarding this Motion whic h has been brought by Hon. Auma 
nomin ated MCA for Kisauni sub County . 
       Hon. Speaker this Motion states inter  alia the establishment of child care center for state 
and public officers  of the County government . 
October  25, 2016                        COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                        125 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report  can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 20        Mr. Speaker this is not a bad idea , this idea of establishing a care center is expressly 
stipulated in the 4th Schedule of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 Part 2, Sub section  9 . 
       It states if you will allow me Mr. Speaker to read the idea of setting up child care center is 
cited as one of the fun ctions of the County government  and it is hereby listed alongside pre - 
primary education those are the ECD centers , village polytechnics, home  craft centers and 
child care facilities . 
       Therefore this Motion must have emanated from  that part of the constitu tion since it has 
been stipulated in the constitution Hon. Speaker  this needs to be established . 
       I have listened carefully to most speakers this afternoon and what I have noticed the cost 
elements of establishing th ese centers is one of the major bone of contention here . 
       Mr. Speaker childcare centers are not a bad idea however as stated by Hon . Hatimy I would 
advise the mover of this Motion to take it b ack if she wouldn’t mind and r e–write it so that it will 
not look as if this privilege  is meant only for state officers or public officers yet the constitution 
requires it to be all inclusive . 
       The entire  public of the Republic of Kenya child care centers are there owned by private 
proprietors ; they are all over  however I think maybe Hon. Caroline wanted t o request for a room   
for the Hon. Members to breastfeed their children . 
       If it’s a matter of maybe allocating a room within th e precincts, th ese premises for Hon. 
Members who are breastfeeding so that they can breastfeed t heir children . 
       I do not think that can be expensive , I do not t hink it will be costly to this Assembly  but if it 
is a matter of establishing whole facility for childcare I think Mr. Speaker we need to reconsider 
the co st implication . 
       Particularly bearing in mind that currently the County government of Mombasa is grappling 
with the high cost of projects that are to be implemented that are following a very strict budget 
which has impeded implementation of other projects that are being demanded by the public . 
       Thank you Mr. Speaker .  
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mw alimu) : Hon. Caroline respond to the Motion and also put 
into considera tion that the seconder of this Motion has also opposed the Motion.  
(Applause ) 
       Hon. (Ms.) Auma : Thank you Hon. Speake r the seconder has opposed the  Motion , he has  
given it a good direction where to go . 
October  25, 2016                        COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                        125 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report  can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 21        I see Members have agreed to the Motion but because of the many amendments and the 
amendments which have been put across are very important we cannot work on only County 
offices alone but we need to  work on the entire County . 
       So Hon. Speaker I urge you as the Speaker see what we can do to the Motion so that we can 
give him more time and see if I can use amendments that I have been given to restructure it 
again. Hon . Speaker I withdraw the  Motion.  
(Applause ) 
       Temporary Speaker (Hon. Mw alimu) : I think you have fully exhausted th is debate and as 
the move r the Motion was debated …and Hon. Members they put much concern on monetary 
implications and the mover did not specify the number of facilities as she has withdrawn un der   
Standin g order number 48 which says a Notice of Motion maybe withdrawn by the Member who 
gave the notice,  but notice of the same Motion may be given again eith er by the same or by  any 
other Member . 
       So Members the Motion  has been withdrawn from the floor of the House and will bring back 
the Motion with the amendments in another way an d it will be taken back to the House Business 
Committee to plan and be brought to this Hon. House.  Clerk?  
ADJOURNMENT
