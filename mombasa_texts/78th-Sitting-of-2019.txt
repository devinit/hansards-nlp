now propose a question that C lause 16 as amended be part of the Bill, any input?  
 Hon. Amriya Juma : Mr. Speaker , am cautious because I do  not know if Members have 
internalise d the effect of substi tuting  the word corporation  with authority . Am afraid Mr. 
Speaker we  will be faced with litig ation once we approve this Bill  because as much as we are not 
late to amend we can amend that C lause from onwards to read as  authority  moving forward from 
Clause 6  to otherwise. B ecause my fear is Mr. Chairman when we introduce the word 
corporation  we are going to open up a Pandora box Mr. Speaker of litigation, because am being 
corrected by the Leader of Majority that it 's Chairman .... Y ou understand that the i llega l 
implication is that a corpora tion is a form of a company and th e company is under the Company 
Act, there  are certain regulation s that the new Company A ct, 2015 on how companies are 
supposed to be conducted and their capacity and their legal implications of operating companies. 
 So my reservation is with al ive to that , I hope all Members are ali ve to the fact that now it  
is a company, it  is no longer the intention of the executive to put it as an authority, you see an 
authority is an administrative body th at has powers to oversee the administrative function, but 
when you are talking about a company a co rporation is a type of a company so that is the ...
