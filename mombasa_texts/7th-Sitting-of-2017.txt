HANSARD REPORT  
Wedne sday, 4th October, 2017  
The House met at 9:09a.m. 
 (Mr. Speaker  (Hon.  Aharub Ebrahim Khatri ) in the Chair)   
PRAYERS  
 
Mr. Speaker (Hon. Khatri) : Members you may be s eated. Clerk?  
MOTION  
Honorable  Member ’s, in yesterday’s  sitting we commenced on  the debate on Governor’s  
address ; today, we shall proceed with the discussion, all the persons who contributed were 
recorded and thus we shall give Members who did not contribute yesterday the opportunity to do 
so. May I again remi nd you that as you debate, please observe the rules of debate as contained in 
Part Fifteen (XV) of the Standing Orders. I hereby remind you that the official lang uages are 
English, Swahili and S ign language as provi ded for in Standing Order 73(1) , so if yo u begin a 
speech in any of the above languages, you are required to continue in the same language until the 
conclusion of your speech. Further note that, when you rise to contribute, recollect your thoughts 
and contribute conclusively as Standing Order 78 provides that no Member shall speak not more 
than once to a question except in Committee of the Whole House. Since you will be contributing 
for the first time in this Hon. House, your speech will be a maiden speech and thus no 
interruptions shall be entert ained from other Members.  It is also worth noting that since the 
Motion is brought pursuant to Standing Order 17, we have a maximum of four sitting days to 
discuss it; the second sitting of debate on the Motion being today, the floor is open. Yes Hon. 
Kibw ana.  
Hon. Kibwana Swaleh:  Thank Mr. Speaker for giving me this opportunity, am Hon. 
Kibwana Swaleh Baya representing Miritini Ward. Hon. Speaker I do con cur with the speech of 
the G overnor on the very issue that he’s touched as he starts the  second term . Hon. Speaker you 
are aware that the youth issue is a very important  issue and I am glad that it is one of the agenda 
that Hon. Governor is tackling , the issue of unemployment. Hon. Speaker the unemployment 
issue in Mombasa C ounty is like a bombshell  because  most of the youths that voted for us are 
still jobless and through the County Revolving Fund I think it is an area that we should come out 
with a policy that will be able to s ee that the funds  are fairly distributed in all W ards. Hon. 
Speaker I think the Revolving F und if the Assembly  adopts or come s with a policy clarif ying that 
the jobless people or the target youth are getting loans without being subjected to vigorous 
vetting I think it’s a very broad step .  
The other issue that is really challenging me is the issue of infrastructure Hon. Speaker ; 
as much as we have done a lot on infrastructure but like my area we still have traffic jam always 
or traffic congestion in our area , so I think it’s upon the County Government to facilitate and see 
that most of the Askaris  who are managing the roads can also be given time to visit  other routes 
within our County. Hon. Speaker it ’s upon us as a House to make sure that whatever has been 
said by the Governor is also being implemented  over the five years  that we have  so that  we serve 
the people of this County without fear or favor . Mr. Speaker I think all that has been said by the 
Governor will be implemented and our C ounty will be more developed and people will get the 
service. Thank you Hon. Speaker.  
(Applause)

Hon. (Ms.)  Mbura:  Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika , kwa maji na ni Feddis Mbura 
nawakilisha W odi ya Mwakirunge;  kwanza ningetoa pongezi kwa Bwana Spika kwa uchaguzi na 
pili natoa shukrani zangu kwa wenzangu na watu wa Mwakirunge wote kwa kunichagu a. Nikiwa 
naenda moja kwa moja Bwana S pika kwa hoja...  
(Interruption)  
Mr. Speaker (Hon. Khatri) : Hon. Member please can you repeat your name so that the 
Hansard can capture your name, just start again please.  
Hon. (Ms.)  Mbura:  Kwa maji na ni Feddis Mbura na wakilisha Wodi ya M wakirunge ; 
kwanza nimesema pongezi kwako kwa kuchaguliwa kuwa Spika wetu kwa uchaguzi na pili 
natoa shukrani zangu kwa watu wa Mwakirunge kwa kunichagua kuja kuwa wakilisha . Kwanza 
nitapongeza  Gavana wetu jinsi alivyoweza kutoa hotuba yak e ambayo kusema kweli 
imelenganishwa na zile shida ambazo ziko mashinani. Mheshimiwa Spika kwanza kabisa upande 
wa vijana hili jambo nalipongeza na ni jambo ambalo halianzi saa hii lilianza muda wa nyuma ; 
mimi kwangu ni kwamba wakati vijana wanapopata ujuz i ama wanafunzwa kuwa na ujuzi basi 
wakati huo Mheshimi wa Gavana aweze kuhusisha zile W odi ambazo ziko mbali na wakati watu 
wanapoenda mashinani w aende hao w alimu kwenda kufundisha wale vijana  kwa sababu kama ni 
kuchagua vijana kuwakilisha basi vijana weng i huwa wanaachika nyuma haswa kwa upande wa 
Mwakirunge kwa sababu wengi huwa wanashindikana kwa upande wa fedha.  
Tukienda kwa upande wa mazingira, kusema kweli mazingi ra ya Mwakirunge kama 
tunavyoju a kwamba taka zote zinazoleka kutoka Mombasa huwa zinapel ekwa Mwakirunge na 
katika hotuba ya Gavana pale sikuona kama kuna jambo ambalo limefanyika Mwakirunge . Kwa 
hio ni ombi langu kwamba wakati kama anatekeleza hii hotuba basi aweze kuangalia pale 
Mwakirunge ambako taka zote za M ombasa  zinapelekwa na ombi lang u ni kwamba tunaomba 
tinga katika bajeti ambayo itaendekezwa, kuwe na tinga hususan la Mwakirunge kwa sababu 
tinga la kule huwa linasimama mara moja ama linakaa siku mbili tatu na wakati mvua ikinyesha 
ile barabara huziba , magonjwa kuenea Mwakirunge na pia  katika ile ile sekta ya taka tukaweze 
kupata sera ambazo zitaweza kubunisha kazi kwa vijana wa Mwakirunge na hata kina mama kwa 
sababu taka ni mali.  
Tukienda kwa upande wa afya, sekta ya afya kusema kweli Mwakirunge, kwanza wacha 
nimpongeze Gavana kwa ku tuwekea hospitali kubwa katika sehemu ya Mwakirunge na pia 
katika hospitali ile tunaomba vile katika hotuba yake ni kwamba ataboresha hospitali, basi ombi 
langu ni kwamba aanze kuboresha hospitali ya Mwakirunge kwa sababu ni changamoto nyingi 
ambazo tunazi pata haswa kina mama. M ama akianza kujifungua basi huwa ni shida Mheshimiwa 
Spika, mama humgharimu mtoto anatoka na aweze kuwekwa kwa pikipiki alet we Coast General, 
hilo ni jambo la kusikitisha na pia ni jambo ambalo limeacha wa mama wengi wamepoteza 
maish a, limeacha watoto wengi wamepoteza maisha .  
Kwa hio apate kuliangalia ama tukapate kuliangalia sote kulingana na sera ambazo 
tutazitengeneza hapa Bungeni, pia nikilinganisha na sekta ya barabara, hiyo nitailinganisha 
pamoja na sekta ya afya kwa sababu mama  anapotaka kujifungua zile barabara zetu kusema 
kweli Mwakirunge ndio yenye barabara chafu katika Kaunti ya Mombasa. Kwa hio ningeomba 
Mheshimiwa Spika wakati Mheshimwa Gavana anapoangalia mambo ya barabara basi 
ashirikiane na serikali yetu kuu ili ile bar abara kuanzia Mshomoron i mpaka Mwakirunge ambapo 
ndio W odi ya mwisho ama ya mwanzo ya Kaunti ikaweze kuangaliwa kwa ufasaha.  Pia 
nikiongea kuhusu mambo ya barabara hivyo hivyo za mashinani, hakika wakati mwingi kama 
wamama wataka kujifungua ama wazee ni wa gonjwa ama watoto ni wagonjwa na kukiwa na 
mvua, basi wakaaji wa Mwakirunge hulazimika kubebwa kwenye vitanda na kuletwa barabarani.  
October 4, 2017                 MOMBASA COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                               7 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 3 Hilo ni jambo la kusikitisha, kwa hio hili jambo nilipoliona kwamba Gavana amegusa 
kuhusu mambo ya usafiri na mambo ya afy a katika hii hotuba yake nilishukuru kwa sababu 
nilijua kwamba hata Mwakirunge pia wataweza kupata hizo huduma.  
Tatu ni mambo ya maji, kusema kweli Mwakirunge kuna sehemu zengine hawapati maji 
kuanzia Januari mpaka Disemba, Mheshimiwa Spika ningeomba wakat i hili swala la maji 
linapoangaliwa litoe mtazamo mkubwa katika sehemu ya Mwakirunge kwa sababu inagharimu 
wa kina mama kukesha kwa visima n a hizo hali zimepitwa na wakati. W anakesha kwa visima, 
wengine wanabakwa, watoto badala ya kwenda shule wanakesha kw a visima wakifika 
madarasani wanalala. Kwa hio mimi ningeomba hili suala la maji tuweze kulimulika katika 
sehemu ya Mwakirunge ili watoto waweze kusoma kwa wakati na wa mama pia zile kazi zao 
ziwe rahisi.  
Tukienda katika sekta ya elimu, elimu kwanza nampo ngeza Bwana Gavana kwa sababu 
amechangia mahali pa kubwa upande wa elimu na basari. Ombi langu ni kwamba elimu inaanza 
kwa chekechea, ile basari atakapopata akiwa shule ya upili, kwanza ni lazima awe amepata 
msingi katika shule za chekechea na ombi langu n i kwamba Gavana akawez e kumiliki elimu ya 
chekechea kwa sababu watoto wengi haswa sehemu ya Mwakirunge wanaanza kuchelewa ama 
mtoto anaenda shule akiwa ana umri mkubwa, kwanza kwa sababu ya umbali wa mashule za 
chekechea na pili wakati anapoenda shule mtot o yule basi huwa anakatizwa katizwa na mambo 
ya karo ya shule ama mambo ya mshahara wa walimu. Kwa hio ningeomba pia katika hichi 
kipengele hawa walimu wa chekechea waweze kupewa kipao mbele ili misingi ya watoto 
ikaweze kurutubika tukifika mambo ya shule ya upili tupate dalili nzuri na watoto wenye umri 
mzuri wa  kufika shule ya upili.  
Kwa upande wa sekta ya mashamba, hili jambo pia nitaongea kuhusu Mwakirunge 
kwamba kuna  hati za mashamba  ambazo zilipeanwa Mwakirunge, lakini kusema kweli  hati za 
ardhi  zile wa tu hawajui mahali kwao na imekua ni changamoto s ana katika sehemu ya 
Mwakirunge. K wa hio upande wa mashamba na mambo ya scheme  ningeomba Mheshimiwa 
Spika kupitia Bwana Gavana hili jambo likaweze kuangaliwa kwa ujasiri na likaweze kupawa 
kipao mbele ili wat u waweze kuonyeshwa mashamba yao, wakishika hati za ardhi  iwe ni hati za 
ardhi  na kujua pale mahali ambapo mtu ame wekezwa.  
Mwisho ni sekta ya kilimo , kusema kweli sikuweza kuiona katika hotuba ya Gavana, 
ningeomba kwa upande wetu wa Mwakirunge, Bamburi na zile sehemu zingine tumetegemea 
kilimo na kama haitakuwepo basi pia sisi tutakuwa katika hali ya maswali ikiwa kwa hilo jambo 
pia kama sekta ya kilimo Bwana Gavana akaweze pia kulitilia mkazo na hata wakati 
tutakapotengeza sera hapa ndani tukaweze kuiweka ndani ili wale watu ambao wanaishi katika 
zile sehemu ambazo wanaweza kulima na kupata uchumi ama kama wanawekeza uchumi sawa 
sawa basi tukaweze kupata na pia tunahitaji matinga katika zile sera tukapate matinga ambayo 
yatakuwa ni ya kudumu kwa zile sehemu  watu wanaweza kulima na kupata mazao kupunguza 
umasikini katika sehemu tofauti tofauti.  
Nikimalizia ni kwamba tukaweze kushirikiana sisi pamoja na Mheshimiwa Spika na 
Gavana ili haya yote ambayo Gavana anatazamia yafanyike yaweze kufanyika kupitia  kwetu sisi 
kwa sababu kule mashinani jambo likifanyika kama mimi ama mwenzangu hajui, basi watu 
huwa wanatuuliza, kama hatujui sisi itakuwa ni ngumu. Ahsanteni sana na Mungu awabariki.  
(Applause)  
Mr. Speaker (Hon. Khatri) : Ahsante, Yes, Hon. Mwaka.   
Hon. (Ms.)  Bakari: Nashukuru sana Bwana Spika, kwa majina naitwa Mheshimiwa Mwaka 
Bakari ikiwezekana hutumia kibwag izo changu ni Mama Mwaka Mwaka h uu kutoka Wodi ya 
Timbwani.   
October 4, 2017                 MOMBASA COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                               7 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 4 La kwanza ningependa kushukuru wakaazi wa Timbwani huko waliko, shukrani zangu 
wazipate  ama wazipokee kwa dhati kwa kunipatia kura nyingi sana ambazo kwamba 
hazijapatikana kwa upande wa watu wa Likoni ambazo kwamba wamenipa wakaazi wa 
Timbwani hizo shukrani zote ziwafikie.  
Pili, ningependa kuregesha s hukrani kwa watu wa Mombasa na wote waka azi wa 
Mombasa na viongozi ambao tuko hapa kutafuta kura za Gavana ambaye ameregeshwa tena kwa 
miaka tena mitano ili aweze kutekeleza ndoto yake au malengo aliyo  nayo ya Kaunti yetu ya 
Mombasa, pia nataka kuchangia yale ambayo Mheshimiwa Gavana ambayo kwam ba 
ameyazungumzia wakati ule wa ufunguzi rasmi wa Bunge hili alipotoa hotuba yake ya tarehe 
26/9/2017  ambayo kwamba kuna kitu chengine ambacho nataka kukianzia ambacho kwamba 
alisema , we deliver the promise  ama ahadi na kutekeleza. Kwa kusema kweli ule wak ati tulikuwa 
tunatembea wakati kutafuta kura tulitumia lugha nzuri za kupendeza za kuwaahidi watu  ili 
waweze ku tupitisha na kwetu tuko hapa hiyo basi ni zile ahadi tuzitekeleze ambazo zatekelezwa 
na hili Bunge letu na Mheshimiwa Spika tukiwa pamoja na Gavana  wetu ambao kwamba kule 
kwangu tuliahidi na kidogo tukaanza mradi wa barabara, barabara ile tuliyoianza tuliianza wakati 
tunaanza siasa mpaka sasa ile barabara imesimama ambapo jukumu hili ninaulizwa na wakaazi 
wa Timbwani, barabara mbona haimaliziki ama m likuwa mnatupamba tu. Kwa hio Mheshimiwa 
Spika ninaomba wakati wa bajeti zetu ili hii barabara iweze kumalizwa na zile ambazo 
zimebakia ambazo kwamba tulienda na Gavana raundi tukaziangalia pia ziweze kutekelezwa 
zimalizike.  
Jengine ambalo pia Bwana Joho alizungumzia ni ukurasa wa saba kuhusiana na vijana 
wenzangu na kila mtu hapa ameongea kulingana na vijana na ajira na kuwapatia ujuzi vijana. 
Kweli hiyo ni sawa na ni mu himu sana kufanya jambo kama hilo lakini kwangu Timbwani ndio 
kumekuwa ngome  ya wakali  kwanza  ambao kwamba sasa hivi kuna shida sana na vijana ambao 
kwamba wanajiita wajukuu wa bibi , sijui watoto wa nyanya vitu kama hivyo. Kwa hio yote ni 
kukosa ajira na kukosa mwelekeo au mafundisho fulani ama kupatiwa ujuzi ili waweze kuacha 
tabia kama hi zo. Nataka kuongezea kipengele hicho ambacho kwamba nimeang alia kurasa zote 
sikuona mama akitajwa na akitajwa kijana huwa umetaja mama na kina mama na biashara 
sikuziona , nimeona mambo ya biashara lakini sikuona mama akizungumzwa . Hivyo basi  kama  
mama nime ona afadhali pia nilizungumzie, kina mama na ajira ndogo ndogo hizi wanapata 
taabu. Kama kwetu Likoni, Likoni feri utakuta kina mama wako pale, wamepanga biashara zao 
kwa vibaraza pale, masahani ya samaki , kaimati , wanafanya biashara, wale kina mama pale 
tunawa lipisha zile pesa pale na kwa ku sema kweli ni sawa kwa Kaunti yetu kuongeza kipato 
chetu lakini pia tunatakikana tuwatizame wale  kina ma ma makaazi ambayo wanakaa si ma kaazi 
ambayo ni sawa, mvua ni yao, jua ni lao na ile mikato wanakatwa. Kwangu mimi n asema kama 
kiongozi wa Timbwani , kama kiongozi na mimi ni mama naona jambo kama hili Bwana Spika 
lijadiliwe sana ili kina mama wapate usaidizi.  
Napenda kuongelelea tena kipengele cha ukurasa wa 12 ambacho ni cha elimu, kweli 
Elimu ni kiungo msingi  kwa jamii, kuna mambo ambayo yanafanyika kwa upande wa masuala 
ya basari . Mheshimiwa Spika Gavana alizungumzia kuhusu  basari, basari kweli tunazipata na 
kabla sijakuwa kiongozi mimi kama Mwaka niliku wa katika kitengo cha Ward Sub -County 
Develop ment Fund. Basari zile zikitolewa Kaunti ya Mombasa , kipao mbele wanaopewa ni 
Ward Adminisrators ; Ward Administrators  wakipewa basari zile huenda kukaa na wazee wa 
mitaa ambao kwamba wanaweza kuzigawanya zile basari kupitia wazee wa mitaa.  
 
 
October 4, 2017                 MOMBASA COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                               7 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 5 Leo hii kama ma ma Mwaka , kiongozi wa Timbwani, m zee wa mtaa akipewa basari 
ukumbuke mwananchi atanifuata mimi kutaka basari, basari amepewa mzee wa mtaa agawanye 
na mzee wa mtaa ukimpatia basari yeye atakwenda kukaa na familia yake, atapeana familia kwa 
ujum la hataona umuh imu wa yule mwananchi. Kwa hio naomba kwa upande wa basari itiliwe 
maanani na tupewe kipao mbele sisi kama viongozi tuangalie basari ile inamlenga nani ambaye 
ni muhitaji zaidi?  
(Applause)  
...Jengine napenda kuzungumzia kuhusiana na ECD ; kama kwangu Timbwa ni ni W odi 
kubwa sana na hakuna hata shule ya chekechea, waka azi wote wa Timbwani wanapata shida 
sana kupeleka watoto shule za chekechea , kwa shule zile za jamii ambapo huku kwetu Timbwani 
Mheshimiwa Spika kuna shida ya shule za chekechea ambapo watu wanape leka watoto wao 
kwenye shule za jamii na wao ni masikini ambao kwamba hawatow eza kumiliki jambo kama 
hili. Mimi kama mama Mwaka nilikuwa ni mwalimu wa ECD ninajua shida zile ambazo ziko 
katika jamii ambao wazazi wao hawana uwezo wa kupeleka katika zile shule ambazo wanaziita 
ni Academy  lakini si Academy  ni nyumba tu , chumba tu , ni nyumba tu ya mtu anafanya ni 
Academy  na analipisha watoto pesa nyingi. Kwa hio naomba katika bajeti yetu ile itapitishwa na 
Gavana ama itazungumziwa na mimi naomba Timbwani ku we na chekechea angalau watoto 
waweze kusoma vizuri na wapate elimu nzuri kwa sababu huwezi kuweka msingi uka weka 
udongo halafu juu yake uweke jiwe, kutaporomoka. Hivyo basi  tuwapatie msingi ambao 
utakuwa mzuri hata huko juu tukiweka udongo hiyo nyumba ita kuwa imara na itasimama, nataka 
nikomee hapo kwa yale mengine yote ambayo nimezungumza na viongozi wenzangu, sisi wote 
ni kama mapapai likidungwa moja, linatoa utovu, tuwe kitu kimoja na tuweze kushirikiana. 
Ahsante.  
(Applause)  
Mr. Speaker (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you , yes Honorable…  
Hon. (Ms.)  Ngare : Thank you Mr. Speaker for according me this chance to also ai r my 
views on Governor’s Speech.  I am Hon. Milka Moraa Ngare , Nominated  MCA , I first want to 
take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the Go vernor Ali Hassan Joho on his re -
election for the second term to run this great County. And I also want to take this opportunity to 
thank you Mr. Speaker for your new role which is very essential in this Assembly  and I  wish you 
all the best and of course  congratulation s are also in order fo r the Deputy Speaker, Majority 
Leader, Chief Whip for their new roles, added roles which I am also very sure they are very 
important and I will not forget my fellow Hon. Members; El ected and nominated like myself  for 
whic h am truly and grateful to my Governor and the Party at large a nd also the Chairman of our 
Party who am sure plays a great role in running the affairs of our Party in this County.  Now I 
want to also put my voice to the Governor’s speech which was highly tr ansformative by the way 
on the service delivery to the people of Mombasa.  
The speech laid emphasis on self governance, encouraging appreciation of diversity, and 
echoing accountable exercise of powers. Remarkably the speech of His Excel lence the Governor 
is keen to  see that as  County leaders we should continuously engage with our stakeholders,  who 
are the citizen s, value their input in our decision making which at the  end is also going to impact  
on their lives and on their activities that they will be carrying out.  As a professional teacher I 
would also want to talk about that particular area, it is good to note that the Governor asked as to 
do what is called servant leadership approach and in line with his campaign manifesto he didn’t 
talk about education which is also enshr ined in  our constitution , I think Article 4 3 (a), 47 thank 
you my daughter.  
October 4, 2017                 MOMBASA COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                               7 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 6 So it is appreciative to know the plan of creating Centers  of Excellence as a means of 
improving education standards in our County ; those of you who are professional teac hers like 
myself, know what it means to have a centre of excellence. A centre where a child will be 
accorded a conducive learning environment , be given all the conditions of learning so that, that 
child can come out very polished such that when the child g ets to higher levels of learning that 
child is ready to get ahead . So I want to say that in the centres of learning , same as excellence , 
that is Early Childhood C enters they will not be very effective if the educators for ECDE will not 
be properly trained, supervised and of c ourse  motivated , you will have be autiful centres of 
excellence but if the educator is not well motivated that educat ed he or she  is not going to go 
through. Where? So I would ask when we sit into our C ommi tties those who will be in the 
Committee of E ducation that will legislate to bring and pass Bills which are going to make sure 
that the educators and the learners are well catered for as per the Governor’s  Speech.  
The Governor also talked about post secondary programs for deserving and needy 
learners to high institutions of learning and I want to say that the collapse of education is a 
collapse of a nation. Edu cation is a developer of all these  other t hings that we are talking about , 
so when you have a well educated society development w ill automatically come. Education 
cannot be attained fully  without and sending all other proposals outside by His Excellency the 
Governor like infrastructure, improve the health care, sanitation and security, we can some time 
see children where I live at U tange, young children wading through dirty water you wonder by 
the time this child gets to class what is going to become of this child? So all these  other things 
that we are talking about will eventually be achieved if we have a well educated society and a lso 
where there is security for the children to enjoy learning in an environment that is very secure.  I 
will refer you that I saw a clip in Nyalenda in Kisumu when children were tear gased and nothing 
actually …I think it was a nursery school and those kid s came up traumatised so if there is no 
security in our area or in our society how do you expect such kind of children to learn? They will 
be traumatised forever and they might not even want to come to school. So as a teacher I fully 
support when the Gover nor says that he has plans for security and those plans when we set up 
our C ommittees we will actualize them year by year by debating on them and passing Bills 
because p lans without an execution frame work are about to collapse or to fail and when the 
Gover nor talked about, I want to support my fellow Hon. Member Mwaka who talked about 
women ; the government to promote the ir empowerment , if you want a society to develop then 
empower women, empower women because behind every successful  man ther e's a woman…   
(Applause)  
...women are mover s of the economy.  
(Applause)  
...and if you look in society these days where there’s a  strong woman, where there  is an  
educated wom an, where there's a woman whose voice is heard development goes on. So can we 
learn to  empower our mothers, our girls and all the women in general then you will realize 
development.   
(Applause)  
...Finally I want to say I know many of my collegues have talked about the youth s, the 
youth s are very active and they are the majority and I know youth is a workshop of sin so we 
must engage the youth as per the Governor said that we will do programs which are going to 
make them be active, be involve d so that their mind s are occupied some where so that they don’t 
think of going to do evil , so that we remo ve that idle workshop from their minds.  
 
October 4, 2017                 MOMBASA COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                               7 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 7 I would not want to continue talking because I know my Hon. Member ha ve equal ly 
important points but I want to wish all the Hon. Members in this House good legislation and a 
good five years term whereby we are going to add value to this House and we come out as an 
excellent House that w ill work hard to improve the liv es of the people of Mombasa.   
(Applause)  
Mr. Speaker (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Hon. Osongo . 
Hon. (Ms.)  Osongo:  Thank you Mr. Speaker Sir for giving me this opportunity to s peak 
in this Assembly .  First of all I thank my Lord for giving me life until today so that I will be in 
this Assembly  and give my views. I also thank Mr. Speaker Sir and I pray for that you may 
prosper and God may give you wisdom the way he gave Solomon.  
(Applause)  
...Mr. Speaker Sir I am also thankful to the party that has nominated me to be one of the 
MCA s in this Assembly . My names are Mary Everlyn Osongo , a nominated MCA so I go 
directly to the speech that our Governor Hon. Hassan Ali Joho talked about ; first what has 
touched me alot and the most imp ortant is the drainage system, in my W ard there is poor 
drainage system although Hon. Joho has really worked for it. If you walk along the road you will 
find some drainage works but it was do ne poorly because  if it rains the drainage gets blocked, 
and the rain water becomes seasonal lakes and many people die, they suffer because of th at poor 
drainage . So Mr. Speaker Sir I was  requesting for each and every W ard whether we may dig 
drainages towards  the sea level so that when it rains the water can find a  way of going to the sea , 
and not accumulating and affecting people and maroonin g them inside their homes.  
Mr. Speaker Sir the second point is education I also thank Hon. Joho for the work he has 
done for his first term by building some primary s chools in the County but most  of our children 
don't get g ood education because of lack of teachers in the schools , and  that is why you find 
many private schools are being made in t he houses so as to help these other children but there are 
some that don't have money for p aying for those private schools. S o Mr. Sp eaker Sir we should 
look into those things, we should look so much on them when we are budgeting let us add 
teachers , the P1 teachers are so many and they are crying and even I support my colleague who  
said tha t from right now when there are employment opportunities  they only choose those who 
have worked for five years and above but these young people are very brilliant  and they can 
work effectively because they want to be in those schools but those who  have experience don't 
engage them in their work so much because they are saying that they know that work . So Mr. 
Speaker we should be budgeting for even our youths , we may employ them so that they may be 
employed they help the primary schools that do not have enough teachers so that our children 
could  prosper and we should have good quality education through hard work .  
Mr. Speaker Sir the other point is employment, infact if you walk in the County you get 
most people are not employed but it's the House that can enact  Bills for those people, even the 
youth s, the women to get employment, am saying this because if we can make arrangement s 
even with our youth s like now we find our environment is very dirty, there are heaps  everywhere 
but if we can use our youths to collect we g ive them even containers every house in our W ards 
we give them containers to remove the garbage  and then our youth s can collect even twice a 
week and  they get paid, that is also an employment to the youth s. So Mr. Speake r Sir I think that 
one can be done even we can supply our youth s with handcarts  so that they transport th e 
gargabe… . 
(Applause and laughter)  
...Another  point the Hon. Governor talked about is roads, infact on the side of roads he 
has really worked .

DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor  Page 8 I appreciate him and I congratulate him for the work that has been done , it is only a few 
places that roads have not been made so when we are budgeting at least we should look at such  
things so that we get good roads, g ood transportation because where there is a business  there 
should be good roads, a business cannot be good in an area or any place where there is 
development there's good roads because of transportation, and when there are bad roads there 
will be no transportatio n and the goods will not be delivered at the correct time . My last but not 
least point is on security, Hon. Governor has really tried on the side of security and I 
congratulate him for that but we still need more forces on that part of security because wh ere 
there's security there's development. You see like in t he area where am coming from in the W ard, 
am between Junda and Magogoni and in those places you can't do your business even at night or 
if you do it is at your own risk , you can't walk at night beca use it is at your own risk . So I think 
when we are budgeting we should look into those things; the police should patrol  the areas and 
be in civilian to enable business and security. You will find some times  when you wake up you 
find a person is killed, that person was going to work at 5 :00a.m or he was coming back at 
5:00a.m because there are some jobs that people do work un til night or they have to wake up 
very early because they don't have enough money to reach where they are going , so you find 
them being killed on the way . So with those few remarks, I think if we join hands together we 
work together and our County will be an excellent County if all of us are together and we pray 
that God may make us and give us wisdom to make our people happy the way we promised 
them. Thank you Mr. Speaker Sir and be blessed.   
(Applause)  
Mr. Speaker (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Hon. Faith .  
Hon.  (Ms.)  Mwende:  Thank you Mr. Speaker my name is Faith Mwende Boniface , 
MCA for Kipevu Ward. First of all I would like to thank Almighty God for enabling us to be 
here today, secondly I would like to congratulate you for your election to lead this House and I 
would like also to congratulate the Hon. Members who are in this House representing different 
Wards and also I would not forget to congratulate my people of Kipevu Ward who put trust and 
faith without minding the political party which I come from , without  minding my age and elected 
me to represent them in this House for these five years .  
To the speech of the Governor , am very honoured because am one of the people who 
conducted the survey of Vision 2035 of Mombasa County and as seen we are doing something to 
achieve the goals of expectations of the people which represent Mombasa County . I was touched 
more with the first agenda of Hon. Governor ; the youth agenda , as we all know the youth are the 
largest composition of our society and they feel being  neglected because most of them don't have 
employment . You may have qualifications but if you go to seek any employment you will be 
asked to have an experience of five years plus, that means by the time I get employed I will be 
no longer a youth, there i s need to put measures  despite that i know we hav e a revolving fund for 
the County Government of Mombasa but giving these youths Kshs. 100,000 a group of ten Kshs. 
100,000 without giving them knowledge on what they will do wit h that money , it's like giving 
them , I can say something to kill them because if a youth is given Kshs. 100,000 without the 
knowledge of doing any business and I just call my friend we go to a pub we drink that money 
and by the end of  the day it will be needed back .  
So there's need for benchmark ing as Hon. Members we consider also some youths in our 
respective Counties  to be taken for benchm arking in some other developed Counties or countries 
to know how they can use that money well … we consider also some youth in our respective 
wards to be taken for benchmarki ng in some other develop ed Counties or countries to know how 
they can use that money well …

...When I come to environmental issues Mombasa County is in bad state despite that we 
invested a lot of money to buy trucks to dump the garbage , but when you are being stuck in 
Kibarani I ur ge this House to propose every Ward to at least ha ve two trucks as the people who 
collect garbage can have somewhere where they can dump th e garbag e… 
(Applause)  
...Mr. Speaker the only thing as you come from the Ai rport which welcomes you to 
Mombasa Island is the bad smell instead of being welcomed by good music, traditional dances of 
our Swahili culture  that is the only smell which welcome us as we pass Kibarani coming to the 
Island . 
So we have to do something and t he County must invest heav ily in environment issues 
because one scholar said , if you want to cultivate peace you want to protect the environment . If 
the environment is not clean there's no way we will have peace in our County, if we have clean 
environment we wi ll not spend a lot of money going to hospitals so we have to look on those 
issues who ever or the Committee which will be the head of the environmental issues.   
The third agenda of the Governor’s ' speech about security we sh ould take drastic 
measures to enhance our security in our County but we have a lot of challenges in terms of the 
streetlights ; when you go to the yard you will be told the vehicles do  not have fuel, I don't know 
the bulbs are not there and you know the ci tizens ha ve a lot of expectations from us . When you 
go and tell the citizens that our vehicles  do not have fuel to go and  maintain  the street  lights, 
what are you telling them and you are their representative? So we should also put measures on 
that. I want to be very  brief because I know the Hon. Members do  not want to waste a lot of time .  
 The fourth agenda is water and sanitation ; Mr. Speaker the sewer blockage in Mombasa 
County and everyone can bear me witness it is in very bad state,  we urge every institution to be 
reliable  on what they are employed to do . For example where I come from I have never even 
seen any development, I cannot say there is something  which can make me smile; the drainage is 
a mess in Kipevu Ward and if I can remember when I was on the other side  I used to post a lot of 
pictures, children are swamped  in every time it rains so we to put measures or something on that 
issue. About toilets yes there's a need to build the public toilets and in connection with that we 
should also consider to have public toilets.  
The fifth one was health , we should not lie to ourselves, our hospitals do  not have enough 
medicine, we see strike here and there so I may propose if we can have at least in every Ward we 
have a  mobile clinic and be equipped well and have the doctors to attend to ou r people. There's 
something which touch ed me more , the education sector . Mr. Speaker where I come from I have 
two public schools ; Kwa Hola Primary and Umoja Primary , when I talk about Kwa Hola Primary 
the building, the ECD of Kwa Hola Primary is buil t with iron sheet s, you know our weather in 
Mombasa yo u can imagine small kids in tha t iron sheet s building from ground to roof  when it 
reaches at 10:00am the children are taken under a tree because they can't afford to learn in that 
situation and I believe that the E CD is among the core function s of the County despite that you 
want to put more effort in giving bursary to secondary schools we should also focus on our 
function as the devolved function . ECDs schools are in a bad state and there are no enough ECD  
teachers  and most of them are qualified and you find a teacher is being paid Kshs. 4 ,000; if you 
give the teacher Kshs. 4000 what do you expect?  
Mr. Speaker Sir the business sector am very happy to hear the Governor saying he will 
consider the regulation and deduction of lev ies and  taxes . Mr. Speaker Sir to operate a business 
here in Mombasa is very expensive ; the Single Business Permit are very high compared to other 
Counties and we should vis it other Counties and compare the rates , high rates discourage people

10 from  investing or operating businesses some of those opt to give Askaris  Kshs 200. So I have th e 
solution of this Assembly ; that if we lowered the rate we know we have Uwezo Fund, we have 
affirmative action most people will create job opportunities and will invest in businesses and 
most of them will never be scared to open a business because license is not that expensive.  
Public works , that is infrastructure Mr. Speaker , in Kipevu Ward I can say we have 
minimal access roads , it is a Ward which does not  have even a social hall, it is a W ard which I 
don't know if the land was grabbed or what but there is no open space  for development . So there  
is need to go to  that Ward and to make them have to think , otherwise if we will be having a n Eid 
Baraza we will go to the neighbouring Wards like Changamwe , don't we have a space where we 
can have a social hall ? So we should consider t he youth of Kipevu as they are part of us and that  
should be acted upon , I reme mber in 2014 I par ticipated in public participation and propose d that 
as a common mwananchi up to date it has never been enacted.  
When I come to the Tourism sector I have seen w hat Mr. Governor has said but we 
should also not neglect the existing tourism sectors like Akamba Handicraft which is in 
Changamwe , I have so m uch to contribute but let me reach there and thank you for giving me 
this opportunity. Thank you , Mr. Speaker.  
(App lause)  
Mr. Speaker (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Honorable.   
Hon. Thoya: Ahsante sana Mheshimiwa Spika.  Majina yangu ni Juma Renson Thoya , 
ukipenda zaidi niite BMW , nashukuru kuweza kunipa  fursa hii kuchangia hotuba ya Gavana . 
Kabla sijaendelea ningependa kuchukua nafasi hii ku kupongeza kwa kupata na fasi hii kuwa 
kiongozi wa Jumba hili , ningependa pia kumpongeza Gavana kwa kupata kura nyingi zaidi 
kuliko mwaka wa 2013 ikiashiria kwamba yeye ndio rais 2022…  
(Applause)  
…Nawapongeza Wabunge walioweza kupata nafasi. ..aidha kwa kuchaguliwa ama  
kuteuliwa kujiunga kwa Jumba  hili kutengeneza sheria , nawapongeza watu wa Mikindani ambao 
walinichagua kwa wingi nataraji kwamba takriban watu elfu tisa wana matarajio zaidi kuyabeba 
lakini imani yangu ni kwamba  sihitaji kitambi nahitaji Mwenyezi Mungu kuweza kutoa huduma 
hizo na nina amini Mungu atanitangulia katika utoaji wa huduma hizo . Hotuba ya Gavana iligusa 
kwa kiwango kikubwa na endapo sisi kama Wajumbe  tuta jukumika kusimama na kutekeleza 
hotuba hii nafikiri Mombasa haitakuwa pale ilipokuwa siku za nyuma…  
(Applause)  
Ni hotu ba ambayo wengi wamesema ni ya Gavana lakini mimi nataka kur ekebisha 
kwamba hotuba hii ni y a rais mtarajiwa kwa sababu i po katika kiwango hicho sio ya Gavana tu . 
(Applause)  
Mahali paliponiguza zaidi ni m ahali paliangazia kuhusu vijana , wengi wako maska ni na 
hapo ni mahali ambapo wengi hawana ajira na  yale yanayotendeka pale sio ya kibinadamu , si 
mambo ya k awaida ipo haja tujipange kama Jumba la uteng enezaji sheria kuwaondoa pale a thari 
za vijana kutokua na k azi zinaenda leta shida katika Kaunti hii ya Mo mbasa . Athari hizo 
zikiunganisha umasikini , utumiaji wa mihadarati , mapenzi ya kiholela  holela na mwishowe 
kupata magonjwa ipo haja tujitokeze na miradi , kuna baadhi ya hawa vijana wana  masomo , 
ambao wana ujuzi lakini nataka niongeze kwamba kuna vijana amba o wana nguvu kwa sababu 
hatutawabagua waliosoma , ambao wana  ujuzi wale ambao hawana ujuzi hawakusoma wanaweza 
tumia nguvu zao kupata riziki zao , (??) ni mmoja wa wale wa athiriwa  katika Mikindani ukifika 
pale Bangladesh utawaona kuanzia saa mbili mpaka saa tano za usiku wako maska ni sasa 
wataendelea kutafuna mgokaa na miraa mpaka jioni .

11 Lakini ikifika saa tano tujipange kwa sababu vijana wana weza kuwa wazuri na wabaya 
zaidi . Sasa singependa kuwa waliotoka kazini wa weze kuchinjwa shingo tuangalie ni vipi 
tutawapa ajira, ni kitu gani ambacho tuna weza fanya vijana hawa badala ya kukaa bure wa weze 
kuwa na ajira fulani si ati , kuna sehemu mbili kule Mikindani ambazo ziko katika hatari na 
nilikuwa napendekeza kama wale vijana tungeweza kuwa wekea kama  pahali pa kuegesha magari  
na tufungue mir adi ya kuosha magari katika kila sehemu  ama zile mashine.   
(Applause)  
Katika mazingira inatambulika Mombasa kama mji wa utalii lakini utalii hauwezi 
linganishwa na uchafu ; jiji letu lina shida , lina taka na ipo haja tuweze kuja n a mbinu kabambe 
kuona kwamba kutoka kule ndege zinatoa , kutoka baharini kuingia ndani ya kisiwa cha 
Mombasa sehemu zote zinakuwa safi na tunaweza kufanya hivi ikiwa idara husika ya usafi wa 
mazingira itapewa fedha za kutosha , inasikitisha sana juzi tulikuwa na zoezi ya uzoaji taka kule 
Mikindani sehemu ya kwa Mwanzini nilipofika katika idara husika walishindwa kunisaidia hata 
na vifagio na wakasema si wewe tumekataa kukusaidia na kifagio hata wale wanafagia 
barabarani wana shida . Kwa sababu h ii nachukua nafasi hii kuhimiza Wajumbe w enzagu tuweze 
kusukuma kuhakikisha kwamba fedha zimepatikana ile idara husika iweze kupata vile vifaa za 
kufanya kazi na hiyo idara peke yake haiwezi maliza kazi ni sisi sote tuweze kutangamana 
tuhakikishe uchafu amba o uko W odi zetu na zaidi ya yote hat usafis hi tu na pia kuhamasisha 
watu athari za uchafu , hivi nilikuwa naugua na Dengue  na haya yote yanatokana na uchafu , ni 
lazima tuambie watu uchafu ni magonjwa ndio malaria,  kipindi  pindu ndio Dengue  kwa sababu 
lakini sheria zetu hazina ukali unaopaswa mt u anatupa tu . Ni sawa tutunge sheria ambazo mtu 
akitupa taka katika mtaa aweze kuchukuliwa hatua sawasawa,  zaidi ya yote katika hiyo 
wanatuambia tusafishe lakini ha kuna mahali pa kutupa taka ile Mikindani nzima iko na gari moja 
tu la taka ambalo hujaa mpak a zikawekwa hapo chini , na Kibarani zimejaa tafadhali tupewe 
mabehewa amba yo taka zikijaa wana nchi wataweka taka hapo , ni vizuri kila Wodi iwe na gari ya 
kubeba takataka.   
Zaidi ya yote imeniguza upande wa bia shara ; kazi hakuna manake elimu si  ya mama 
yangu wala ya babangu na kweli vi jana tunapowawezesha wanaanzisha biashara lakini biashara 
hizi zimekuwa ni ngumu kuziendelesha kwa sababu ya unyanyapa a wa askari wa kitaifa na wa 
Kaunti ni mbio tu . Nyumba hii iweze kufikiria kwa uzito kwa sababu mimi nasema h ata kazi ya 
kuuza mnazi ni kazi , mnazi ni pombe halali lakini vile wanavyoishi ni mbio pesa wanagawana na 
anayeuza mnazi ameekeza shilingi elfu tatu , elfu mbili ni karo , askari wa kitaifa wan akuja. 
Nashukuru Kiranja wa Bunge  aliligus ia jambo hili lakini hiyo shida haik o kule Frère Town 
pekee , iko kwangu lakini shida ni wanauza mnazi katika zile saa zilizowekwa na Mututho lakini 
polisi wanakuja muda huo  ukikataa unawekwa kwa gari la polisi , unatungiwa kachupa ka lita 
mbili kama haka unaandikiwa ni chang ’aa ama u naandikiwa umekataa kutiwa mbaroni . Askari 
wetu wanachukua ushuru  wakifika hapo badala wa fanye kile kinastahili ; badala waletee Kaunti 
wakionekana maduka yamefungwa wakipita maduka yanafunguliwa ataka e patikana mi a mbili 
ziwe kwa mfuko na hapa Kaunti kazi ni ya as kari. Hii ndio kazi kila mtu anataka kwa sababu 
mshahara uwe utachelewa au hautakuja wao maisha ni mazuri yanaendelea , ni lazima tuangalie 
haya , wanatumwa endeni (??) wale vijana wanaitwa wachuuzi  ambao wanatafuta riziki zao 
hakuna mahali pa kwenda . Juzi nil iona kwa macho na tuko hatarini kwa sababu hatuna tofauti na 
wao ana ambiwa nenda ukabebe wachuuzi  vile anavyowabeba juu,  nasema sisi W aheshimiwa 
safari hii tutatiwa makofi , ni kuwa na taratibu ya kushika mtu hii ni Kenya ya katiba mpya si  
kule nyuma lazim a kuwe kuna heshima inaonekana lakini wanakubeba juu na hakupeleki kortini  
unapeana shilingi mia moja , mia mbili watu wapate riziki , haya ma mbo lazima yaangaliwe .

12 Mheshimiwa Spika maji ni tatizo kubwa lazima tuliangalie ; cartels , lakini si wale 
walioko nje ha ta ndani ya shirika la Mombasa Water na wanashirikiana na wale kwa sababu 
hawa hawangoji mshahara wanalipwa na wale  ma cartels  ndio tatizo halitatoka . Nasikitika 
kwamba maji ya mf ereji hayatoki lakini ya lori yanatoka gari imeja a, wengine wana unganisha 
moja kwa moja  maji tu  yanatoka wengine ni bora kuliko wengine . Ipo haja zile Kamati husika 
zitakapoundwa zichunguze hili swala kwa undani kwa sababu mimi kuna wakati nilikuwa nauza 
maji karibu nilet ewe gari nzima ya polisi nauza maji ya shilingi mbili karibu nilale ndani k wa 
sababu naharibu biashara yao , kila mwisho wa mwezi haya mambo ni lazima yaangaziwe 
vilivyo . 
Afya najua tuko na mtihani mgumu wauguzi wako katika mgomo lakini wale kidogo 
wameshikilia zile hos pitali zetu kuna mpango gani wa kuwapatia motisha ? Ukiangalia j ana 
nilifanya utafiti kutoka Kibarani hadi mataa wa nde ge kupakana na rafiki yangu hos pitali ni moja   
iko Mikindani , yule muuguzi shift yake haishi, hakuna  dawa ni lazima tuhakikis he hospitali zetu 
ni za manufaa .  
Ardhi  ni donda sugu na ninafikiria amezungu mza hapa historical injustices  ni neno la  
kizungu , ni neno la kizungu linaloma anisha g harama ya kihistoria  na kitu inaitwa na Kaunti na 
Manispaa kule kwangu Mikindani ni kugum u mpaka sasa waliji pa wenyewe vipande alafu 
wanaviuza na ushahidi upo . Saa hii u kifika Mikindani sehemu ya Maporomokoni utasikia kila 
mmoja ana karatasi na kila mmoja na aliuziwa na mtu wa Manispaa , kuna mwingine analipa 
rates leo lakini analipa karatasi lakini physically  hana ardhi, ningehimiza Nyumba hii tujipange 
tuone ni vipi ambavyo  huo wakati wa Manispaa tutarekebisha namna gani kwa sababu saa hii 
kila mmoja ana makaratasi amepewa na Manispaa hajulikani mwenyeji halisi  ni nani.  Wengine 
wanajua hii ni sehemu ya barabara halafu hiyo sehemu ya barabar a inauzwa mara mbili na mtu 
wa Kaunti, ilikuwa nipeleke tinga juzi nasema hapa n i barabara lakini  akaja mtu wa Kaunti 
akauza hapo  hapo , hayo ndio matatizo ambayo tuko nayo na iko haja tuyazingatie kwa kina . Ni 
imani yangu mengi yamezungumzwa na mengi yataendelea kuchangiwa na singependa niende 
zaidi ya hapo ni mzuri wa kuongea lakini nitachukua nafasi hii kuwapatia wenzangu ni wakati 
ambao tunatakiwa kujitoa kihekma , kutoa changizo na Miswada na kuhahikisha ile ndoto ya 
Gavana lazima itimie kupitia Bunge hili . Ahsante.
