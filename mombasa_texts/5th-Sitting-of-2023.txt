Yes, Hon ourable  Allen Katana , MCA, Shanzu Ward. Please give the Notice of Motion ? 
 
Hon. Katana:  Thank you Mr. Speaker Sir. I beg to give the following Notice of Motion . 
 
THAT AWARE  THAT  the national and county unemployment rates are at all times high 
of 40  per cent  for Kenya and 44  per cent for Mombasa County ; 
 
FURTHER AWARE  THAT  many youths and women are affected by ravaging 
unemployment phenomenon due to lack of adequate te chnical skills required in the  
competitive job market or lack skills to self -employ themselves ; 
 
COGNIZANT THAT,  the National Government has similar programs for the youth but is 
limited in scope and scale ; 
 
NOTING THAT,  youth and women are great human capi tal resource which if well 
harnessed and deployed could spur economic growth and county progress ; 
 
FURTHER NOTING TH AT, the massive training program should include life skills, ICT, 
cottage industries, entrepreneurship and other practical courses needed in the labour 
market ; 
 
CONCERNED THAT , if the ravaging unemployment and lack of technical skills is not 
seriously addre ssed at the county level, their risk surging unemployment , slow economic 
growth and attendant ripple effects and continuation of the social malaise ; 
 
 I therefore urge the assembly to  RESOLVE:  
 
THAT  the County government of Mombasa to establish a massive tr aining and up  skilling 
of technical skills programme for unemployed youth and women to address the skills gap 
and equip them for the compet itive labour market and for self -employment.  
 
Thank you, Speaker.
