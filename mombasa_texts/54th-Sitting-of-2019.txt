STATEMENTS  
RESPONSE  TO STATEMENT  ON THE  STATUS OF THE AUDITO R GENERAL ’S REPORT  
 Yes Hon. Fadhili Makarani, Chairperson Committee on Public Account s and Investment , 
please respond?  
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu ): Thank you Mr. Speaker.  
July 4 , 2019                               COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                           54 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor Page 3  Mr. Speaker as the  Chairman  of the Public Accounts Committee  of late we have received 
a report from the Auditor General a report on Revolving Fund ; also we have received a report on  
Elimu Fund, report from the Water Company for 2016/ 2017 and 2017/2018. Mr. Spea ker we are 
also in possession of a repor t from the County Assembly 2016/2017, 2017/2018, County 
Executive 2016/2017, 2017/ 2018.   
 Mr. Speaker unfortunately the Committee has not worked on these reports becaus e we 
have written to the Auditor General to resp ond if they have received any response from the 
above mentioned Departments  but so far  we have not received any  feedback from th e Office of 
the Auditor General a nd we also wrote to the Departments for them to bring responses to the 
Committee but also as I have said the Departments have failed to respond. Thank you.  
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you Hon. Makarani. So Hon. Makarani how much 
time do  you need to get the responses? C an we give you one more week to bring the response?  
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon . Mwalimu ): Mr. Speaker one week is insufficient, I will ask 
for two weeks because we have to write to the Office of the Auditor General and also the said 
Departments for them to bring the response to this Assembly and also to forward the response to 
the O ffice of the Auditor General. So please Mr. Speaker in two weeks we will respond back if 
we have received the responses from the said Departments and we also need to get status report 
from the Office of the Auditor General on the re sponses that the Departm ent sent  to their office, 
so two weeks time it will be sufficient time to this Committee.  
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you Hon. Fadhili. Yes Hon. Charles Kitula?  
 The Chief Whip  (Hon. Kitula) : Mheshimiwa Spika nimemsikiza Mwenyekiti wa Public 
Accounts  Committee  (PAC ) na Public Investment Committee , (PIC) na ameweza kusema 
kwamba waliweza kutoa barua kwa Executive  lakini hawajapata jawabu lolote kutok a kwa 
Executive Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti . 
 Langu na la kushangaza ni kwamba ni hatua gani watachukua kama K amati Mheshimiwa 
Mwenyekiti , wakati  kulingana na Financial Statement ya 2017/ 2018  tuliweza kupata na 
kulingana na Katiba  na kipengele 229 (8), within three months after receiving an Audit Report, 
Parliament or the County Assembly shall debate and consider the report and take appropriate 
action . Lakini la kushangaza Mheshimiwa Spika mimi nina uhakika  ya kwamba  Kamati hii 
haijakua na kikao na kama wamefanya kikao watupatie kumbukumbu za mkutano tuweze 
kuziangalia walikaa lini na wakaweza kuleta mapendekezo ga ni ka ma Kamati Mheshimiwa 
Mwenyekiti?  Ahsante sana.  
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you Hon. Charles Kitula. Yes Hon. Mwamwiri?  
 Hon. Athman Mwamwiri:  Ahsant e Mheshimwa Spika. Mheshimiwa Spika kwa mujibu 
wa K anuni na muda waliopewa Kamati husika ilipaswa  kuwa miezi mitatu  (3) na kumbukumbu 
yangu kama haijanipotosha walipewa majukumu haya tarehe 21/11/2018, kufikia sasa wana zaidi 
ya miezi sita.  
 Kwa hivyo kuitisha wiki mbili kama ndani ya miezi sita hawakutekeleza yaliyostahiki 
hata wiki mbili ni mchezo n a kupoteza muda wa Bunge  hili lako tukufu kwa muda ambao 
hawataweza kuyatekeleza wanayodai wataweza kuyatekeleza.  
July 4 , 2019                               COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                           54 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor Page 4  Hali kadhalika Mheshimiwa Spika, kwa wao kungoja barua kutoka kwa Auditor General  
wakati malalamishi yako kwa daftari walilopewa na wamewaan dikia baadhi ya wahusika waje 
wajitete na hawaja ja jitetea;  ilikua ni jukumu lao walete ripoti kama ilivyo kulingana na 
uchunguzi wao na sisi kama Bunge tuchukue hatua ya kulijadili na kutoa mapendekezo kwa 
sababu  Executive  walipewa muda wa kujitetea na ha wakulitekeleza hilo kwa uzembe wao, kwa 
makusudi wakijua hawana majibu mahusisi.  
 Na Mheshimwa Spika wasi wasi wangu mimi ni muundo msingi kabisa uliop o katika 
Kamati hii ya PAC, kwa sababu wengi wa wanachama katika Kamati hii ya PAC  ni wana chama 
wa Kamat i ya F edha… 
(Applause)  
 Ambao wao wanahusika moja kwa moja katika mas uala mengi ya utekelezaji ama 
utumizi wa fedha katika hizi Idara husika. Kwa hivyo wao pia hawapo tayari kwa hawa 
Executive  kuitwa na kujibu.  
 Kwa hivyo ni suala la ndani kwa ndani la k utufanya sisi hapa kupoteza muda wa Bunge 
lako tukufu kwa mambo ambayo hawawezi kuyatekeleza Mheshimiwa. Naomba utuelekeze 
Mheshimiwa Spika lakini tukitegemea Kamati husika tutamaliza miaka mitano pasi kupata ripoti 
hata moja kutoka kwa Kamati husika. Ahsa nte Mheshimiwa Spika.  
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you Hon. Mwamwiri.  Hon. Fadhili Makarani please 
can you respond?  
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu ): Thank you Mr. Speaker for giving me one more 
chance to respond on what the Hon. Members have raised . Mr. Speaker this is a House of law 
and p rocedures ; one Hon. Member has raised a query that we have not sat or we have not e ven 
written to the Departments, w e have proof  and if given time by next week Tuesday or five 
minutes from now we can go and peruse our files and bring to this Honourable House the letters 
that we have sen t to the Auditor General and the letter s that we have sent  to the Departments 
concerned.  
 Mr. Speaker the Committee works hand i n hand with the Auditor General, we  cannot and 
I am rep eating we cannot proceed to our sittings without the presence of th e Office of the 
Auditor General and t hat is why I said before we have to get a status report from the Auditor 
General for us to proceed with any issues raised in those reports. So Mr. Speak er it is the Office 
of the Auditor General that has failed us and an Hon. Member quoted Chapter 229 from the 
Constitution of Kenya. Mr. Speaker the Office of the Auditor General has also failed because 
these reports that we are talking about do not come at the right time  even though we receive 
them. Mr.  Speaker we have proof of the days that we receive the reports are not as specified in 
the Constitution ; we have requested to be  given two weeks and we  will bring to this Honourable 
House all what is required  and all the steps that we have taken as a Committee  and it will be 
clear in this Ho nourable House  who is failing who ...! 
 Mr. Speaker an Hon. Member said that the membership  of the Committee, M embers in 
that Committee are sa me Members in Finance Committee .  Mr. Speaker I con cur with that but it 
is this Honourable House that approved the Public Accounts Committtee and the Public 
Accounts Committee . As per our Standing Orders  it has got three financial y ears and if the Hon. 
Members are not satisfied with the  Committee then I will  have  no say Mr. Speaker other than to 
follow the procedure and follow the waves of the Assembly.

DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor Page 5  But Mr. Speaker we are working and I want to assure this Hon ourable House that we are 
together to ensure our County prospers  in develo pment … 
(Interruption)  
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Hon. Charles  Kitula, you are standing on a point of 
order?  
 The Chief Whip  (Hon. Kitula) : Yes, under Standing Order 229 of the Constitution, 
No.7. Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti nimemsikiza Mwenyekiti wa Kamati ya PAC na ningependa 
kumsomea ya kwamba,  audit r eports shall be submitted to Parliament or  the relevant County 
Assembly , na ni kweli tuliweza kupatiwa hizo  Audit Report  ya financial s tatement ya 2017 /2018 . 
Ilikua  tabled hapa, halafu  No.8 kama nilivyoweza k usom wa, within three months after receiving 
an Audit Report, Parliament or the County Assembly shall debate and consider the report and 
take appropriate action . 
 Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti imepita miezi sita hivi sasa tangu ripoti ilipoweza kuwa tabled , 
nashang aa barua yake ameandika ni barua ya nini kutoka kwa Auditor General?  Barua gani 
anataka yeye kama Mwenyekiti ili aweze kupata kama Kamati? Sasa nashangaa akisema 
kwamba ameandika barua kwa Auditor General , suali langu ni barua gani ambayo ameandika 
kwa Auditor General  wakati ripoti tayari tushapat iwa kutoka kwa Auditor General ? Ahsante.  
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Hon. Fadhili?  
 The Deputy Speaker  (Hon. Mwalimu ): Thank you Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker when 
report s are being tabled in this Honourable House i t becomes part and parcel of  that Committee 
and after rece iving the reports Public Accounts Committee , it is a C ommittee that has to work 
with the office of the Auditor General. Mr. Speaker you can not proceed without the input of the 
office of the Auditor  General ; it was clear when I said that we have to receive a status report 
from the office of the Auditor General.  
 Mr. Speaker when departments are being told to bring their responses that  is when the 
office of the Auditor Genera l prepares a status repor t; without  a status report we can n ot proceed 
to any step further. So Mr. Speaker we wrote  to the office of the Auditor General to get a statu s 
report and to confirm if the D epartments have sent their responses to the office of the Auditor 
General . Also  not only to send to the office of the Auditor G eneral  but also to bring to our 
Committee and I  have said it clear Mr. Speaker when I ros e to start speaking  there are 
Department s that have not sent thei r responses to the C ommittee and to the off ice of the Aud itor 
General and t hat is what is hindering the Committee to bring back a report that might be 
discussed in this Hon. House, thank you Mr. Speaker.  
 
 The Speaker (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you Hon. Fadhili. Y es Hon.  Raphael Bwire.  
 Hon. Bwire:  Thank you Mr. Speak er. Mr. Speaker of c ourse  we are not despising what 
the Chairperson of PAC is talking about but we are clearly following the rules and the l aws that 
governs this Nation  and it states clearly that after the submission of the report by th e office of the 
Audi tor General  within three months or after three months the report has to be tabled here;  
whether the C ommittee has written to the Auditor General to seek the status of the 
recommendation that were  submitted by the office or not.   
July 4 , 2019                               COUNTY ASSEMBLY DEBATES                                           54 
DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor Page 6  So we were to begin in tha t report as the Assembly after three months  whether the office 
of the Chairman on P AC has written a letter to the D epartment or to the Auditor General . We do 
not want to know what has happened there; al l we are askin g is that kindly stick to the l aw, y ou 
were to  report here after three months . You see we are discussing a report that we have not seen 
but we know that the Auditor Gene ral report is with your office so Mr. Speaker  I am here to 
request that through your guidance let us  be supplied by those lette rs within five m inutes if you 
can allow it, let u s see those letters that were written to the Auditor General and tha t one which 
was written to the D epartment concerned so that we can a bit build our trust to the PAC . 
Otherwise Mr. Speaker as the compositi on of that C ommittee as stated by Hon. Mwamwiri is full 
of the Members of Finance and less Members from other Committee, s o we doubt the 
composition of the Committee itself  and that is why we do  not want to go further and doubt it. 
We just need those two l etters that were written to the office of the Auditor General and the 
Department, thank you Mr. Speaker.  
 
 The Speaker (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you  very much Hon. Bwire . Hon. Fadhili Makarani I 
think you have heard from the Members concerning the issue, may be  you are overwhelmed by 
the work becaus e at the same time you are the D eputy Sp eaker, you are the Chairman of L iaison, 
so maybe you  can just admit to this House if you are overwhelmed by work and may be you can 
assign that work to someone else you know, ye s Hon. Junior.  
 Hon. Wambua:  Bwana Spika  Mheshimiwa Fadhili amesema anaweza kutoa kwa dakika 
tano, kwa hivyo ni muhimu sana atupatie kwa wakati huo. .. 
(Applause)  
 The Speaker (Hon. Khatri) : So Hon. Fadhili m oving forward, we understand may be you 
are overw helmed, you can just tell the House or may be write to my office and we can see we 
can consider that ; maybe we give that opportunity to someone else who can deliver.   
 So we are giving you two weeks and please if you can give the Hon. Members the copies 
of the letters which you have said you have written to the Auditor General so that they can have 
the copies and may be th ey can have confidence with you  and you can share that copy of the 
letter to  my office as well  and after two weeks we need to know where the House  stand s with 
this issue.  Thank  you very much Hon. Members. Y es Clerk next order.

Mheshimiwa Spika mambo ya  Elimu ni mambo ambayo t unatakiwa tuyapatie kipao mbele ; suala 
hili limekuja kwa Bunge letu mara kadha wa kadha, nimetumia hata kupatia nauli Kamati hii 
kuenda kutembelea shule hii ili iweze  kuleta taarifa  katika Bunge letu hili lakini nashan gaa 
mmoja katika Wanakamati wa K amati hii akisema kuwa bado wanaomba wiki  moja na 
twakumbuka wakati tukitafuta ama tukiitisha basari ilikuwa tukiambiwa hivyo hivyo wiki moja , 
wiki mbili na ilichukua karibu miezi sita ndi o tuw eze kupata majibu haya.

hata Jumanne waweze kutuletea tuju e hali ya shule hii ni v ipi, ahsante.  
 
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you Hon. Fadhili. Hon. Fadhili I think you just stated 
that you have already gone  to Kwa -Hola ECD, you went there to see the status?  
 Hon. Athman Mwamwiri:  Yes. 
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : So am sure you hav e the knowledge to tell us here briefly, 
you do  not need the report.  
 Hon. Athmani Mwamwiri:  Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika.  Mheshimiwa Spika baada ya 
msafara wetu Kwa H ola na shule nyengine tuliita  Idara  ya Elimu ama wahu sika wa idara hiyo na

kwamba wakipata quarter ya mwisho y a mgao wa  kifedha watakamilisha majengo yale ambayo

DISCLAIMER: The electronic version of the Official Hansard Report is for information 
purposes only. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor Page 8  Hii ni k wa s ababu mara si  moja al ioleta haba ri hizi Mhes himiwa Faith Boniface  
amezungumza kinaga ubaga akasema kwamba wale wanafunzi wanasoma chini ya nyumba 
iliojengw a na mabamba na kwamba hamna dalili yoyote  hata msingi haujawahi  kuchimbwa. Leo 
hii Mheshimiwa M bunge ambaye  ni mmoja wa W anakamati hiyo anazungu mza kwam ba 
imejengwa asilimia 75, Mheshimiwa tujifunze wa kati mwengine kuzungumza ukweli. Ha lafu 
utoe msamaha kwa wananchi wa Mombasa na Bunge hili ili  tuweze kuwapatia nyinyi na idara 
yenu wakati wa  kuwajengea wananchi wetu madarasa mazuri ya  kusomea.  
 Mheshimiwa Spik a ninavyo fahamu mimi na  hii Taarifa  ilivyokuja hamna hata msin gi 
ambao umejengwa kwa ajili ya  hii shule , hili ni darasa ambalo wanafunzi wanasomea chini ya 
mti na wengine wanasomea chini ya nyumba iliyojengw a na mabamba na inavuja . Sasa hiyo 
ndiyo status tunataka kujua kwamba kama Idara  yao wanataka kuchukua hatua gani, s io kuja 
kutuambia kwamba wamejenga asilimia 75, shukran.  
 
 The Speaker (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you. Y es Hon Hamida ? 
 Hon. Noor : Thank you Mr. Spea ker S ir for giving me this oppor tunity. T his thing has 
been co ming to this House for too long  and my fellow Member Faith Mwende has been asking 
about it and she says the children have  been learning under a tree and here we are being told 
there is 70  per cent o r 80 per cent  completion. I think this statement is a very p ressing one for 
those students with the sun of Mombasa to sit under the make shift and learn. I think we are not 
being fa ir to the children of Kwa Hola  and I think as a whole House we should go there and have 
a look at it.  
 The Speaker (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Hon. Samba ? 
 Hon. Samba:  Yes Hon. Speaker thank you for at least giving me this oppo rtunity, l et me 
also contribute. I have some few observations; first this is the C ommittee that has been delaying  
work of the House Hon. Spea ker. I can al so quote my colleague when it co mes to the issue of 
bursary and in fact we had to champion for the hum an rights to come and intervene  for the 
bursary issues to be sor ted out . Now I do not know whether also that is where we are heading to! 
Hon.  Speaker it is quite sad where  a Committee we do  not have a Chairperson or the Vice Chair 
and the M ember who is responding is not even accurate, h e is misleadi ng the House. This is 
because number one;  I fail to understand whether this C ommittee when they d id a site visit  did 
they actually have a Clerk? B ecause in case suppose there was in such scenario or situation 
where we do not have Chair or Vic e Chair we may have a Member who will read the report t hat 
has been written by a Clerk  but here comes a Member he just st ood up and  is misleading us , 75 
per cent  work done or 65  per cent  work done.  
 Hon. Speaker this  should go well in this House that in case you do  not have any written 
report, you do  not  stand for someth ing that you can not respond to it. B ecause  this is a House of 
rules and procedure s and everything that we contribute is capt ured in Hansard , now if we can tell 
him to substantiate between the work done and wh at is left he can not do that  and I do  not know 
why when i t comes to issues of Education D epartment we have issues . Let us take charge this 
time round so that at least the information that you are given is very accurate, thank you Hon. 
Speaker.  
 
 The Speaker (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you Hon. Samba.

12             Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti  kwanza ukiritimba, pili ut epetevu na tatu hujuma ; nafikiri 
Mheshimiwa mwenza wa sarafu na fedha anaye ibua swala nyeti sana ili watu wajue , wakaazi wa 
Mombasa wajue  kuwa ni hoja ngapi zililetwa katika Bung e hili . Wamefikiriwa haki yao 
imezungumz wa namna gani katika Bunge hili.  Zile tarifa zote  zilizokusanywa katika Bunge hili 
je Serikali ambayo ni Executiv e imetekeleza mangapi? Maana sasa imekuwa ni mithili y a 
changanya maharagwe na mahindi.  
            Kwa hivyo kil a mtu hapa aweze kuwajibika na kubeba mzigo wake  kwa hivyo mimi 
napenda sana maswala haya ya kuse ma kuwa hizi ripoti  ziletwe  twataka kujua Wodi  kwa Wosi  
kulifanywa nini? Zile hoja tumeleta hapa B ungeni zimesaidia vipi wakaazi wa Mombasa 
kuboresha mazingira  na hali ya maisha yao Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti . Kwa hivyo haya ni 
maswala matatu ni lazima tuyaangalie ikiwa ni ukir itimba, utepetevu na hujuma zijulikane wapi 
hawajukumiki, wapi wanazembea?...   
(Applause)  
 Sisi kama W abunge wa K aunti hii tumezoa kubeba misa laba ya watu Mheshimiwa 
Mwenyekiti; w engine  hali ya jamvi ndio kama hizi nguvu ya kubeba misalaba ya watu hatuna, 
kila mtu aweze kubeba msalaba wake Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti . Kwa hivyo hi yo taarifa iweze 
kuletwa hapa haraka iwezekanavyo na usha hidi k amili na kila Mbunge hapa ajue W odi yake 
katika hoja zilizoletwa hapa kumefanywa nini? Zimetekelezwa  vipi? K ila mtu awajibike kuna 
njia Mheshimiwa wa s heria, hili ni B unge la she ria Mheshimiwa Spika ahsante.  
(Applause)  
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you Hon. She be. Yes Hon Bwire you wanted to say 
something?  
 Hon. Bwire:  Thank you Mr. Speaker . I just wanted to remind you that this is the second 
time that Hon. Mwam wiri has been misleading this House  according to me . Yes the co ncern was 
raised sometimes back  but no response  was brought back to this House.  So for him telling us that 
the concern was raised back sometimes back and they have never responded to this concern and 
that is why Hon. Hatimy has come up again with the same issue ! Mr Speaker as stated by Hon. 
Shebe Athman, actually we are almost blamed for having done nothi ng yet we do pass m Motions 
here; t hat touch  on the lives of the people we represent in this County.  
 So we will be so glad to be t old that this is the number of Motion s that we have  passed 
and t his is how we  have  implemente d those M otions you have passed.  Otherwise  Mr. Speaker 
we will be bringing the M otions and we have realised of late it has demoralised M embers 
because we bring M otion s we discuss we pass it but no i mplementation that takes plac e. So we 
need to exercise our mandate as the County Assembly . We need to stamp our authority so that 
whoever is sleeping on job goes back home  if he is not going to deliver. Th ank you Mr. Speaker.  
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you Hon. Bwire. Y es Hon.  Bernard Ogutu?

13  Manake kuna M iswada  ambazo haziendi na miradi na wengine wanasema kwamba ni 
miradi mingapi imefanyika katika kila Wodi.  Ningeomba Naibu Mwenyekiti  pia aweze kuomba 
muda... 
(Consultations)  
 Nafikiri wiki moja haitoshi  hiyo kazi ni kubwa ni lazima tuf uatilizie kila kitu na t ulete 
ripoti ambayo imekamilika.  Kwa hivyo kwangu ningeomba tupewe kama miezi mitatu ili tuweze 
kufanya h iyo kazi ili iwe rahisi  kwetu.  
 The Speaker  (Hon.  Khatri) : Hon. Bernard Ogutu , are you part of that C ommittee?   
 Hon. Ogutu : Yes. 
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Okay, yes Hon. Samba?  
 Hon. Samba:  Hon. Speaker I am a Member of the said C ommittee and as the M embers 
have said initially w hat Hon. Members requested was the M otion tracker and then Chairman 
respond ed if my memory serves me well. N ow it is the M otion s that have  been implemented ; I 
think we started that journey but whoever was in charge we invited the County S ecretary and in 
the process I think you know w hat be fell the County Secretary.  Currently  we do  not have County 
Secretary since it has also come u p we are going as Department per D epartment however what 
my colleague has said that one week is not eno ugh, if we can be given two to three weeks at least 
we want to bring tangible convincing and conclusive report to this Hon ourable  House, thank you 
Hon. Speaker.  
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you Hon. Samba. Y es Hon. Milka Moraa?  
 Hon. Moraa:  Thank you Mr. Speaker for allowing me this time to also give my 
scentiment s on the same.  I think I want to congratulate the Hon. Member for this importan t 
Statement  because our co re business  here is to legislate and bringing Motion s is part of that and 
when a M ember  of Implementation C ommittee talks about three months, it i s quite sad because 
we have been here for almost two years and somebody is talking about being given three months 
to go and find out and bring other s report on how the Motions have been implemented,  to repeat 
again I find that its very up sad.  The colleagues that have  talked about three weeks that is a bit 
reasonable ; If we pass a Motion here and it  is not implemented month in month out the Members 
of the House get demoralised and probably that  is why  there is no business coming in  these days 
and I remember all M otions passed in this House are very impor tant to the citizens of Mombasa.   
 I remember we passed a Motion on installation of litter  bins to keep our County very 
clean and look very impressive even to our tourists who are coming here and also  to the citizens 
of this County.  It has not be en done two years down the line ; are we serious implem entation 
Committee? Do not come here telling us about three months, two weeks, four weeks , no! We 
refuse to buy  such kind of things . Thank you Mr. Speaker.

16  Hili ni Bunge la sheria na kutekeleza na kufuatilia na kuhakikisha kuwa yale yote 
ambayo mwananchi wa Mombasa anataka yafanyiwe ama yatekelezwe basi ni wajibu wetu sisi 
kutekeleza. Nafikiri Mhe shimiwa Mwenyekiti ni muda muafaka umefika kuweza kuangalia 
Kamati nyingi za Bunge hili letu la Mombasa vinara wao na mseto wa ile Kamati, nafikiri ni 
wakati muafaka umefika kuweza kupigwa msasa vizuri. Kwa sababu ukiangalia majukumu 
makubwa ya Bunge hili ni kuweza kuhakikisha tunabuni sheria ambazo zinasaidia mwananchi 
wetu kule mashinani na ikiwa wewe umepatiwa cheo kama Mwe nyekiti ama Naibu wake na 
wale Wanakamati wote ambao wako pale Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti basi ni  kuhakikisha kuwa 
nyinyi mnawajibikia, kam a ile Kamati kuhakikisha k uwa ile hoja ilioletwa pale na Wabunge 
wenzako basi unaif uatilia.  
 Leo nikinaya ukian galia kama Kamati ambayo ina  umuhimu mkubwa sana ya Elimu, 
Kamati kama ya Implementation , Kamati kama ya PAC  ukiangalia mseto wa wale wanachama 
na vinara, wallahi  ni masikitiko kwa sababu ikiwa mtu ataenuka aombe miezi mitatu kwa 
maswala kama haya ambayo yana umuhimu mkubwa Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti! Basi sijui sisi 
twafanyanya nini hapa? Aidha tuangalie ni muda muafaka umefika wa  kupiga hizi Kamati 
msasa , tuangalie vipi tutaweza kuzalisha hoja, vipi tutaweza  kuleta natija kwa watu wetu na  
zitategemea hizi Kamati Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti.  
 Kwa hivyo mimi hoja yan gu ya msingi ni kuangalia hizi Kamati ambazo zinaendesha 
Bunge hili katika maswala mazima ya kutetea haki ya mwanachi kule mashinani basi ziweze 
kuwajibika Mheshimiwa Mwenyekiti.

Mwam wiri?  
 Hon. Ath man Mwamwiri:  Ahsante Mheshimiwa Spika. Mheshimiwa Spika kwanza 
nikiwa na akili zangu razini ningemtaka Mheshimiwa wa Junda anitake radhi kwa heshima na 
taadhim a kwa kunieekelea kauli ya kwam ba napotosha Bunge hili. Mheshimiwa Spika 
kumbuku mbu zangu ziko sahihi  ya kwamba kauli hii ililetwa  tarehe 29 mwezi wa tisa, tarehe 29 
mwezi wa kumi na moja mwaka e lfu mbili na kumi na nane (29/11/2018) . Tulileta jawabu katika 
Jumba hili na nina hiyari na ruhusa ae nde kwa kumbukumbu za Bunge hili na kama  atakosa hilo 
ninalolisema mimi nitamtaka radhi. Lakini kunihukumu na kunihujumu ya kwamba napotosha 
Bunge wakati kumbukumbu zangu ziko sahihi Mheshimiwa hiyo si kauli njema sijaipokea vizuri 
na namtaka Mheshimiwa wa Junda kwa heshima na taadhima anitake r adhi.  
 Mheshimiwa Spika kuhusu wiki moja kujibu haya ni swala ambalo siswala geni na 
tulifanya vikao vya kutosha na tunajua ya kwamba asilimia kubwa ya hoja hizi hazijatekelezwa 
kwa sababu ya msukumo mahali mahsusi .  
 Mheshimiwa Spika ni juzi  tu kumekuwa na kauli hapa ya kutaka kujua baadhi ya 
utekelezaji wa mipango na miradi katika bajeti iliokamilika tarehe 30 ya mwezi wa sita na hapa 
kulitembea simu kutoka upande wa  pili ya baadhi ya Waheshimiwa wakiambiwa hoja hiyo 
isitekelezeke na juku mu hili lilikuwa kwa Kamati ya Utekelezaji na Mwenyekiti wangu 
akaingizwa uoga kwa muda simuoni kwa sababu ya kutaka kutekeleza hoja ama kauli iliyokuwa 
inataka kujulia miradi na mgao wa kifedha kila idara iliyoganyiwa.

17  Kwa hivyo Mhes himiwa Spika hoja hizi ziko mubashara ya kwamba hazijatekelezwa 
asilimia kubwa na  kikezo tunakijua kiko wapi , kwa hivyo hata tukisema mwezi ni  kupoteza 
muda lakini wiki moja inatosha kukamilisha hili. Hii ni kwa  sababu Mheshimiwa hakuna 
kilichotekelezeka Mheshimiw a Spika , lakini halahala Mheshimiwa wa Junda anitake radhi kwa 
sababu kauli hiyo imeingia kwa kumbukumbu za Bunge hili ya kwamba mimi mwanafalsafa 
Mkereketwa Mheshimiwa wa Wodi ya Likoni  ninapotosha Jumba hili wakati Mheshimiwa Spika 
kwa hes hima Bunge hil i litabakia kunikumbuka kwa mch ango wangu katika Bunge hili. Kwa 
hivyo sio sahihi kauli hiyo kubakia katika kumbukumbu za Bunge hili Mheshimiwa Spika. 
Ahsante.
