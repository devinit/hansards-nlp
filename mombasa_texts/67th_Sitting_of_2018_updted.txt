Page 2 THAT AWARE THAT high mast lighting is the most effective and convenient  way 
of illuminating large outdoor areas for instance in densely populated areas.  
 
FURTHER AWARE that hi gh mast lighting does provide a conduc ive environment 
for productive economic activities  as well as enhancing  security surveillance  in 
densely populated areas.  
 
NOTING  THAT some of the areas in Mombasa County which are densely populated 
are yet to be instal led with high mast lighting.  
 
CONCERNED THAT the lack of high mast lighting may lead to high levels of 
insecurity while also negatively imp acting the  enabling environment necessary for 
productive economic activities.  
 
I therefore urge this Assembly to resol ve that;  
 
The County government to install high mast lighting in densely populated areas in 
order to provide security and surveillances while also creating a conduc ive 
environment  for productive  economic activities . 
 
 Thank you Mr. Speaker.  
 
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Than k you Hon Kitula . Yes Clerk. 
 
STATEMENTS  
STATUS OF MOMBASA YOUTH FISH PR OJECT  
 
 Yes Hon . Wambua, Chairperson Committee on Agriculture , Fisheries and Livestock 
Cooperation , is the response ready?  
  
 Hon. Wambua:  Yes it  is ready . 
 
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : You may continue . 
 
 Hon. Wambua: The County government of Mombasa initiated and funded a fish 
farming project called Momba sa youth fish farming project.  The idea  was generated from the 
fish farming experience under the Economic Stimulus Program ESP of n ational  government 
which had shown that in addition to capture fishe ries, fish farming can be an alternative 
source of fish production and can create sustainabl e employment for youths in the County.  It 
was expected that the establishment of the fish project wi ll contribute to the following  very 
critical  strategic  themes of the department : 
  
a. Increase fish production in the County by supplementing what is harvested from the 
capture of fisheries ; 
 
b. Create employment oppor tunities for both men and women ; 
 
c. Contr ibute towards food  security and poverty reduction ;

Page 3 d. Diversification  of income source s to both the youth and Women ; 
 
e. Raise revenue for the County from trading in fish and fishing products.  
 
 The government of Mombasa County  developed this creative idea ( Wanting to 
develop aquaculture in the County) after finding out that there were not enough suitable sites 
for earthen ponds in the County.  The production system is semi -intensive us ing a stock 500 
catfish in 39 m etres squar es fish tanks (38 catfish per m etre square intensive feeding with 
floating pellets). Integrated fish farming and agriculture/gardeni ng where possible small stock 
(Goats) husbandry to be practiced by women .  
 Attached here below is summ ary on the status of the project/tanks.  
 
1. Show ground, Nyali , one tank. The tank has few catfish and ready for harvesting. This is 
a tank that is used by a demonstrationâ€¦  
 
(Interruption ) 
 
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Yes Hon. Samba?  
 
 Hon. Samba:  Thank you Mr. Speaker . I think may be just to remind the Hon. 
Member that since we have the copies and I find it unnecessary for him to go through while 
each and every Member has its own copy. So maybe he has done his part we are also going 
through our copies to save time. Thank you Mr. Speaker . 
 
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : So you are satisfied Member 's with the copy?  
  
(Silence ) 
 
 Thank you Hon. Wambua, so you can just wi nd up. 
 
 Hon. Wambua:  Thank you, maybe way forwa rd. The Department is planning to  
procure liners, fingerlings and fish feed to operationalize the dormant fish tasks.  The 
Department also had engaged an expert to review the operations and management of the 
tanks and came up with recommendations to improve performance of the tanks. Among the 
recommendations included installation of solar pumps to pump water circulation, bio filt er to 
clean the water for re -use and intensification of fish farming. He also recommended that this 
will be piloted first before being rolled over to the other tanks.  
 The Department is also planning to hand over the management of aquaculture tanks 
and mari culture to identified active women groups. The youth will be capacity built to 
venture into capture fisheries in the deep sea. This will be done through the procurement of 
deep sea fishing vessels that is on -going.  
 
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) :Thank you Hon. Wambua. Yes Clerk?
