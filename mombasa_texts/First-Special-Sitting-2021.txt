COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR  
 
 Thank you . Good morning , once again Hon. Members.  Honourable Members, I take this 
opportunity to welcome you to this Special Sitting of the County Assembly. I hope you all had 
happy holidays. I hope that it is  not too late for me to wish you all a Happy New Year.  As you 
are all aware, this House commenced the long recess on Thursday, 3rd December , 2020. The 
recess will end on Monday 8th February , 2021 . 
 The Corona pandemic which occ urred in 2020 adversely affec ted normal operations of 
almost all institutuions , including the County Assembly. We th us did not conduct our regular 
sittings as per the appr oved calenda r for the year , 2020. This year has started on a positive note 
as children have gone back to school an d businesses which had closed are now reopening. We 
thank the Almighty God for enabling us to see this New Year and my prayer is that it will be a 
better year than 2020 and that COVID -19 will either be totally eradicated or a way shall be found 
to contain it so that normalcy resumes.  
Before we proceed ed for the long recess, The Mombasa County Finance Bill, 2020 had 
undergone First reading on the 1st December , 2020 . Pursuant to Standing Order 121, it stood 
committed to the Committee on Finance, Budget and Ap propriations. The Committee was to 
conduct public participation as required by law and on the 8th January , 2021 an advertisement 
was made in the local dailies and other media platforms. I believe the r eport from the publi c 
participation is ready and hen ce this Special Sitting has been called to finalise the remaining 
processes of the Bill.  
Honourable Members , in accordance with Standing Order 26 of the Mombasa County 
Standing Orders, todayâ€™s Special Sitting is duly convened as it was published in the Kenya
