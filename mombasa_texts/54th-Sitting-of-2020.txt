ulivyoangazia katika mjadala uliopita ni kwamba ni wa muhimu  ila tu niko na wazo ikiwa 
utaniruhusu n a ipendeze Bunge hili ya kwamba katika K amati hii dukuduku langu ni kwamba 
Membership ya Kamati hii haijazingatia uwakilishi wa eneo kubwa zaidi katika nda ni ya 
Mombasa Kaunti ya Kisauni  ambapo sisi wajumbe wa Kisauni wajumbe saba tunawakilisha 
watu zaidi ya laki tatu na katika K amati hii ni masikitiko kwamba hakuna mwakilishi hata 
mmoja ambayo anatoka eneo la Kisa uni, angalau tuweze kuzungum za mambo ya wale watu laki 
tatu wa eneo la Kisauni .  
Mhe. Spika hilo ndilo dukuduku langu ya kwamba  ingekua bora kama K amati hii 
ingekuwa na wakilishi kutoka kila Sub-County , ili mambo ya Sub-County  yaweze kuzungumzwa 
na Waheshimiwa ambao wanatoka katika m aeneo yale. Kwa hivyo Mhe. Spika dukuduku langu 
ni kwamba tu s isi kama Waw akilishi wa Kisauni, ambao tunawakilisha watu laki tatu katika 
Bunge hili la Mombasa Kaunti, ni kwamba hatujapewa nafasi hata moja kana kw amba mmoja 
wetu angalau anakaa K amati hii, n i kwamba mamb o ya Kisauni mtu aweze kuzungumza.

Momb asa Kaunti, jinsi ambavyo kwamba twa weza tukapata zile huduma za C OVID -19 ama vile

Sub-County  kama ni ny ingine wameingia kama ni wawili  lakini Kisauni hai jawakilishwa na hio 
Corrona iko ni janga la ulimwengu mzima. Kwa hivyo maombi  yangu ni kwamba watu wa 
Kisauni pia ni watu wa Mombasa waangaliwe na kuna Waheshimiwa hapa katika Bunge 
wanaw awakilisha. Kwa hivyo ninaomba kufanyiwe marekebisho  ya kwamba Kisaun i itambulike

kwenye watu 21, watu 19 wamepatikana na Corona. Kuna na nyumba ya pili Mhe. Spika nayo 
wamekwenda kufa nya kwenye watu kumi, watu wanane wamepata ugonjwa wa Corona.  
 Mhe. Spika kubadilisha K amati kuna mpangilio , huwa kusema kuwa ni lazima mtu aje na 
marekebisho  ya kusema kuwa mimi nataka ku rekebisha  hii badili  ya jina hili liingie jina hili  
lakini kuna umu himu  kwa haraka vile inavyowezekana hii K amati i ingie i anze kufanya . Kwa

particular Motion, but again I was happy and  pleased when the mover of the Motion tried to clear  
my doubts  when he said that this ma tter was actually subjected to public participation .
