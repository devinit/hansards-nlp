STATEMENTS  
STALLING OF MWACHE DAM PROJECT  
 
 Yes Hon.  Renson Thoya?  
 
 Hon.  Thoya : Mr. Speaker Sir I want to seek a statement, stalling  of Mwache dam project 
from  the Chairperson Committee on Water, Sanitation and Natural Resources : 
 
 1. Whether  he is aware that the County Assembly o f Kwale has passed a resolution 
distancing itself from the planning/rolling out of the Mwache dam project that was b eing 
financed by the World Bank;  
 
 2. Whether  he is aware that the County Assembly of Kwale subsequent ly put a public 
notice in the N ation newspaper on 20th November , 2018 notifying the public that it will not 
participate in any plans /project relating to Mwache dam;  
 
 3. Whether  he is aware that this resolution has negative impact on the residents of 
Mombasa, considering  that the dam wa s meant to curb water shortages; and,   
 
 4. Whether  the County g overnment of Mombasa have any plans or measures to ensure 
the project kicks off.  Thank you.  
 
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you Hon.  Renson Thoya, can you please explain to 
us how  is this statement going to help the County of Mombasa , the one that you are asking?  
 
 Hon. Thoya:  Mr. Speaker you are aware that ther e is water shortage in  Mombasa C ounty 
and it was the view of the national g overnment that the County A ssembly of Mombasa to do a 
project at Mwache dam so that we can help the residents of Mombasa at large . It was all rosy 
until we learned from the lo cal dailies yesterday that the C ounty Assembly of Kwale has 
resolved to distance itself from the project and as you are aware Mwache dam is in Kwale and if 
at all they are not going to participate that mean s the project will not take off , so Mwache Dam 
projec t is of great necessity to the C ounty government of Mombasa and i. ..that this was a 
resolution of the Kwale  County Assembly . We need also to come up with a resolutio n that will 
bring on board the County A ssembly of Kwale to see that the project does not stop . Thank you.  
 
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Thank you Hon. Thoya, I can see there is a new Member  in 
the House, yes  Hon.  Mwamwiri ? 
 
 Hon. Athman Mwamwiri : Thank y ou Mr. Speaker. I think  the issue does not concern us 
because we passed a resolution asking our C ounty government to invest in water desalination 
and the issue was passed here and the tendering process has already started so in the near  future  
we shall be depending on water from our C ounty and not Kwale C ounty , it will be an issue to 
Kwal e County but not us Mr. Speake r. Thank you.

 Hon.  Mohamed Hatimy:  Ahsante Mheshimiwa S pika,  acha nimpongeze aliyeleta hii 
taarifa , ni ya muhim u kwa Mombasa na ni lazima liti liwe mkazo sana kwa sababu sisi 
tunavyojua Gavana  wetu alitia sahihi na shirika la World B ank kufanya jambo hili lakini sasa 
tunaona K aunti ya Kwale inaleta siasa ambazo sidhani zitasaidia jambo lolote ... 
 
(Interruption ) 
 
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Hon. Hatimy please tell us in details so that we can know 
because the G overnor has signed documents regarding Mwache dam or it is regarding the 
desalination plant ? Those are two different  things.  
 
 Hon.  Mohamed Hatimy:  About  one year back in France  the Go vernor  signed an  
agreement na World Ba nk and he was accompanied by the CEC Water...  
 
 The Speaker  (Hon. Khatri) : Regarding the Mwache Dam?  
 
 Hon.  Mohamed Hatimy:  Mwache dam,  kuwa wataleta maji Mombasa kwa hivyo 
tunaona kumebadilika mambo kwa hivyo ni jambo ambalo lazima tuliti lie umuhimu wa kuweza 
kulijua ili tup ate kujua sisi watu wa Mombasa .

 Hon.  Bwire:  Thank you Mr. Chair.  Mr. Speaker as a represe ntative of Junda I am not 
aware and it has never co me to my attention whether the G overnor signed anything to do with 
the so called Mwache dam project and i find it irrelevant to discuss something that i have never 
heard  or  have never seen . As a representative of the people the Kwale County Assembly did 
what they did because it was within their manda te because how and whether the G overnor signed 
it so that we will be discussing something that we have information on.  Thank you Mr. Speaker.

Committee?

things that Hon.  Mwalimu you w ill come and tell us from your C ommittee.  Yes Hon.  Hatimy?
