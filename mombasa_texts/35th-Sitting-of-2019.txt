do not get, we pay for that unfavorabl e to us and it has been a routine each and every moment 
that when we go ... let me take for instance  National Hospital Insura nce Fund (NHIF)  deduction s 
and remittance s, deduction they do it in time but to remit they take time.  Now I have never 
gone to a hospital and use my card of NHIF  assisted me, so maybe if he can elaborate there but  
the statement is good and we appreciate he has done good effort, so maybe we can know the 
status of Ma rch and April being that we are towards the end of the month of April. Thank you.
