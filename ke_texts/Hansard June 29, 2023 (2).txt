 Madam Temporary Speaker , allow me to say that these  Facilities were constructed long ag o. They 
do not have Sanitary  Facilitie s, that is  the Washrooms  and we cannot operationali se a Facility 
without Washrooms. That defeats its purpose and that is why they are saying if the Hon orable  
Members from those areas together with the members of the co mmunity set aside money during 
the Public Participation to construct those Washroom s and also do renovations that are supposed 
to be done, then perhaps those F acilities can be operationali sed and the Executive is going to take 
the Medicine and Medical Officers to make sure that those Facilities are operationali sed.

Hon. Njuguna Mwaura : We also have others as outlined in the Report  Madam Temporary 
Speaker, and th ese Equipment  amounts to billions of shillings , only for that Facility.  
Therefore  Mr. Temporary Speaker , we are requesting the rest be included as outlined , and then we 
go to the  Laboratory , the Dental Unit; we go to specific  Clinics for specialis ation and so forth. We 
also have Administration  and Human Resources that are for Level Five. A ll these  Equipment , for 
PGH alone, require Kshs  5 billion so that we can operationali se that Facility , and that is why we 28 Oxygen Cylinder Small  10

want the Implementation Committee to capture these things so that in the next Budget, this 
Department must showcase that they have put aside funds for operationali sation of our Level  Five 
So that they can shift from the old dilapidated buildings that were used as a Military Camp or the  
Barracks for the Colonial Government , to the ODP that is newly constructed so that people of 
Nakuru can start…   
Hon. Ali Abdi : Point of Order  Madam Speaker . 
The Temporary Speaker  (Hon. Loise Kagecha): Yes Hon . Duale.  
QUORUM  
Hon. Ali Hassan:  [On a Point of Order] . Thank you  Madam Temporary Speaker , I am standing 
on Standing Order 37 , on the issue of quorum in the Assembly . As you can see, we have no quorum 
to proceed with the Business. So Madam Temporary Speaker , with your indulgence, we can ask 
Members  who are outside to come in so that we can have a good number that constitutes a quorum. 
Thank you Madam Temporary Speaker.  
The Temporary Speaker  (Hon. Loise Kagecha): S erjeant at Arms can you please confirm 
whether we have a quorum .  
(The Serjeant at Arms  counts the Members in the House and  confirms there is no quorum)  
 (The Bell was rang) 
Hon. John Maritim:  The bell has been r ang but we still do not have a quorum.  He is just making 
a lot of unnecessary air pollution.  I think the best thing is to let the Chairperson Committee on  
Health  Services to continue, we proceed from there.  
The Temporary Speaker  (Hon. Loise Kagecha): Hon. Maritim, are you referring to air pollution 
or noi se pollution ? Do we have any Whip around to confirm whether we have quorum? Hon orable  
Members, based on Standing Order 37, this House lacks quorum to continue with the Business of 
the Sitting.  
ADJOURNMENT  
Honourable Members, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 AM. 
The House rose at 4.05 PM
