All the Committees and Chairs that have been mentioned kindly note and ens ure that you fast rack 
and do the necessary  
I saw Chair Lands and  Housing. Do you have an update on how far the two Petitions  have gone?  
Hon. Peter Palangâ€™a : Mr. Temporary Speaker, the first Petition  on Torobeek Community for 
resettlement, w e even had a meeting last week with the Senate because apparently, the issues of 
resettlement and giving an alternative land would not  have not been handled  single handedly by 
the Assembly and since  the very community  had done the Petition to the Senate as  such. We had 
a meeting last week and the Members can  attest to that, thanks for those who attended.  
We had the famous  Okiya Omutata leading the team and Senator from Baringo. So we are in the 
process of coming up with a Report on the same. So, Mr. Tempor ary Speaker, as you reali se some 
of these issues cannot be handled overnight. But we are on it  and luckily, I want to announce and 
report here, that even the Senate itself is really keen on this. And we will the refore  combine and 
report this.  
On the other  issues of  Kiplemeiwo Report Mr. Temporary Speaker, we had a visit as well as a 
Committee. And there are a number of issues that are coming up on the same in terms of how the 
balloting was done . The issues that really came up after our visits, we have henc e invited these 
people ; the Sub-County Admin, the Ward-Admin, the Surveyors and the likes so that we f urnish  
ourselves with a well-informed  Report . They are  appearing before our Committee on Thursday, 
which is day after tomorrow  Mr. Temporary Speaker so that of  this then we will have an all-
inclusive  Report.  
So that is the far w e have gone, we are on this and we are keen, we will read we would not  like to 
give a shoddy job, Mr. Speaker on this. And again, Mr. Temporary Speaker, it  is important to note 
that at some point we are affected by the programs of this particular house. For example, when we 
have the whole house and other meetings at times they interfere, but we are keen on delivering the 
same quality job. Good job by the committee. Thank you, Mr. Temporary Speaker.  
The Temporary Speaker (Hon. Michael Gathanwa):  Thank you, Chair. Thank you for the update. 
And also for committing to do a very thorough job.  Is Hon. Rose the Chair Environment in or the 
Vice Chair?  
All right, so as I said earlier  all the Chairs kindly note all the pending businesses and work on 
them. Next Order !
