NOTICE(s) OF MOTION  
PURCHASE OF BOREHOLE DRILLING MACHINE  
The Temporary Speaker (Hon . Michael Gathanwa): We have a Notice of Motion from Hon. 
Francis Mungai, M CA Malewa West.  
Hon. Francis  Kuria : Thank you Mr. Temporary Speaker , I beg to give a Notice of the 
following Motion ; THAT,  Whereas the County Government appropriates funds for various 
projects each Financial Year including drilling of boreholes in various Wards; Recogni sing that  
Nakuru is a water scarce County thus requires deliberate interventions to cushion the residents 
from water shortages; Appreciating that the County Government in the past has made efforts 
to address water shortages through drilling of boreholes among other measures; Cogni sant that 
an analysis of the cost of drilling and casing of a single borehole throug h tendering process 
ranges between Kshs. 2.5 Million - Kshs.3.5 Million depending on the depth and the nature of 
the rock and soil formation; Noting that the County Government is capable of allocating 
financial resources to purchase borehole drilling equip ment at a relatively affordable price 
compared t o the amount appropriated each Financial Year for such projects;  
Now therefore , this House resolves that as a long -term strategy to reduce the cost, the County 
Government allocates resources to purchase Borehole drilling machine.  I beg to give a Notice 
of Motion  
The Temporary Speaker  (Hon. Michael Gathanwa): The notice is well given.
