The Temporary Speaker  (Hon.  Michael Gathanwa ): We have a Statement ; Pursuant to the 
provision of Standing Order 47 (2) ( c), the following request will be made . Honorable Robert Ruto 
to request for a Statement  from the Chairperson  of the Committe e on Energy, Environment, Water 
and Natural Resources concerning Water Piping Projects across Lalwe t and  Mogoon in Kapkures

Hon. Robert Ruto: Thank you Mr. Temporary Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order  47 (2) (c) , I 
rise to request for a Statement  from the Chairperson  of the Committee  on Energy, Environment , 
Water  and Natural Resources concerning Water Piping Projects across  Lalwet and Mogoon  in 
Kapkures  Ward.  
Mr. Temporary S peaker , Lalwe t and Mugoon Water Piping Project was awarded Kshs 1.5 Million 
in the Financial Year 2022/2023 Budget . The amount was to be used in piping  of the same but was 
changed to Supply  of Water Pipes to Ingobor Water Project .  
Mr. Temporary Speaker, i t is unfortunate to note that the Contracto r who was contracted to 
undertake the project changed the description of the project to supply thirty four  pipes and one, 10 
000 litres plastic tank to Ingobor Water Project  which had not been programed for the same. Upon 
inquiry 26 out of the 34 w ater pipes that were delivered for Ingobor Water Project  had already 
been used.  
The remaining eight  pipes and the one , 10,000 litres tank have been redirected to Lalwet a nd 
Mugon Project though the piping has not commenced since the pipes are not yet sufficient . Mr. 
Temporary Speaker, i n view of this , I request the Chairperson for the Committee of Energy, 
Environment, Water and Natural Resources to respond on the following.  
1. Whether the CECM is aware that the Lalw et/Mugo on Water Project was redirected to 
Ingobor Water Project . 
2. How the County  Government  will recover the mon ies spent on the  26 pipes that were 
supplied and used in Ingobor Project that was not budget ed for. 
3. The me asures that the Department  has put in place to curb such mix up in future , in terms 
of identification and implementation of project s in adherence to approved budget s. 
4. Why the project description was changed to supply instead of piping.  
5. Measures the Department  has put in place to ensure the project is completed within the 
minimum time possible.  
Thank you Mr.  Temporary  Speaker . 
The Temporary Speaker  (Hon. Michael Gathanwa):  Thank you I would wish to commit the 
request to the Chair Committe e of Energy, Environment, Water and Natural Resources. Kindly 
take up the matter and give a response in 14 days. We also have a response to a Statement.

The Temporary Speaker  (Hon. Michael Gathanwa): Thank you so much, I see Hon. Wanjohi is 
in the House and probably you can comment on whether that was what you were looking for.  
The Minority Leader  (Hon. Philip Wanjohi): Thank you Mr. Temporary Speaker , I wish to thank 
the Hon. Member for Turi and the Chair for Health Committee for the prompt res ponse they have 
made towards my Statement .  
However  Mr. Temporary Speaker , I am concerned after listening and of course reading because of 
cause they gave me the Statement ; my observation is that our Health Facilities  are under staffed 
and especially with Nurses and Health Worker s and some of our Health Facilities  in fact 60 percent 
of them across the County  are understaffed and in some of the Facilities, the Health Centres  have 
at least one Nurse which is very dangerou s; and therefore it means that when this Nurse or Health 
Worker  goes on leave or is sick or admitted, the Health Facility  has to be closed and you know 
Health Facility  is not a shop where you can leave someone to take care of it.  
Therefore, my recommendat ion to the Health Committee whose Members  are in this House that 
we have two staff in each of Health Facilities so that when one Health Worker  goes on leave or 
has to go for a meeting, that Health Facility  is not closed. Mr. Temporary Speaker  I am satisfied 
with the response of the Statement ; thank  you. 
The Temporary Speaker  (Hon. Michael Gathanwa): Thank you so much .
