Parkview sub location , Mwariki, Barut ward, bordering Lake Nakuru national park due to rising 
water levels caused by climate change stands committed to the Committee on Environment.  
Hon. Wilson Mwangi : Mr. Speaker,  I rise on the issue of the  Petitions that we have committed 
to different Committees. We have so many Petitions  pending. Can we have a timeline where 
those  Committees can be able to table their report s as soon as possible.  As I was entering the 
gate today, I met a group of demonstrators  and they handed over a P etition to this H ouse. There 
is need becau se as they gi ve or deliver the Petitions to us, they want that P etition to be fast 
tracked. We may be having P etitions from  the last Assembly which are pe nding. My prayer is 
that we as C ommitte es be given the a uthority to fast track all the P etition s and have a timelin e so 
that we can t able all those reports in this H ouse. Thank you.  
The Deputy Speaker (Hon.Joseph Ngware ): Thank you Honorable Member.  
Hon Anthony Kanyere : Mr. Speaker  sir, I rise on Standing O rder 205. You find that when these  
Petitions are committed to Committees, most of  these Committees are Sector al and they have a 
lot in their interest. I am standing on that Standing Order, as the chair Legal and Justice 
Committeeâ€¦

conjoined in such Petitions because most of our mandates lies on human rights and justice, so 
that we can expedite the exercise since most  of the  Committees have a lot in their dockets , in that 
they oversight the Executive. I am just asking if we can be enjoined  in such P etitions as a
