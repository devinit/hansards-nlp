WARD PROJECT SAVINGS  
The Temporary Speaker  (Hon. Loise Kagecha ): The next Notice of Motion is to be  given by the 
Hon. John Mwangi, MCA Turi Ward. 
Hon. John Mwangi : Thank you Madam Temporary S peaker. I rise to give a  Notice of Motion in 
respect to Ward Proj ect Savings .  
THAT Aware that the County Government appropriates  funds for various projects in each 
Financial Year in all the 55 Wards ; Recogni sing that amount for each project as approved in the  
Budget does not translate to the actual cost of Implementation;  Cogni sant that the County 
Government has put measures in place to ensure Project Implementation meets  the required 
standards and that there  is  prudent use of Public Resources;  Appreciating that a colossal  amount 
of Savings has been made in the previous  Financial Year from Ward Projects Implementatio n; 
Notin g that the  Savings accrued from the Ward Projects are drawn from respective Ward Kitties ; 
Whereas  those Savings  if deposited in an account that could be used to fund additional Projects  in 
the respective Ward s;  
Now therefore , this House resolves that as a long-term strategy to enhance accountability  of Public 
Resources , the County Government creates  a Ward Project Savings Account after which the funds 
are rechanneled back to the respective Ward in a successful  Budgeting C ycle. I beg to give  the 
Notice of Motion.  
The Temporary Speaker  (Hon. Loise Kagecha): Thank you. Next order.
