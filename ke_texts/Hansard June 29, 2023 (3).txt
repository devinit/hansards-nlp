THE NAKURU COUNTY APPROPRIATRIONS BILL OF 2023(SECOND READING)
The Hon. Chairperson committee on Budget and Appropriations the Hon. Alex Mbugua
Hon. Alex Mbugua: Thank you Mr. Speaker sir; that the Nakuru County Appropriations Bill No. 6 of 2023 be now read a Second Time I ask Hon. Muraya to second.
Hon. Joseph Muraya: Mr Speaker, I do arise to second the Nakuru County Appropriations Bill No. 6 be now read a Second Time.
The Speaker (Hon. Joel Karuri): Thank you, the Motion is seconded, and the Motion is that the Nakuru County Appropriations Bill No. 6 be now read a Second Time. The Motion is open for debate.
Hon. Joseph Muraya: Mr. Speaker I think with your permission, I will seek from these Honourable Members that you put this into question because we are running out of time and the sugar levels are rising. We have not been here for quite a while so Mr. Speaker, even some Members are resting their eyes and therefore put it to question.
The Speaker (Hon. Joel Karuri): Order Hon Muraya. What is it the Hon. Minority Leader.
The Minority Leader (Hon. Philip Wanjohi): Now Mr. Speaker it is not that we are tired or running out of time and equally we are not asleep. We are very much awake and having had three sessions since morning, that shows the commitment we have as a House to deliberate on this. 
It is only that we have read the Bill, we have understood of course all of us went to school and that is why we are of the opinion that you put it to question but Mr. Speaker not that we are tired. We have all the energy even to continue up to midnight because we love the people of Nakuru that sent us to this Assembly. Thank you.
The Speaker (Hon. Joel Karuri): The Hon. Member for Naivasha East, you had a different opinion or the same?
Hon. Stanley Karanja: Mr. Speaker I was just seeking your indulgence on the same that we consume the first part of Hon Muraya but we ignore the explanation because it is not palatable to the House and it was overstretched for no reason at all.
The Speaker (Hon. Joel Karuri): Hon. Members, now you see the Bill when we recommit it to the Committee on Budget, the expectation is that the Committee would bring a Report back to this House in as way of discussing and debating maybe not in the manner we know for the longest time. 
But we are not able to commit certain Bills to a Committee and then now later come and put a question without having heard from the specific Committee. Maybe Chairperson you want to report to this House on what the Budget Committee found. 
Hon. Alex Mbugua: Mr. Speaker sir, this House through you Mr. Speaker, you sent the Committee for further deliberations and the Members of this House had expressed various things that they wanted clarification on and in that, we had the First Schedule additions that is on recurrent, Development Expenditure and then we had the Second Schedule on reductions for the purpose of ensuring that everything that this House required had been met. With that Mr. Speaker, the Report to this House is appropriately done. Thank you.
The Speaker (Hon. Joel Karuri): Thank you, Hon. Chair. I am going to put it to question.

We were able to receive an incomplete set of uniforms and probably we need to proceed and start the trainings. The Chairperson can explain to us, we got a Track Suit and we did not get the T- Shirt and we are wondering how we are going to put on our Track Suits without T- Shirts. We were also provided with a pair of shoes without socks. 
So the Chairperson can tell us where are the shorts for those who will be playing football because that is an incomplete set. We also need to have more details on what will take place tomorrow and the days thereafter. Sorry for interruption but I felt because we are not going to have another Special Sitting on the same, then the Chairperson for the Committee on Sports to give a clarification on what is ahead of us, thank you.
The Speaker (Hon. Joel Karuri): The Chairperson is in the House, I want to put it this way- that immediately after this session we are going to have a brief Kamukunji because there are things that we cannot introduce in this sitting but for the record it is important that the House is well briefed. Honorable Members this House stand adjourns until further time.
