STATEMENT S 
PREVALENCE OF HIV/ AIDS IN YOUTHS AND YOUNG MOTHERS IN NAKURU COUNTY . 
The Temporary  Speaker (Hon. Loise Kagecha):  There is a response to Statement  requested by 
Honorable Ann Wamaitha and  the response will be given by H onorable Njuguna Mwaura, the 
Chairperson  for the  Committee on Health Services  
Hon. Njuguna Mwaura:  Thank you Madam  Temporary  Speaker, I rise to respond to  Statement  
sought by Honorable Ann Wamaitha on prevalence of HIV and A IDS in Youths  and Young 
Mothers in Nakuru County. Madam  Speaker on  Wednesday 26th April,  2023, Hon. Ann Wamaitha, 
Special Elect MCA requested for a Statement  from the Chairperson Committee on Health Services 
concerning the prevalence of HIV/AIDS among youth and young mothers in Nakuru County.  
The Hon. Member requested for a detailed information on the measures that the County 
Department of Health Services has put in place to deal with the rising cases of HIV/AIDS in 
teenagers and young mothers in the County.  
The Committee  while undertaking its Legislative, Oversight  and Representation role wrote to the 
County Executive Committee Member Department of Health Services to get factual information 
on the question raised.  
On 4th May, 2023 the Department responded as follows;  
Areas covered in the response includes;  
• History of HIV/AIDS  
• HIV data both at National Vs Nakuru County.  
• HIV Prevalence by Sub Counties among Adults 15 -49years  
• Partne rs supporting HIV Program in Nakuru County  
• HIV Testing, Positivity and Teenage Pregnancy (January 2021 - March 2023)  
• HIV Testing, Positivity by Sub Counties Jan -December 2022  
• Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission  
• Challenges in achieving Elimination of  Mother to Child Transmission  
• What the County is doing to curb the Rising HIV/AIDS Infections among the youth and 
the young mothers in the County.  
 
History of HIV/AIDS   
HIV/AIDS continues to be a major Public Health challenge in Sub -Saharan Africa. Kenya’ s HIV 
epidemic has been the fourth largest worldwide in the last decade. For this reason, Kenya has been 
regarded globally as a priority Country  in Sub Saharan Africa to reverse the spread of HIV in the 
region.  
HIV/AIDS was first discovered in Kenya in 1984 through a Ugandan Journalist aged 34years who 
had lived in Nairobi for 4years but had travelled extensively. It is worth noting that, the Kenya’s 
epidemic curve has changed over time due to development from a Health  focus approach to 
Multisectoral  response coordinated by a single Nationa l authority known as National Aids Control 
Council, a single strategic framework and a single monitoring and evaluation framework. 
Increased availability of reliable and compreh ensive data has helped to focus on the importance of 
HIV transmission location and population in order to reduce new HIV Infection.  
In 1999 the Kenyan Government declared HIV pandemic a National  disaster requiring a Multi 
Sectoral Emergency Response and Measures to contain the situation. Kenya is committed to be on 
the pathway towards ending the AIDS Epidemic by the year 2030 in line with the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goal Number 3. The SDG goal no 3 is to ensure healthy lives and 
promote well -being for all at ages including a bold commitment to end the epidemics such as 
AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria and other Communicable  diseases by 2030. Kenya is also committed 
to meet the global targets of 95 -95-95. This means 95% of all people who are HIV Pos itive are 
identified, 95% of them started on ART, and 95% of those started on ART getting virally 
suppressed.  
The Kenyan Government has launched a number of HIV Programs in collaboration with other 
Development  Partners to manage the…… B AGNE pandemic . HIV response in Kenya is mainly 
funded by donors including the Global Fund and the United States Presidents ’ Fund for AIDS 
Relief. That is PEPFAR, who have continued to support the Program to date.  
According to the data released by the National Syndemic Disease Control Council, formerly 
National AIDS Control Council , the number of people living with HIV has changed over time. 
Anti-Retro Viral Therapy (ART) is a lifelong treatment which has helped to improve the quality 
of life for people living with HIV, and helping them to live longer. The number of people on ART 
has also increased over time. The milestones made over time in HIV response and the gains made 
throu gh different interventions are part of the journey towards Epidemic Control by 2030.  
The Pill Burden has also been reduced through science making it easy for the client to swallow 
one drug maybe once or twice a day,  unlike before where one could take a nu mber of pills at once. 
The development has also come with more efficacious drugs that are very effective ; drugs known 
as (Dolutegravir (DTG) ) which are taken  by children as well as adults in the correct  dosage.  
  
 
ii) HIV data both N ational versus Nakuru C ounty.  
The comparisons data on HIV Nationally versus Nakuru County as cited by the National ’s 
Syndemic Disease Control Council . That is from the indicator that is the National level and Nakuru 
County . HIV preval ence overall nationally  is 4.40 %. In Nakuru  it is 3.5 %; that means that we are 
doing poorly as a County and something ought to be done.  
HIV pre valence in male is 2.65% and in  Nakuru it  is 1.6%. HIV pre valence  in females , that is 
where actually we have a problem ; It is 5.3% nationally and in Nakuru it is 4.6% , and I request 
our sisters who are here through the Women Caucus , to take lead in addressing this issue because 
it is a pandemic in our county, a nd if you can compare statistically , it means Nakuru we are doing 
poorly as far as the preva lence in females is concerned. There are many biological explanations as 
to why this is so, but we really need to do something as far as this is concerned.  
Mother To Child Transmission rate, it is 8.9% nationally, in Nakuru it is 11% and I really want to 
reiterate  this and also to request our sisters also that they have a lot to do so that they can  actually  
move around and sensiti se the population that we have, so that we can reduce this gap. A mother 
To Child Transmission of 11 % in Nakuru County, it means we are doing poorly . It is like we are 
leading in Nakuru because nationally it is 8.9% but here it is 11%.  
New  infections total nationally it is that 34540 . In Nakuru new infections are 1496.  Number  of 
people livin g with HIV by 2022 was 1  437 267 ; in Nakuru there are 58,678 . That means we are 
not doing well and urgent measures ought to be put in place.  
Total  number of people on ARVs/ARTs is 1  128 796 and the  number of people living on ARTs in 
Nakuru is 38  250 that is by 2021 , but by March 2022 there were 44,874 . That means there is a 
number of individuals who are not going for these drugs and measures ought to be put in place.  
Number  of people on ARTs by sex is male nationally is 348  408. Female, it is 694 913. In Nakuru, 
those who are living on ARTs are 10  671 men and  females 36  472. That means that there under 
the natural rate and socially Madam  Temporary Speaker, is that men do not go to hospitals and 
they fear, I do not know if they fea r injections or what is that  they fear, but men are not known for 
going to  hospitals. And by so doing therefore men, and I believe that honorable Degualle  who can 
be the Male Caucus Chairperson, we ought also to tell our men to be going to hospitals so tha t they 
can at least get to know their status and thereafter they be collecting drugs so that they can live 
normal lives. Currently, there are a lot of improvements as far as the ARTs are concerned and 
therefore that can really assist.  
Nationally, n umber  of persons on ARTs at age 0 to 14  are 68  505 and i n Nakuru, they are 2  146. 
Virally  suppressed male is 348  408 and female it is 807  576. 
Overall  in Nakuru by March 2023, they were 97% . That is 97% of the total number of individuals 
who are living with HIV. Adults were 97% children were 93%.  
 Number  of AIDS  related deaths nationally  are 22  373 and in Nakuru, they were 1  332. 
Hon. Njuguna Mwaura:  
iii) HIV Prevalence by Sub Counties among adults 15 -49years  
Below is the table indicating the HIV prevalence by the Sub -Counties among adults 15 -49years as 
cited by the Kenya Health Information System. The HIV prevalence at Nakuru County is at 3.5%.

 Njoro     133,728  3.2%  
 Molo      89,913  2.9%  
 
We need a lot of focus in Nakuru West. Attention needs to be given there by Honorable Members 
and the Executive so that they can try to sensitize the members of the public on the same.

vii) Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission  
The County has a total of 2,470 mothers supposed to get PMTCT Services, however only 1,801 
mothers have been reached. At the same time for the HIV exposed infants, the number is at 1,801 
but the Department had managed to reach 1,759.  
viii) Challenges in achieving Elimination of Mother to Child Transmission  
•Erratic Commodity supply - for testing the mothers for HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B (Triple 
Elimination). Therefore, there is inadequate suppl y of those drugs that are supposed actually assist 
our mothers not to have mother to child transmission.  
•Availability of equipment for Infant Testing in the County (only done at National Labs) there are 
no labs actually that are able to test the infants. therefore, that is a challenge because we cannot be 
able now going to suppress the viral load to the infants.  
•Inadequate funds to support Community PMTCT through CHVs and Mentor Mothers.  
•Inadequate PMTCT sites as a result of inadequate staffing (Trained  HCWs) at the county.  
•Low male Involvement. Men are not going to the hospital and are not involved in this venture as 
they usually do not go actualy for pre -natal services or during post -natal services.  
•Non -adherence to treatment due to psychological/HIV associated stigma issues.  
ix) What the County is doing to curb the Rising HIV/AIDS Infections among Adolescents and 
Teenage Mothers  
The department of health services has employed the following ways to reduce the increasing 
numbers of inf ection.  
•Offering age appropriate HIV Adolescents and Young Persons prevention Package through 
Behaviour Change & Communication (Behaviour Change and Communication) ABC, Pre -
exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) - that is when a youth can go to the hospital and confi rm that yesterday 
they had a covetous or they had they were actually having it without protection, or there was an 
accident, they are given pre -exposure or prophylaxis drugs. Post exposure Prophylaxis (PEP), 
Sexual Reproductive Health education and Service s. 
•Ongoing ‘BINTI’ Shujaa Program for young mothers (130ambasssadors manning 180 support 
groups of 10each -below 19years of age) - integrated PREP in Binti Shujaa.  
•Quarterly Adolescents and Young Persons - Technical Working Group Meeting and support 
supervi sion.    
•Operationali sation of Operation Triple Zero (OTZ) and OTZ champions.  
•Sensiti sation of youth leaders on Youth Friendly Services. On this I want to encourage the Women 
Caucus  and also the Youth Caucus , they can take advantage of that program and t hey can create 
weekend programs where they can meet with our youth centres and I believe each and every 
facility ought to have a youth friendly centre where Waheshimiwa from that area can call all the 
youth actually to be educated on these matters and can be sensiti sed on this matter. The other issue 
is; 
•Identification of Youth Champions leading youth activities on HIV Prevention.  
•Decentrali sation of PrEP and condoms to increase access. I remember there was a time there was 
an outcry that there were no co ndoms at our dispensaries or our facilities but we want to sensiti se 
that all the facilities and all public areas should have condom dispensers and they should be refiled 
every now and then. Nowadays we do not call them condom dispensers Madam  Temporary  
Speaker; we call them ATM because that is a n agreeable term for our youth whereby they can go 
and withdraw and engage in their ventures or activities comfortably without exposing themselves.  
•Mobili sation of Community for Change; that is community members  must actually appreciate the 
programs that the County and the National Government are in place  putting towards making sure 
that we eradicate the exposures of our population against  the HIV.  
•Meaningful engagement with Children’s Office, Orphans and Vulnerable Children  Programs to 
educate the public on their vulnerability. Therefore Madam  Temporary  Speaker, I believe that we 
have responded to these issues and I call upon this House to take  the lead on these issues of HIV 
and Aids. We can be ambassadors and  we can disseminate  information at different forums that we 
usually have as leaders so that we sensiti se the members of public on the issues of this menace , 
and I can tell you Madam  Temporary  Speaker, that if we go that route, we are going to save if not 
all, many because this menace is not going away anytime  soon because I do not know  it is because 
of the sociali sation, the issue of social media, the issue of social status of our communities actually 
things are getting out of hand and we actually need to d eal with it.  
Madam  Temporary  Speaker I want to tell you also that the youth  today usually say they better get 
HIV rather than becoming pregnant and this is a notion that has been created around these areas. 
Therefore, we really need to do a lot. There is also an issue of defilement and th e cases have  really 
increased in our County and we really need to do something on the same so that those who will be 
defiling our children, they ought to be incarcerated and t hey ought to be given a longer sentence  
than the 14 years that is given by our Penal Codes.  
We really need to engage in that venture and I wish that the Women Caucus can take lead on that 
because both male and female children are at the hands of our women and therefore Women 
Caucus ought to ta ke lead and save our generation. I beg to give that Statement . Thank you Madam  
Temporary  Speaker.  
The Temporary  Speaker  (Hon. Loise Kagecha): Thank you the Hon. Njuguna for that elaborate 
presentation. At this juncture I would like to call upon Hon. Ann Wa maitha to confirm to us 
whether she is satisfied with that response to the Statement  she requested.  
Hon. Ann Wamaitha:  Thank you Madam Temporary  Speaker . Quite indeed the Report  has 
answered all my questions; and from the Report , it evident that there is a  crisis  because,  how is it 
possible that Mother to Child Transmission in HIV we are leading nationally? How is it that our 
mothers , our daughters are leading in terms of HIV infection nationally? Madam  Temporary  
Speaker, I we do not support the County to undertake the challenges that it is having in prevention 
this case, we shall be termed as that ‘County of HIV’.  
It is high time that we c ame up with a campaign as a Nakuru County to ensure that this infection 
rate by next time they are having statistics , that we can have a digit line in terms of our statistics 
Madam  Temporary  Speaker. There is a cry out there that we are being termed as the ‘ County of 
HIV’ ; how is that possible? Therefore, I support the Health Se rvices Committee and our Chair that 
we should take lead of this Report  and encourage our youth and our mothers, our fathers, our sons 
to go out there and get tested, go out there and prevent themselves from HIV infections. Thank 
you Madam  Temporary  Speaker . 
The Temporary  Speaker (Hon. Loise Kagecha): There being no other business;
