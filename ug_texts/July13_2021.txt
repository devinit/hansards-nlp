COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you to today’s sitting. We had to restrict access to the building for 14 days because we had to disinfect it because of COVID-19. Thank you for cooperating with us. I welcome you back and request you to observe the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), so that we remain safe.

As indicated on the Order Paper, a motion will be moved to increase the membership of both the standing and sectoral committees to allow all the Members get accommodated in the committees, as per the Rules of Procedure of Parliament.

In a related development, as you may be aware, rule 69 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament stipulates the procedure for consideration of a motion to amend the rules. The rule, inter alia, requires a five-day notice to amend the Rules of Procedure of Parliament and referral of the motion to the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline. Because of that, hon. Ssemujju will move a motion in respect of rule 69. This is not practical at the moment because the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline is not yet in place. That is why we are moving a motion on rule 69.

Since the Speaker is committed to many other parliamentary duties, I have assigned hon. Zijjan David Livingstone, Member of Parliament for Butembe County, to assist the Speaker as dean of independents in the Parliament work. In exercise of my powers, under rule 8 I have delegated him to present the Independent Members of Parliament in today’s sitting.

Honourable members, in today’s sitting, we shall also have nominees for backbench Commissioners tabled for election by the House. This will be done by the respective whips.

As you may be aware, most of our business comes from Government. We now have a fully constituted Government and Cabinet. Today’s Order Paper is largely about designation of Members to committees; let us focus on that.

I have received many notifications on matters of national importance. Those shall be considered in tomorrow’s sitting. All Members who have matters of national importance should present them tomorrow, after we have heard a statement from the Prime Minister and Leader of Government Business, under Rule 41 of the Rules of Procedure. We shall have a question-and-answer session under the Prime Minister’s Time. This is meant to be on Thursdays but we have brought it to Wednesday because on Thursday, we have a Business Committee sitting.

As part of the steps taken by the Parliamentary Commission to mitigate the threat of COVID-19, there will be routine tests for Members and staff prior to the sitting of the House. This will be a regular requirement. I urge Members to adhere whenever called upon because of this COVID-19 pandemic. Let us not take COVID-19 like it is something easy; it is real and is killing so many people.

Honourable members, in the exercise of the powers given to the Speaker under Rule 8 of the Rules of Procedure, and pursuant to Article 79 of the Constitution, I appointed a COVID-19 taskforce that is mandated to carry out an oversight role on behalf of Parliament. That was done when we were in recess. We could not simply wait and see what was happening. I appointed them and we will refer the matter to the Business Committee that is sitting on Thursday. As Parliament, we needed to be seen to be working and we are working. I must appreciate the committee; it is doing very good work.

If we had a Business Committee in place, it would have approved the taskforce but we did not have it. However, we are going to have it after today’s session and we will make sure this is sent to the Business Committee.

Honourable members, the Business Committee is sitting on Thursday, 15 July 2021 at 11.00 a.m. in the Parliamentary Conference Hall. This serves to notify the members of the Business Committee accordingly.

Honourable members, I received the following names of Members that the respective parties have designated to international bodies and delegations:

Inter Parliamentary Union

Hon. Patrick Nsanja
Hon. Alex Ruhunda
Hon. Nancy Acora
Hon. Susan Amero
Hon. Abdul Mutumba
Hon. Mohammed Kato
Hon. Flavia Kalule

Commonwealth Parliamentary Association

Hon. Enosi Asiimwe
Hon. Baroda Kayaga
Hon. David Kalwanga
Hon. David Kabanda

ACP-EU

Hon. Samuel Opio.
Hon. Maurice Kibalya.
Hon. Theodore Ssekikubo.

Organisation of Islamic Conference

1.	Hon. Bashir Lubega.

Representatives to the Parliamentary Pension Board of Trustees

Hon. Arinaitwe Rwakajara
Hon. Aisha Kabanda.

Since the last sitting, we have lost so many Ugandans of different walks of life, including many prominent Ugandans, some of whom are loved ones to our honourable Members of Parliament. Notable among them is hon. Aggrey Awori, an eminent Ugandan economist, former ambassador, politician and an Olympian too. He served as a Constituent Assembly delegate, represented Samia Bugwe North in the Sixth Parliament, and served as Minister of Information and Communication Technology in Uganda. 

We condole with all the Ugandans who have lost their loved ones. I request, as representatives of the people of Uganda, that we rise and observe a moment of silence.

(Members rose and observed a moment of silence.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, before we receive the motion from the Government Chief Whip, we need to suspend rule 69. I, therefore, invite hon. Ssemujju. I would like Members to appreciate, as I said, that today we are designating Members to committees. We will come with all the procedural matters and matters of national importance tomorrow.

Before hon. Ssemujju comes in, I would like to announce that we are replacing hon. Anifa Kawooya with hon. Caroline Kamusiime as our representative to the Pan-African Parliament (PAP).

THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Mr Mathias Mpuuga): Madam Speaker, thank you for your indulgence. I just want to put it on record that the Opposition – on ACP-EU and the Islamic Conference – is finalising consultations to designate Members. We shall be informing Parliament in the next few days.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I will be waiting for the names.

2.56
MR IBRAHIM SSEMUJJU (FDC, Kira Municipality, Wakiso): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I rise to move a motion under rule 16 of our Rules of Procedure.

“WHEREAS rule 161 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament provides that each standing committee, apart from the Business Committee, Budget Committee and the Appointments Committee, shall comprise not less than 15 members and not more than 35 Members of Parliament selected in accordance with the rules;

AND WHEREAS rule 188(1) of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament provides that a sectoral committee shall consist of not less than 15 members and not more than 30 members selected from among Members of Parliament;

AWARE THAT the total number of Members of Parliament has increased from 443 in the Tenth Parliament to 529 in the Eleventh Parliament, making it impossible to meet the specific requirements under rule 157(3), which provides that a Member shall not belong to more than two committees, given the limits specified in the composition of standing and sectoral committees under rules 161, 163, 173(1) and 188(1) of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament;

REALISING THAT there is urgent need to amend the rules on composition of committees to accommodate the increased numbers of Members;

NOTING, HOWEVER, THAT under rule 69, a motion to amend the Rules of Procedure of Parliament must be presented after giving not less than five days’ notice and after being proposed, it shall stand referred to the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline and no further proceedings shall be taken on it until the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline reports;

AWARE THAT the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline itself is not yet constituted, and given that there is need to amend the provisions on the composition of committees to enable every Member belong to a committee;

APPRECIATING, THEREFORE, THAT there is need to suspend rule 69 to dispense with the requirement of the five days’ notice and the referral to the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline to enable the whole House to consider a motion to amend the Rules of Procedure;

NOW, THEREFORE, this Parliament resolves that rule 69 is hereby suspended to enable the House to urgently consider a motion to amend the Rules of Procedure to determine the composition of standing and sectoral committees.”

I beg to move, Madam Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is the motion on suspension of rule 69, moved by hon. Ssemujju Ibrahim, seconded? Would you like to speak to your motion?

MR SSEMUJJU: Madam Speaker, in fact, the whole House should have supported this motion. Not doing so would mean that you have no committees to belong to. 

We had a meeting as whips to designate Members of Parliament to committees as the rules require, but we hit a snag. This is because the limitation is that you cannot have more than 35 Members of Parliament on a standing committee, yet as I have noted, the number of MPs has increased from 400 to now 529. If we strictly abide by that rule, it means that there will be Members who will not belong to a committee.

Therefore, this motion is more procedural; we must find room to accommodate all of us, and then we begin transacting the business of Parliament.

This motion simply invites you to use one of the rules of Parliament to suspend the requirement that to amend Rules of Procedure, you have to give a five-day notice. That being the case, even the committee to which the notice must be referred - the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline – is not constituted. It is also affected by the circumstances.

Therefore, I would like to limit my justification to circumstances that I think are easy for everybody to notice. We are unable to proceed with the business of designating Members to committees because the requirement under the rule catered for the last Parliament; it did not cater for this Parliament that has increased by nearly 100 Members of Parliament. 

Honourable members, that being the case, I would like to invite all of you to support this motion, so that we can designate Members to committees and they process work on behalf of Parliament.

Madam Speaker, I would like to end here. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to present this motion. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, hon. Ibrahim Ssemujju. Can I have the seconder, hon. Sseggona Medard, and then we will have hon. Okot, who is the whip for the Democratic Party.

3.03
MR MEDARD LUBEGA-SSEGGONA (NUP, Busiro County East, Wakiso): Madam Speaker and honourable members, I rise to second the motion moved by the honourable Member for Kira Municipality. The reasons have been given.

However, I would invite the House as well to look at rule 188(1) in considering this motion. It caters for sectoral committees as well, which will equally be affected. It places a ceiling that a sectoral committee shall consist of not less than 15 members and not more than 30 members selected from Members of Parliament. 

Madam Speaker, with your permission, I would pray that we cater for this in the proposed motion, and therefore consider the motion amended to that extent. Thank you. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, hon. Sseggona. Can I have a seconder from the Government side? 

3.05
THE GOVERNMENT CHIEF WHIP (Mr Thomas Tayebwa): Thank you, Madam Speaker. This is a motion which all sides of the political divide in the House sat and agreed to because as whips, we had hit a snag. A very good example is that I would have 47 Members on my side who would not be members of standing committees if we were to follow the rules strictly.

Therefore, I would like to request colleagues that we do not waste much time; we should move and approve this motion. I beg to move.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Can I have hon. Opendi and we close it.

3.05
MS SARAH OPENDI (NRM, Woman Representative, Tororo): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I do support the motion. I would like to mention that these Rules of Procedure were passed by this Parliament in the Tenth Parliament. This issue had been brought up by the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline; unfortunately, Members did not appreciate what the committee was talking about. 

Equally, another issue that was brought to this House and discussed was to increase the number of committees. There are certain committees that are loaded with a lot of work and are not able to even accomplish the task at hand. Look at the Committee on Public Accounts (Local Governments) and the Committee on Commissions, Statutory Agencies and State Enterprises (COSASE), which has very many statutory bodies to oversee. The Committee on Public Accounts (Local Governments) has the cities, 149 districts, sub-counties and town councils –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Opendi, you will bring that as a motion. 

MS OPENDI: Thank you. I do support the motion, but my proposal is that once the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline is fully constituted, it should equally look at these committees that are loaded so that they can be split. This will allow Members to meaningfully make contributions to those state enterprises, districts and the various committees that they oversee. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline should take note. Once fully constituted, there are matters that you should handle urgently.

I now put the question that the motion be adopted.

(Question put and agreed to.)

MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT TO AMEND THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF PARLIAMENT

3.08
THE GOVERNMENT CHIEF WHIP (Mr Thomas Tayebwa): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I move this motion under rule 56 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament, for a resolution of Parliament to amend the Rules of Procedure of Parliament to determine the membership and composition of standing and sectoral committees.

“WHEREAS Article 90(1) and (2) of the Constitution provides that Parliament shall appoint committees necessary for the efficient discharge of its functions and that Parliament shall, by its Rules of Procedure, prescribe the powers, composition and functions of its committees;

AND WHEREAS under rule 156 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament, the House shall, in accordance with Article 90 of the Constitution, appoint committees of Parliament necessary for the efficient discharge of its functions;

AWARE that under rules 160 and 188 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament, members of standing committees and sectoral committees are selected from among Members of Parliament and as far as is reasonably practicable, the overall membership of these committees must reflect the proportionalmembership in the House, taking into consideration the numerical strength of the parties and the interests of the independent Members; 

AWARE THAT rule 161 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament provides that each standing committee, apart from the Business Committee, the Budget Committee and the Appointments Committee, shall comprise not less than 15 members and not more than 35 members selected in accordance with the rules; 

NOTING THAT rule 188(1) of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament provide that a sectoral committee shall consist of not less than 15 members and not more than 30 members selected from among Members of Parliament; 

FURTHER NOTING that the total number of Members of Parliament has increased from 442 in the Tenth Parliament to 529 in the Eleventh Parliament, making it impossible to meet the specific requirement under rule 157(3), which provides that a Member shall not belong to more than two committees, given the limit specified on the composition of standing committees and sectoral committees under Rules 161, 163, 173(1), 188(1) of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament; 

APPRECIATING that due to the increase in the total number of Members of Parliament and for Parliament to efficiently discharge its functions, there is need to amend the Rules of Procedure of Parliament to remove the limits with respect to the membership of standing committees and composition of sectoral committees respectively, to have each Member of Parliament belong to a committee of Parliament and further to allow for equal numbers in each standing or sectoral committee; 

NOW, THEREFORE, be it resolved by Parliament that rules 161, 163, 173(1) and 188(1) of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament be amended as follows: 

Under rule 161 - membership of standing committees - substitute the rule with the following:
	‘161. Membership of Standing Committees 
	Subject to these rules, all standing committees, except the Business Committee, shall as far as is reasonably practicable, comprise of the same number of members selected in accordance with Rule 160.’ 

2. 	Delete rule 163, which is about composition of the Committee on Appointments.

3. 	Under rule 173, which is about composition and functions of the Committee on Budget, delete sub-rule (1). 

4. Under rule 188, composition of sectoral committees, substitute rule 188(1) with the following: 
‘(1) All sectoral committees shall, as far as is reasonably practicable, comprise of the same number of members selected in accordance with these rules.’” 

Madam Speaker and members, I beg to move. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is the motion seconded? 

(Motion seconded.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: It is seconded by hon. Nambeshe, hon. Sseggona, hon. Zaake, hon. Attan, hon. Kabanda and many other Members of Parliament. Can you speak to your motion? Let us not take a lot of time because designation is going to take a little more time. 

MR TAYEBWA: You are absolutely right, Madam Speaker. These are the issues we have been discussing. This motion will solve the issue of amending our Rules of Procedure every time the number of Members of Parliament increases or decreases, as the case may be. 

Like I told you, I have been facing a dilemma of 47 Members not being designated to any committee. The moment we pass this motion, we shall move very well as party whips because Members will have the confidence that once they are voted, they will belong to a committee. 

With that, I request Members to support this motion. Thank you. 

3.14 
THE CHIEF OPPOSITION WHIP (Mr John Baptist Nambeshe): Madam Speaker, I come to throw my full weight behind this motion for a resolution of this Parliament to amend the Rules of Procedure to determine the membership and composition of the standing and sectoral committees. 

Rule 188(3) is as clear as day. It says, “…the overall membership of the committees shall reflect the proportional membership in the House.” The termhere is “proportional membership”. This would require us to apply the arithmetic formula of direct proportion – not inverse. The inverse proportion would require that when a quantity increases, the other quantity decreases and vice versa. 

In direct proportion, if you choose to pay three times more for the items you normally pay for, it is therefore compelling that you will pay three times as much money. The price you pay for the increase on the items you have bought should be directly proportional to the amount of money you are going to pay. 

The price that this 11th Parliament is paying is because the 10th Parliament, in its wisdom, generated new constituencies. It is in the 10th Parliament where we had a membership of 443 but now, in the 11th Parliament, we have 529. That is a variance of a whooping 89 Members. 

Madam Speaker, if we were to maintain the status quo on standing committees, the minimum limit would be 15 and the maximum limit 35. Equally, on sectoral committees, the minimum would be 15 and the maximum 30. If we were to maintain that status quo, as the rules provided then, we would be in a dilemma as to where to accommodate the rest of the Members on these committees. 

The sober bit in this motion is that it is not seeking to increase the number of committees. It is only seeking to remove those limits, and this is because of popular demand. It is bi-partisan and it has support across the political divide. It is not like the other unpopular limits which were removed by the previous parliaments. 

Madam Speaker, if I take you down memory lane, you will remember that the Seventh Parliament removed the presidential five-year term limit and it was very unpopular. However, this is a numerical limit, which we would want to remove - and it is very popular - so that we accommodate more Members on these committees. 

Equally, in the 10th Parliament, the controversial removal of the presidential age limit, which was – 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Kindly limit yourself to the Rules of Procedure.  

MR NAMBESHE: Madam Speaker, these particular limits, which I am beseeching Parliament to remove, are popular because they are about accommodating Members of Parliament so that they can efficiently discharge their functions. 

Madam Speaker, I would like to thank you and the Members and implore them to support this motion. I beg to submit. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, we are amending the Rules of Procedure and not the Constitution. Thank you very much, Chief Opposition Whip. Hon. Allan Ssewanyana. Limit the time; I am giving you two minutes.

3.19
MR ALLAN SSEWANYANA (NUP, Makindye Division West, Kampala): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I support the motion moved by hon. Tayebwa, but with only a few changes. His proposal is about leaving the number open. However, we are going to witness a scenario in future, which may not be very far, where a committee of Parliament is having the same number of members as former Parliaments - for example, 100 Members on a committee of Parliament.

Therefore, we should limit the number the way we are doing now, so that we give a chance to the next Parliament to see if it will be worthwhile for them to increase or decrease the numbers. We are always urged as Members of Parliament and Government to work on decreasing the size of Parliament because it creates so many problems, like the one we are now solving. That is my submission, Madam Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, hon. Ssewanyana. The essence behind leaving it open is that we are not only legislating for today but also for tomorrow. Assuming in the next term we have 1000 Members, what happens? 

3.21
MR GILBERT OLANYA (FDC, Kilak South County, Amuru): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to borrow from hon. Ssewanyana’s argument. Leaving it open is very risky for the future. Members may not hope to belong to particular committees; what will happen then? For example, if Members do not want to be on the committee –(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: There is a point of procedure. Before, the procedural matter comes in, I need to inform the House that all of you were represented in yesterday’s meeting by your whips. You all belong somewhere, especially hon. Olanya and hon. Ssewanyana - you belong to the Opposition and your whip was there and he spoke for you.

MR SSEMUJJU: Madam Speaker, I would like to raise a procedural issue. My two colleagues seem to be debating a motion that has not been moved. The motion that has been moved provides a formula so that even if you are three MPs, you divide yourselves by the number of committees. If you are 10,000 MPs, like is likely to be as long as you have the NRM in power, you divide them.

Therefore, the procedural issue I am raising is whether the MPs should debate a motion that has not been moved and divert this Parliament from debating a motion that is very specific - providing a formula that you use regardless of the number and size of Parliament?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Actually, the mover of the motion talked about the numerical strength and size of Parliament. Basing on that, honourable members, I now put the question for a resolution of Parliament to amend rule 161 and rule 181(1) of the Rules of Procedure.

(Question put and agreed to.)

DESIGNATION OF MEMBERS TO STANDING COMMITTEES AND SECTORAL COMMITTEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULES 160 AND 187 OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: We are designating Members to several committees. We have standing committees and sectoral committees. We are going to start with standing committees. The rules say that the Speaker shall present the names but the Speaker equally has powers to delegate.  

I, therefore, delegate the Government Chief Whip to read for Government, the Chief Opposition Whip for the Opposition, the dean of the independents for the independent Members, and then the head of the Uganda Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF) to read the UPDF list. Can we start with standing committees?

MR SSEWUNGU: Madam Speaker, the procedural matter I am raising is that as the UPDF comes up to designate its members, we should share them across the House - five should seat on the Opposition side and five on NRM side. (Laughter)

Madam Speaker, they are non-partisan, but whenever we are here, UPDF representatives are put on the side of NRM. Wouldn’t it be procedurally right that this time we have five UPDF on the Opposition side and five on the NRM side, and actually they should always vote on our side. Thank you, Madam Speaker. (Laughter)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Ssewungu, the UPDF are non-partisan. For now, before we have our new chamber, we have free sitting. If you want, you can go and sit on the other side near the Government Chief Whip. Can we have the Government Chief Whip? 

3.26
THE GOVERNMENT CHIEF WHIP (Mr Thomas Tayebwa): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I start with the Committee on Budget. On this committee, the Government side has designated the following Members:

Honourable members, you have listened to the list of members constituting the Committee of Budget. I put the question that the House confirms the names of those Members to the committee.

MR MACHO: Madam Speaker, with all due respect, I am blessed that I was a Member of Parliament in the 10th Parliament and we had so many issues of human rights concerning the UPDF.

4.16
MR DAVID ZIJJAN (Independent, Butembe County, Jinja): Committee on Government Assurances and Implementation, Madam Speaker.

Hon. Mohammad Nsereko, Kampala Central Division.

MR NSEREKO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker and honourable colleague for giving way. Honourable members, I invite you on a point of procedure under our rules, Rule 160(4) of our Rules of Procedure.

Madam Speaker, our rules on the constitution of standing committees as regards independent members of Parliament are very clear - and they state, “independent Members of Parliament under sub rule (4) shall apply to the Clerk to join committees of their choice.” The key word therein is “shall” and the Speaker shall accordingly ensure that the Members join the committee of their choice.

Madam Speaker, we had three choices in our application and I tendered my application in the Office of the Clerk, and indicated the following committees in pecking order. The Standing Committee I chose was the Public Accounts Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises (COSASE). My second choice was the Committee on Climate Change and the third was the Committee on Public Accounts. I have heard none of the above reading my name. 

Madam Speaker, the reason we converge towards you as Independent members of Parliament is to secure our choices because they are premised on the aspirations of the people that voted for us. My desire to serve on an accountability committee is based on the notion of vouching for accountability in performance of state enterprises.

Therefore, never was I consulted for this decision to be arrived at or as Independents, we have not even had a shade to sit and share. Probably, all of us would mitigate through ourselves and decide where to give in and where to leave.

The purpose of our coming here is to perform. We have no doubt every Member can perform but your best performance is where you are best suited in ability to deliver to your people through committees and plenary.

My humble prayer is that let our prayers be heard. When someone seeks choices, there is a reason they do so. It is for better performance in this august House. Empathetically, if it were you or any other person, you would do the same as I to come and seek equity. I am here before you to seek that. At least, I should have been consulted but not to be tossed around into a committee that I had no choice over.

Madam Speaker, unless you are dragging me by force into this committee, you will find my service and that of the people of Kampala may not be best suited in that nature.

Wherefore, I pray that you indulge in this and we be called upon. The Dean is my good friend and I cannot doubt his judgment but we, as Independents, should sit and harmonise. There is no rush; we can go onto the committees much later. That is why we welcomed the motion of the expansion of committees so that we cater for capability, abilities and also public performance –(Member timed out.) – Thank you. I have brought the matter to the whole House because I did not get the opportunity –

The Deputy Speaker: Honourable member, your issue has been heard. Much as we are mindful of the performance of members of Parliament, as we were coming here, we did not say we must be in this committee. Mindful of the fact that the committees are limited and we are many, bear with us for now and we form the committees. We will change during the course of the second term. The committees were over-subscribed. The whips or the Dean of the Independents has a right to move a Member to another committee.

Dean, can you continue?

Mr nsereko: Madam Speaker, just a second. This is a command of the law and not your opinion. The law commands you that Independent Members shall apply. I did that. The command to you is that the Speaker “shall”. The word “shall” is very instrumental. There is nowhere in these rules that it states that a Dean can alter – the only rule talks about whips –

The Deputy Speaker: Honourable member, can we sort that out?

Mr nsereko: This is the law. I am not quoting air – 

The Deputy Speaker: If you want to opt out of the committee, well and good.

Mr nsereko: Madam Speaker, there must be a procedure, which is prescribed by law.

The Deputy Speaker: Honourable member, can we have the designation done? 

Mr okin: Madam Speaker, I would like to first say that the honourable member who has just spoken is actually right but I am raising a point of order. The law stipulates very clearly that designation of Members of Parliament, especially the Independents, shall be done by the Clerk and the Speaker. If the Speaker has designated this responsibility to the Dean of the Independents, is the honourable member right to challenge the decision you have made?

The Deputy Speaker: Honourable member, we have heard your issue. Can we continue with the Dean?

Mr zijjan: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Our rules also provide for relocation of Members from committees and so, I would like to advise honourable colleagues with similar sentiments that this is a matter we can follow up and rectify.

Committee on Government Assurances and Implementation:

Hon. Muhammad Nsereko –Kampala Central Division, Kampala.

The Deputy Speaker: Hon. Okot, can you have a seat.

Mr zijjan:  
Hon. Bahireira Tumwekwase Sylvia – Woman Representative, Kamwenge.
Hon. Mukasa Julius Opondo – Bujumba County, Kalangala.
Hon. Ameede Agnes –  Woman Representative, Butebo.
Hon. Akugizibwe Aled Ronald – Buruuli County, Masindi
Hon. Nakayenze Connie Galiwango - Woman Representative Mbale City.

I beg to designate.

The Deputy Speaker: Hon. Muhammad Nsereko, we have taken note of your issue. We are going to adjust to that and to so many other Members who have issues; the whips must sit down and amend the lists and bring back to this House. 

Mr nsereko: Most obliged, Madam Speaker. Therefore, the motion must read, “With amendments” because I know –

The Deputy Speaker: For now, we are putting the motion with amendments. 

Mr nsereko: Okay.

4.27
Ms charity BEINABABO (UPDF): Madam Speaker, the Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF) is not designating anybody to the Committee on Government Assurances and Implementation. Thank you. 

The Deputy Speaker: Honourable members, you have listened to the list of Members constituting the Committee on Government Assurances and Implementation. We have had amendments on it. I, therefore, put the question that this House confirms the names of Members who have been mentioned, with amendments.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Procedure

MR NSEREKO: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise on the point of procedure-

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Under which rule?

MR NSEREKO: Under the rule of privilege- that we have heard submission and designation of Commissioners whose role is to take care of the welfare of Members in this august House.


Madam Speaker, I would like to seek your intervention whether it would not be procedurally right that these Commissioners come and stand before us so that we know them. 

We are more than 500 Members and the Members that have been mentioned, you might probably find that we do not actually know them- so that on every single matter, we do not have to run to your office but first approach our commissioners. It is my humble request that through your intervention that the Commissioners step forward so that they are known to us in the House and we approve them accordingly. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, we have four Commissioners whose names have been read. The Member’s concern is genuine. You will find that we do not know these Commissioners and yet they are supposed to be in-charge of the welfare of Members- can the Commissioners stand from where they are so that Members see you. I can see hon. Zaake and hon. Silwany there. Where are the other commissioners? Hon. Prossy is there coming. Where is hon. Afoyochan? We need an acceptance from you that you are going to serve this House. A minute each, on the microphone. 

6.07
MR SOLOMON SILWANY (NRM, Bukooli County Central, Bugiri): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I want to take this opportunity to thank my party, the National Resistance Movement, for giving me the opportunity to serve. Members of this Parliament, I request you – (Interruption)

MR ATTAN: My name is Moses Attan, Member of Parliament, Soroti East Division. I rise on a procedural matter. Since we have not yet approved the Commissioners, is it procedurally right that they accept before – 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Your procedure is on which rule? For us, we want to know the Commissioner. Commissioner, can you just greet your members? 

MR SILWANY: Madam Speaker, I was seeking support from the House, and asking members to support my approval. I will always be there for you, honourable members.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next commissioner.

6.09
MS PROSSY AKAMPURIRA (NRM, Woman Representative, Rubanda): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. For the honourable members who do not know me, my name is Prossy Akampurira, Woman Representative, Rubanda District.

I also want to kindly request fellow members to support me so that I can support you, and you will see a strong Parliament. Thank you very much.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, hon. Prossy Akampurira. 

6.09
MS ESTHER AFOYOCHAN (NRM, Woman Representative, Zombo): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am called Esther Afoyochan, Woman Representative, Zombo. Honourable colleagues, just like you know me, I also want to have an opportunity to know you better. We can only do that as we serve. I am here to seek for your support. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Hon. Zaake.

6.09
MR FRANCIS ZAAKE (NUP, Mityana Municipality): Thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: You can just greet people because they know you.

MR ZAAKE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am Francis Zaake, Member of Parliament representing people of Mityana Municipality, and I belong to the National Unity Platform. I think all honourable members here know me. I am here to give you service and I will always be there to serve you because I understand the importance of this. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, hon. Zaake. Honourable members, the four members to serve on the Parliamentary Commission have been designated by different parties. I now put the question that the members, whose names have been designated to serve as Members of the Parliamentary Commission, be approved. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: We now have the four Commissioners.

MS OGWAL: Madam Speaker, I think many of us have become acquainted with the Rules of Procedure, which commands Parliament to ensure two things:

A total of 40 per cent of the leadership of Parliament must be women; and

 We must ensure that all political shades are accommodated in the composition of the leadership. I am particularly interested in the Commission.

I know that the party in Government takes the lion’s share. I also know that the Opposition has some slot. However, we are increasingly getting more Independent members in the House yet their interests aren’t being taken care of unlike when it comes to their designation to the international platforms like the Pan African Parliament and others. 

The Parliamentary Commission is very important organ because it takes care of the welfare of members.

Now, where an independent member has a problem, the only way they can express that, is to go through the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker or the Clerk. Now that is not the best way of expressing the interest of such a member of Parliament. 

Madam Speaker, although we cannot do it now because we are just complying to the rules as it stands now, I pray that the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline will consider this because that is a command of our rules; that we must take care of all political shades in the House.

I beg to raise those two concerns. First, now that the committees have been constituted, 40 per cent of the women or more of the leadership if not, we have to reconsider.

Secondly, in future, we need to consider accommodating the Independent members. I thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, hon. Cecilia Ogwal for airing those concerns. However, for your information, in the Cabinet, the women are 55 per cent. I give you that assignment to go and crosscheck with different party whips. 

On the issue of Independents, I am surprised that it is being brought now. In the Tenth Parliament, we brought a motion but you shot it down, and it did not go through for. 

I, therefore, advise you to bring a fresh motion on Independents. I hope those who would wish to shoot it down, will not be there because any of us is capable of being an Independent. So, prepare a motion to that effect.
