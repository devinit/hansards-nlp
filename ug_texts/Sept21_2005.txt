THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Seconded.

DR KEZIMBIRA: Madam Speaker, in accordance with our rules I have with me a copy of the Certificate of Financial Implications, which I have also passed on to the Clerk. I would like to lay it on the Table. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the minister has complied with section 10 of the Budget Act. I hereby commit the Bill to the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs to handle expeditiously and report back to this House, taking into account forthcoming events.

MR AWORI: Madam Speaker, once again I would like to put a special request to Members of Cabinet to pay more attention to the procedures of Parliament. The Order Paper was circulated early this morning and honourable colleagues who sit in the Cabinet are aware that some important items will come up this afternoon. 

To my chagrin even the Leader of Government Business has not informed this August House why the two concerned ministers are not here to answer our queries. I would like to know whether we deserve an apology from the Leader of Government Business on behalf of his colleagues.

2.41
THE FIRST DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (Lt Gen. Moses Ali): Madam Speaker, I am sorry this has happened. We have just concluded a Cabinet meeting and we travelled separately. I believe the minister responsible probably went to his ministry first to collect his papers and I am expecting him anytime. Actually they have now arrived so I think we are ready to begin. Thank you. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Minister of Finance, yesterday you said your guidelines were not ready. Are they ready today?

PRESENTATION OF PAPERS

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING (Mr Isaac Musumba): Madam Speaker, I beg to lay on the Table the procedure and disposal guidelines entitled “The Public Procurement and Disposal of Assets Guidelines”. These guidelines are issued by the Public Procurement and Disposal of Assets Authority under section 91 of the Public Procurement and Disposal of Assets Act No. 1 of 2003. I beg to lay it on the Table.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The guidelines do not require any financial implications since they are embedded in the Act. Therefore, I commit them to the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic development to peruse and report back to the House.

Schedule 2

MAJ. (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: Madam Chairperson, we have amendments to Schedule 2, all of which government has agreed to, except one. 

We propose to maintain the status quo, that is, the rate of excise duty at 150 percent. 

Soft Cup: Safari, Super Match, Crescent and Star (Kali) to cost Shs 19,000 per 1,000 sticks.

Soft Cup: Sportsman, Sweet Menthol and Boss to cost Shs 25,000 per 1,000 sticks.

Hinge Lid: B & H, Embassy, Rex and Amber to cost Shs 48,000 per 1,000 sticks.

Other cigarette brands to cost Shs 48,000 per 1,000 sticks.

Others are to be maintained at 150 percent excise duty.

Smoking tobacco, whether or not containing tobacco substitutes in any proportion, is to be charged 150 percent excise duty.

“Homogenised” or “reconstituted” tobacco is to be charged 150 percent excise duty.

Others are to be charged 150 percent excise duty.

Madam Chairperson, on item six, which is airtime, the committee proposes to delete 12 percent excise duty and replace it with 10 percent. 

On item 9 –(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable chairperson, let us handle this one by one. Honourable members, you have heard the proposals to Schedule 2.

MR MUSUMBA: No objection, Madam Chairperson.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I put the question that Schedule 2(1)(b) of the Excise Tariff (Amendment) Bill, 2005 be amended as proposed by the chairperson.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: 1(c)

MAJ. (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: We have no objections to Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: But you have an amendment to 1(c)?

MAJ. (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: Yes, I have an amendment to No. 1(b).

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Do you have an amendment to 1(c)?  

MAJ. (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: Yes, Madam Chairperson. Concerning No. 1(c), we propose to amend (c) by replacing the figure Shs 27,000 with Shs 25,000.

MR MUSUMBA: No objection, Madam Chairperson.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I put the question that Schedule 2(1)(c) be amended as proposed by the chairperson.

(Question put and agreed to.)

MAJ. (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: Madam Chairperson, we have no objections to item No. 2 of the Schedule, which is on beer, neither do we object to item No. 3 -(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, just go on to your amendment.

MAJ. (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: Madam Chairperson, on item No. 6 six we propose the retention of 10 percent excise duty on air time and the justification is that this is going to encourage more usage and allow the service providers to expand their coverage. Government will also benefit from the expected increase in coverage, as this will be realised in the projected revenue from more usage.

MR MUSUMBA: Madam Chairperson, I beg to object to the chairperson’s amendment and pray that the House retains the 12 percent excise duty. As I explained yesterday, the proposed increment of excise tariff from 10 percent to 12 percent is merely a measure that is calculated to raise revenue. Furthermore, this House did appropriate money under their Appropriations Act and in the course of this a number of serious financial pressure points were brought to the attention of this House.  

For example we said that there is pressure to pay primary teachers’ salaries. As you know, these salaries have been increased from Shs 130,000 to Shs 150,000. This expenditure item alone requires Shs 13 billion. We have another pressure point, which is compensation for graduated tax. This alone requires Shs 30 billion. 

Other pressure points include elections, the Parliament and as you know Madam Chairperson, the Parliament alone requires Shs 9 billion. All these pressure points require that we find ways of financing this Budget. Airtime alone is calculated to give us Shs 34 billion. If we do anything to affect this projection at this point, the consequences will be that we must either cut down our expenditure by Shs 34 billion, which is a corresponding amount or find another tax handle to raise this money. 

I propose, therefore, that we maintain the proposed increase of airtime tariff from 10 to 12 percent. Again let me say that this is basically a calculated revenue measure and it is part and parcel of the resource envelope, which was presented and approved by this House. 

The chairperson seems to suggest that when we reduce this tax from 12 percent to 10 percent there will be increased usage of mobile phones. Let me say that the factors that influence the increase in accessibility of mobile phones goes beyond merely usage or airtime cost.  

I believe that as this sector continues to grow there will come a time when the number of people who can afford telephones and hand sets in this economy based on their incomes will reach a circulation level. Thereafter the progression or expansion of this sector will definitely drop. As we speak, in the month of August alone we have been able to meet our targets based on this new tax rate. It is, therefore, not true that we will have fewer people using airtime because this is not what is on the ground. On the contrary, Madam Chairperson, this measure will in fact help to ensure efficient utilisation of airtime so that people do not call to ask about the weather and so on. Airtime will instead be used effectively to transact business.

Having said all this, I quoted an example to this House that in the past people in the brewery sector told government that if we reduced the tax on beer we would be given more money in tax revenue. However, this did not happen. We reduced the tax but eventually had to raise it again. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that each time you reduce a tax you will definitely get an increase in that sector. The bottom line is that we have made major financial commitments relying on this important revenue handle. To affect it at this point in time is going to also affect the way we manage the Budget.  

On this basis I want to appeal to this August House to consider and reject the proposed amendment by the chairperson of the committee and allow Government to finance those budgetary pressures that are evidently in their domain. However, I wish to undertake that in the course of this year as we manage this Budget, we will re-examine this tax and have a meeting of minds in an attempt to reconcile the committee’s proposal with ours for next financial year. However, in this financial year it will not be possible. I thank you, Madam Chairperson.

MAJ. (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: Madam Chairperson, the argument advanced by the minister to the effect that this increase is going to encourage people to use their mobile phones more efficiently is actually acknowledgement that there will be less usage.

Secondly, the argument that duty reduced on an item does not necessarily encourage more usage is not true. I will quote a critical incident of the tax that was reduced by this August House on imported omnibuses with the capacity to carry 28 people and above. 

Currently because people know that these vehicles attract less tax, more are being seen on the roads. In fact on the Kampala to Jinja, Kampala to Mbale and Kampala to Kabale routes you no longer see 14-seater vehicles. It is now the 28-seaters that are abundant. Therefore, when you reduce tax on an item actually you are allowing people to use more of it. It is not true that when you reduce tax on it you inhibit usage.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, I am sorry there were some guests in the gallery but they seem to be walking out. They are from Bugabula North constituency; they were invited by hon. Kizige. They are welcome to Parliament. I know they are touring the building; so they are welcome to Parliament. 

Yesterday you had the presentations from the committee and from the minister. Today he has come with a more explicit presentation about the pressures he has. So you have had the two positions. Let us hear your views on either retaining or increasing.

MS KIRASO: Thank you, Madam Chairperson. The minister, on top of what he has just said on the Floor of this House, has circulated something small to lobby us not to reduce this excise tax from 12 to 10 because of the Shs 34 billion, which we need. This is very attractive but there are so many other issues that we have got to look at. The Shs 34 billion, is it going to arise out of the whole excise duty of 12 per cent or the difference between 10 and 12? It is very important for the members to know because if you make it look like all the Shs 34 billion is going to come from the two per cent, I think that is the misrepresentation of facts. That is one.

Number two, the honourable minister ended by saying he undertakes that in the course of the financial years we execute this budget and the Government is going to look at ways and means. It is not the first time that we oppose a tax measure and government undertakes to go and do something about it but in the spirit of not wanting to disrupt or distort the budget we always say, “Okay, go and look into it”. How many times has the Ministry of Finance come back here to say, “We looked into this and we have relaxed the tax like this?” How many times? I need you to look at that.

We are as a committee have so many times proposed ways of widening the tax base so that many people are captured into the tax bracket. The problem we have in Uganda, honourable members, is that there are so many people who are in the informal sector; they are not registered anywhere, nobody knows what they do, nobody knows how much money they earn and we are always taxing the same people year in, year out. 

Whenever we need any more money, whenever there is a budget shortfall, we go for the same people. I think there has to be a limit. Even the cow that has got that big bladder and can give you a lot of milk, there is a limit on how much you can milk it.  Time will come and that cow will stop giving you the milk.

Can we talk of the elasticity of demand on airtime?  Elasticity is the demand on airtime in elastic so that even if you raised the tax up to 20 percent people will continue coming in? The chairperson yesterday reported that the Committee on Finance met with the people who are the operators in this sector. They demonstrated to us that if they stayed at that the way they are progressing they are likely to capture more people and give more money to government.  

The other issue, which was not captured by our report, is that the financiers of the private companies were given an assurance that excise duty would not change from ten percent. On the basis of that they made an investment plan to expand the business throughout the country. Now they are saying with these tax changes what are we going to tell our financiers? Are we still going to continue expanding?  

Honourable minister, in all honesty when you are giving the example of beer you should also give the example of cigarettes. In the 2002/2003 we took a decision to increase the excise duty on cigarettes because it was a very attractive sector where consumption was higher and we were getting a lot of money. So because we could not find other ways of raising money we increased excise duty on cigarettes. You know what happened. 

That financial year the law of not smoking in public came in but people are still smoking. That year after we raised the excise duty hoping to capture more money in taxes but revenue fell so much because of so many other factors, including this excise tax. 

So, back to hon. Fred Ruhindi’s point. If we are to do what we are supposed to do, not just to rubberstamp because this money is already in the Budget, I know this money can be found if other measures to widen the tax base are taken into account by the Ministry of Finance. I beg that we stick by the committee position and keep at ten percent. I thank you.

MR BAMWANGA: Madam Chairperson, I would like to also support my colleague who is insisting that the tax rate remains at ten percent. The minister yesterday said that they were trying the tax on the export of raw hides in order to discourage collusion of exporters with tax authority. I thought that was a very big blow to members of this august House. The fact that you impose a tax on raw hides does not necessarily increase the export earning; if anything it actually reduces export earnings.  

Secondly, you could have stopped the collusion through the official systems of controls than imposing a tax. Once again my dear brother, hon. Musumba, the Minister of Finance, is telling us that increasing taxes on mobile phones is a necessary evil but more important to raise revenue. In this era of the globalisation, Madam Chairperson, with all the trade barriers imposed on poor countries of the world mobile phones had made business easy. It had been possible for business people to transact business –(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, really we had a general debate yesterday. Please, focus on the airtime and finish.

MAJ. (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: Madam Chairperson, I wish to inform the member that actually Uganda has got the highest excise tax duty on airtime in the whole of Africa.

MR BAMWANGA: Thank you very much for that information. We have been saying we want to widen the tax base. Hon. Musumba, by increasing the tax on mobile phones and telephone we are narrowing the tax base. In terms of economics there is what we call the doctrine of demand and supply. If the prices are high there will be less consumption. It is not like salt; if you reduce the taxes on salt people will not consume more salt, but now if I have to do business by using a mobile phone and you have increased the taxes you are now forcing me to drive a vehicle from Kampala city to Muyenga, which may actually be more inconvenient and costly for the business community.  

So, I want to support my colleagues that already the consumers are victims of the beepers especially those from our constituencies. They have been beeping you all the time now they are going to increase the cost of your communication with the constituencies. I think it is not fair that we should increase this tax from 10 per cent to 12 percent. I thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, let me appeal to you not to say Mr Musumba is against the public.  It is the Ministry of Finance and the Government, which have brought these proposals, not the person called Isaac Musumba. So just say Minister of Finance.

COL BUTIME: Thank you, Madam Chairperson. Precisely, it is not a debate between hon. Musumba and people who have handsets and Members of Parliament. It is an issue of the Ministry of Finance, Parliament and the Government for that matter. So it is not personal to hon. Musumba. 

Yesterday the minister conceded when we talked about the sanitary pads. He said, “I concede, but tomorrow please pay in kind” and we kind of agreed. So really that is gentleman’s agreement and I think we should support him in his quest for this 12 percent. If you pay the primary teachers, you pay secondary teachers and you spend money on police security, you are actually expanding usage of airtime because the OC station in a remote police station will now have capacity to access a handset and be able to communicate for purposes of security.  

So, the chairman may not be right to say that it does not help that if you keep it at 10 percent or even less as more people will access it. Even if you went to 12 percent but as long as you pay a primary teacher and a secondary teacher, and they are very many in this country, they can also be users in this bracket. So really I think we should appreciate this. I strongly support that we should move from 10 percent to 12 percent. I thank you, Madam Chairperson.

MR NYOMBI THEMBO: Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. I also stand to support the minister.  I would like to make some observations. Let us go down to the basics of economic theory and revenue maximization vis-à-vis this particular product and utilize the basic concept of the product development cycle. Everybody knows that the mobile telephone is a new product on the market from the economic perspective. As all of us know this product is still on what we call the gross stage. Usually products pass through three stages – some information so that I can drop my point – the growth stage, stagnation and decline stage.  

Usually all policy makers must make sure that during the growth stage this is when producers want to maximize profits as much as they want. This is when government should take the opportunity to maximize revenue. If you have budget pressures you should not wait for the stagnation or decline stage. Everybody knows that for mobile telephones in this country this is the opportune moment when it is in the growth stage. This is when we should maximize revenue as much as we can much as the producers are also trying to maximize profits as much as they can.  

My sister, the hon. Member of Parliament and Chairperson of the Budget Committee, brought the issue of the cigarettes. We have not come out with the evidence on the issue of elasticity. The minister has come out with evidence that in the last month actually increasing excise duty did not affect the consumption of this particular service.  That is evidence as far as elasticity of demand is concerned. On the contrary the cigarettes, which the Chairperson of the Budget Committee is mentioning, we should know that we have evidence in this market that there are behavioural changes in as far as smoking is concerned in this country. There is undisputable evidence, the anti-smoking laws, smuggling activities, all those have affected cigarette consumption not elasticity of demand.  

So, I want to implore the Members of Parliament that given the budgetary pressures we have got as they have been well articulated by the minister and given the stage at which this product is, the growth stage, this is where we should maximize revenue. Let us accept the good thing the minister has committed government that we shall review in the middle of the on-goings to see what we can do. So I request Members of Parliament that given the pressures let us leave the excise duty at 12 percent so that we can maintain our budgetary balance. Thank you very much.

MR AWORI: Thank you, Madam Chairperson. Once again, like yesterday, I rise to support the tax. For once this is a tax, which one would categorise as a consumer tax. I would like to differ with my honourable colleague the Chairperson of the Budget Committee when she says we have been taxing the same people year in, year out. This one is almost like a consumer tax, which is non-discriminatory. When you use your mobile, you pay. There is no question of saying you pay or you do not pay. For so long as you want to use your mobile you are going to pay.  

Once again I say this is not a luxury tax, which should not be put in the same category as punitive or targeted at certain people. Even if that were the case, it is only those who can afford Shs 150,000 to invest in communication equipment called a mobile phone that can afford it. Therefore, I would support the idea of generating more revenue for the state as long as the state does not abuse the revenue that we are generating from various sources.  

This question of generating revenue, my honourable colleague here, the Minister in charge of ICT, as we categorized him yesterday, I do not know what percentage of this revenue is going into strengthening of regulatory organizations. Definitely, we need a stronger regulatory setup in the communications system. 

Take for instance when we are talking about revenue generation in terms of taxation; we seem to be talking about sympathy for the so-called investor. The investor is realizing higher returns on their investment than is apparent in their tax returns. If they were to change the system of charging the consumer from the current unity to seconds, the consumer would also share in the industry. At the moment the entire profit is going to the investor. When you make a call of one second or just beeping, they charge you as if you have made a call for one minute, why? (Applause)  

Let us talk to the industry and tell them that they must change their system of charging the consumers. Instead of going per second, they are switched to per unit, which is one minute or one second. But as it is, now they are realizing higher returns on their investment, so the Government has got every right to get some money out of this huge profit and plough it into other sectors. (Applause)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Please, wind up.

MR AWORI: Madam Speaker, as I said, this is a very rare occasion. I agree with my honourable colleagues on the front bench and I do not want to put in conditions. In the same breath I would like to take this opportunity to call upon the Government that this matter of duopolies whereby we are limited to two or three operators is not food. 

Why is it that in other industries it is open field, but when it comes to this one, we restrict them? We say, “No, only three at a time?” One time it was only two until the other day when we opened up a little bit. So we should open it up and declare openly that this is a free field. Let us go for open competition. 

May I call upon the honourable colleagues in the Cabinet that when we give you this tax you ensure that that money is put to good use? We want to see our Policemen properly paid. May I also take this opportunity, Madam Chairperson with your permission, to tell my honourable colleagues in charge of Finance and Internal Affairs that you have been cheating the policemen on their food money for the months of June and July and even August, you have not been paying them and this is not fair?

Secondly, you have been restricting them on their payments that they can only get their money from certain banks. Stanbic for instance takes seven days before these poor people can get their money. 

MS KIRASO: Thank you hon. Awori for giving way. I wanted to help you so that you do not spoil your otherwise good point having contributed on supporting that tax. The money, which we are talking about has already been incorporated in the budget, it is part of the draft expenditure that we approved the other week before we went on recess. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Hon. Awori, please wind up.

MR AWORI: On that note, I would like to wind up. Indeed we have already committed this money. How do we take it out again?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Now are there members with contrary views? Please, be brief.

MR GAGAWALA: Yes, I will be brief. There is a Kisoga proverb which says that if a worker comes to work and you give him a one kilogram hoe and he says that a one kilogram hoe cannot do the work and he wants one, which is heavier or lighter, you allow him to take the hoe he wants to use. 

In this instance we have no choice. We must allow the minister to do as he wants because what we want is revenue and the chairman has tried to show him an easier way but the minister is resistant. Moreover, the minister has come up with his needs list; it will be foolish of us not to comply with what he is pleading for in view of that fact. He is clear that the economy is –(Interruption)

MR KAKOOZA: I would like to inform my honourable colleague that as much as the Cabinet brings the tax laws, they should be also debated first because they have some disadvantages. The moment you want to institute a tax, which cannot yield a turnover in your budget, you stand to lose. So, it is not a must that when you bring a law and we accept it all is well. It has got its disadvantages. 

For instance, moving from 17 to 18 percent, how many people do you expect to pay and how will it affect your budget? You might not get the target you want. So I find it very convenient that you might bring it and we discuss it and give an input. 

MR GAGAWALA: Yes, I thank you for your information but the issue is that the person we assigned the work of looking after the ministry is the minister and he is presenting his views that he can only deliver in terms of creating revenue if we give him this tool and that is the tool he is requesting for. 

If we give contrary views and our chairman does not get details with our facts to take the opposite, then we should leave the minister to go and attempt his luck. If he does not then he will be hanging himself here on this floor. So I persuade my friends that the correct way would be to allow the minister to have his way so that we can proceed with some other business. Thank you, Madam Chairperson.

MR OCHIENG: Thank you, Madam Chairperson. I am basically seeking guidance. There are about two areas here –(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: On airtime?

MR OCHIENG: On airtime, 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Specifically on either 10 or 12, please.

MR OCHIENG: Yes, Madam Chairperson, it is as if we have already started paying this money so I am wondering what happens if we halt it now. Are we going to be given back this money? If so, how is it going to work?  

Secondly, if we are not going to do otherwise, why disturb ourselves after such a long period of time has already gone?  

Thirdly, Madam Chairperson, the argument that I am hearing is that these people will not have the money and they want to roll out. I have been informed by the chairman and his colleague that the roll out plan, which was in the agreement, was supposed to have ended in July this year. They were supposed to have reached all sub-counties. I, therefore, find the argument a little strange and that is why I need guidance over these two matters. Thank you.

DR OKULO EPAK: Thank you, Madam Chairperson. I think this is a fait accompli. Let us have the tax; let those who cannot afford the airtime close up their mobile phones in boxes. 

However, I think we can capture the advantage of this tax not merely by increasing the revenue from mobile phones and not merely by increasing the tax rate but we should also expand the service so that people have access to networks and will be encouraged to buy telephones. Some will even sell their cows in order to buy telephones. 

Like my minister there, let us expand and get more people using this service and in the way you will get more money than simply restricting the service and then wanting to get more money by increasing the taxes. We have a dual possibility of capturing this facility to bring revenue to government and since we are not investing in the infrastructure, why not just come out with a policy, a very tight policy to force these people to expand? Thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Okay honourable members, we had a long debate on this matter and it occupied a lot of time yesterday. It has also been spoken for and against today. So I now put the question. The chairman had – you want to say something?

MR MUSUMBA: Madam Chairperson, for the avoidance of doubt, I request that you state even the numbers like those in favour of retaining the 12 percent say aye, so that we know exactly what we are voting on.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, now the question is, the minister has proposed an additional tax of two percent, making it 12 percent. The chairman and his committee were of a different view, that it should remain static. So we are now going to vote. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Is there another amendment?

MAJ. (RTD) RWAMIRAMA:  Madam Chairperson, in item No. 9 replace that item with the following: “Imported sacks and bags of polythene papers, or ethylene and other plastics falling under Tariff Heading 3923.21.00 and 3923.29.00 of the East African Customs Union, Common External Tariff.” 

The justification, as earlier mentioned, there is no alternative yet we also noted that such items are coming from our neighbouring region and competing with the highly taxed locally manufactured iteMs This is going to increase cost and affect the industrial development and employment here in Uganda. It is our position in our recommendation last year and we are in agreement with the Ministry.

MR MUSUMBA: We are in agreement, Madam Chairperson.

MAJ. (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: Madam Chairperson, I beg to move the following proposed amendments to clause 4:

Amend clause 4(c) by deleting sub-clause (y). Justification: this is to make the items: Mobilet Toilets, Ekoolo Toilets, herein zero-rated and not exempted because the status quo would imply that the raw materials for these items would be liable to VAT hence increasing their prices.

Two, insert (i) to read as follows –(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Let us move one by one. Mr Minister? 

MR MUSUMBA: No objection, Madam Chair.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Okay, I put the question that clause 4 sub-clause (c) be amended as proposed by the chairperson.
(Question put and agreed to.)

MAJ. (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: The second proposed amendment to clause 4 is for a new clause 56. Insert (i) to read as follows: “The supply and installation of Mobile Toilets, Ekoolo Toilets and components made from this polythene.”

Justification: to improve on the need for sanitation requirements in very needy places particularly in the IDP camps. These items need to be promoted to meet the challenges of human disposal in cases of emergency and temporary functions. They are environmentally friendly.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I put the question that clause – yes, Mr Minister, what do you say about it?

MR MUSUMBA: No objection, Madam Chair.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I put the question that the new clause 56 be inserted as proposed by the chairperson.

(Question put and agreed to.)

MAJ. (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: Madam Chair, following our debate yesterday, it was also agreed that the sanitary towels be VAT zero-rated. (Applause) I move that they be zero-rated and I have consulted with the hon. Minister of Finance and we are in agreement. I beg to move.

MRS BWAMBALE: Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to thank the chairperson and the minister for having discussed comprehensively and having agreed on this, which was raised yesterday by all of us in the House. 

I would like to have a further amendment that it is not only the sanitary towels but it goes together with the pampers, as it is in the whole of East Africa. Pampers are the gadgets that are wrapped around babies to prevent them from having infections from uric acid or the urine. I beg to have that the amendment be inserted. It is in harmony with the amendment we have and in Kenya and Tanzania it is the same. Thank you. I beg to move.

MR MUSUMBA: Madam Chair, sometime this year when you were presiding over a world population day function in Kamuli for which I was the host Minister, we were talking about population and gender issues when the women in that place complained to you and I said that tax on sanitary pads was a problem and that we should remove tax on them. You quickly summoned me and asked whether it is true that there was a tax on these items and I said, “Yes Madam, there is some form of tax, not too much but some form of tax” and you said, “No, this must not be” and you undertook before those people who were assembled there that you were going to ensure that this tax is removed in this budget. 

As luck would have it - I was actually praying that you would not be the one here - but as luck would have it, you are the one here. Therefore, I have no choice but to respect the undertaking I made on behalf of Government. 

Therefore, Madam Chairperson, on the issue of sanitary towels –(Interruption)

MS ALASO: Madam Chairperson, I have been listening to the minister very attentively and actually yesterday he sounded convinced, but now he is telling us he has been making a very negative prayer about this very serious subject. Is the honourable minister in order to pray very negatively about such an important issue?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, yesterday the Minister was quite excited and completely convinced. So, he is out of order to pretend otherwise this afternoon.  

MR MUSUMBA: Thank you, Madam Chairperson. All I was doing is giving an additional background to this matter. However, I have no objection to the amendment. The ladies agreed that they would support me today on the airtime and they have supported me. So, I am very happy.

Madam Chairperson, on the issue of additional staff, yesterday we discussed and I agreed that I would consider the sanitary towels but there was additional discussion on knickers and pampers, which was not conclusively discussed in this House.  I therefore, pray to this House to allow us –(Interruption)

MRS BWAMBALE: Thank you, Madam Chairperson. I want to remind the honourable minister that yesterday the debate on knickers was discarded, the knickers were not absolutely essential, but the sanitary towels and the pampers were discussed together and even we defined it –(Interruption)

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Madam Chairperson, yesterday we discussed sanitary towels actually, which appears on our HAC Code together with tampons 48.18.40.10 and 5601.10.00 respectively. We never discussed what the honourable member is bringing now. Is it in order for her to impute that actually we discussed them conclusively when you were at the same time chairing this House?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, yesterday hon. Loyce Bwambale brought that matter of both sanitary towels and pampers but the thrust of the discussion was on the sanitary towels, which were considered vital for retention of children in schools. I think that was the basis for the support for that item. Actually, we did not venture into pampers. We focused mainly on the sanitary towels for the reasons which you already know.

MRS BWAMBALE: Madam Chairperson, yesterday the principle idea in the discussion was an affirmative action policy being implemented and you cannot separate women and girls from children. Pampers are as important as the sanitary towels and I am very sure about the motion I raised yesterday. I went home convinced that the principle was covering both. So, I would like to appeal to the chairperson and the minister –(Interruption)

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Madam Chairperson, decisions made here are economic decisions and I get defeated personally when the Government tries to raise revenue to finance its programmes including social services. If we want Government to do everything, it means we are actually going to overburden the formal sector with heavy taxes.  

Whereas it was appreciated yesterday that actually the sanitary towels are necessary, if you bring in the element of providing for children and you are not providing for a limited number of children, if you are going to produce thousands and thousands of children so that Government can provide for them –(Interruption)

MS SARAH NAMUSOKE: Madam Chairperson, is the honourable member in order to give this House and the nation the impression that people produce children just anyhow? Is he even in order to suggest that we can just go out to produce simply because the tax has been reduced?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: No, he is not. But honourable members, on a very serious note, we had a lengthy debate on this matter. I was in the Chair and the thrust of it was supporting girl-child education by removing this tax. 

MR JAMES KAKOOZA: I would like hon. Loyce Bwambale to clarify and tell us because there are some pampers, which are disposable and those that are not. And with the same spirit of exempting the sanitary pads, then pampers, which go for the same purpose qualify too. But the problem is the classification because there are some, which are multi-purpose, and there are some which are not.

DR STEVEN MALLINGA: Madam Chairperson, I think there is confusion. We know what sanitary towels and tampons are. Pampers for children are made of disposable paper and they cater for middle class women who can afford them. Diapers are what everybody uses. So, I do not really see the relevance of pampers here. They are not relevant.

MS NAMUSOKE: Madam Chairperson, I listened to the amendment of the honourable chairperson. He talked about sanitary towels but in his list of the things that were discussed, he mentioned tampons. Now, I am concerned that in the amendment, we might exclude tampons simply because they were not discussed. So, I just want clarification from him whether they are also in the list of items to be exempted because I think just like sanitary towels, tampons are very important as far as girl children are concerned. Thank you.

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Madam Chairperson, when I was making a clarification, I handled both, and both of them are on the HAC Code that I mentioned. So, we are considering both of them respectively. I think for Hansard purposes, it is sanitary towels and tampons.

MR MUSUMBA: Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson.  I have no objection to the amendment of the chairperson regarding sanitary towels and tampons.  Thank you. (Applause) (Mrs Bwambale rose_)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Okay, are you still insisting on pampers?

MRS BWAMBALE: Madam, I have moved and I have not withdrawn. I would like to request that you put it to a vote.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Hon. Bwambale has moved an amendment that in addition to the agreed areas of yesterday, namely the sanitary towels and tampons, we add pampers. 

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Madam Chair, the committee was considering this Bill and the mover of this amendment did not appear in our committee. We only allowed it yesterday because of the commitment by the minister and the fact that the committee had actually in the previous year waived off other taxes because of the same consideration. Is it procedurally right for a member to come and ambush us in the House and possibly distort the revenue projections for which budget we have passed?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I think if you had wanted us to shut out that matter you would not have allowed it in the first place. But we have discussed it. So, let us take a vote on it.

MR MUTULUUZA: According to this item, which the honourable member has brought, is there any projection of any revenue within the budget that we have completed? If it is not there, we cannot pass a law, which is very discriminative. If he says sanitary towels are exempted, and they serve the same purpose as pampers, then you cannot say -(Interjections) If they do not serve the same purpose -(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, let us take a vote. The question is that, in addition to the sanitary towels and tampons, hon. Bwambale is proposing that pampers also be exonerated. I put the question.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Title settled.

PRESENTATION, CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE, ON UNRESOLVED DIFFERENCE OF SHS 108 BILLION DEBITED ON UGANDA CONSOLIDATED FUND.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Chairperson, Public Accounts Committee.

4.05
THE CHAIRPERSON, PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE (Dr Okulo Epak): Madam Speaker, before I present the report, I would like to remind the House that sometime back, the House adopted the report of the Public Accounts Committee on Auditor-General’s report on the account of government ending 30th June 1999 with the condition that the request for writing off shs 108 billion, which was unreconciled should be looked into afresh. The committee was instructed to get this work done and hence this report.

Background:

In his report to Parliament for the year that ended on 30th June 1999, the Auditor-General reported an unreconciled amount of shs 108, 542,962,336 on the Uganda Consolidated Fund Accounts, citing difficulties in tracing the supporting documentation to these transactions due to weaknesses in the government accounting and internal control that had existed over a long time.  

During discussions with the Accounting Officer, he requested the committee to have the resolved difference written off to ensure that Treasury book records reflect the actual position of funds available in Bank of Uganda. The committee was further told that this difference had been cumulative and had been forwarded for a long period and there was no hope in resolving it.  

Basing on these facts, the Public Accounts Committee recommended to the House to write off this difference after being assured by the Treasury that this was the only available alternative.  

During the debate on the report of the committee, the House raised concerns and rejected this recommendation basing on the fact that the reasons given for write off were not substantive enough and directed for further investigations on the matter.  The matter was referred back to the committee.

Issues and Terms of Reference:

The committee embarked on the investigations with the following objectives:

·	To have the reconciliation statement presented by the Accountant-General and verified by the Auditor-General to explain the difference.
·	Establish the cause of the unexplained difference of shs 108 billion.
·	To establish whether payments made out of the consolidated funds for the period 1991 to 1999 were properly authorized and supported by audit warrants.  
·	To establish whether this difference was actually cumulative and therefore give a break down of the accumulation.

The Approach:

The committee held meetings with the Auditor-General, Governor Bank of Uganda and the Accountant-General on the matter.

Arising out of these meetings, the committee directed the Secretary to the Treasury to reconstruct the cashbook of the Consolidated Fund and avail to the Auditor-General the Consolidated Fund reconstructed cashbooks, Bank Statements for the period 1991/1992 to 1998/1999, checked for their completeness and accuracy.  

The committee also asked the Auditor-General to verify payments from the Consolidated Fund to ascertain if they were supported by Audit Warrants. The committee during this exercise incorporated support of interested Members of Parliament on the matter.  

Auditor-General’s Findings and Recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee.

The Auditor-General reported differences he found between the Treasury Consolidated Fund cashbook and Bank Statements as follows:

Differences between Treasury and Bank of Uganda Records

 The audit report noted that the major cause of the differences was failure by the Treasury to periodically reconcile its Uganda Consolidated Fund records with the Bank of Uganda. The first reconciliation of the Consolidated Fund Account was carried out in 1998/1999.

Charges on the Consolidated Fund Account

On further examination of the Treasury Records and Bank Statements, the unreconciled differences representing debits on the Consolidated Fund Account that had not been recorded in the Treasury Records and which were previously reflected as being shs 108,542,962,336 were readjusted to the tune of shs 441,999,195,643. In other words, the matter was much more than what we had been made to believe.

The previous unreconciled amount of shs 180 billion was, therefore, subsumed into the shs 442 billion reflected as follows:
Unpaid Revenue Cheques -	Shs 1,147,103,078
Promissory notes/Treasury Bill-Shs 4,189,807,599
Reversals	- 	Shs 39,614,806,251
External Debt Payment-	Shs 358,423,590,348
Interest Charges	-	Shs 15,000,000,000
Bank Charges	-	Shs 92,600
Letter of Credit	-	Shs 3,248,526,126
Releases                 	- 	Shs 20,375,269,642
Thus, providing a total of Shs 441,999,195,643

The details of these transactions were as follows:

Unpaid Revenue Cheques amounting to shs 1,147,103,078 reported to have been banked by Treasury and credited to the Consolidated Fund were on being dishonoured, debited on the Uganda Consolidated Fund Account.

Corresponding entries had not been passed to the Treasury records. The Treasury cashbooks have now been updated to reflect this:

Cheques amounting to shs 144,752,227 were made good by Treasury itself. However, the Auditor-General reported that he had not been provided with evidence that the remaining cheques amounting to shs 530,851 were replaced. Treasury had promised to provide this evidence but later reported back to the committee that they had failed to trace the cheque in question.  

A promissory note of shs 4,189,041,095 and mature Treasury bills of shs 766,504 that were also wrongly paid out of the Consolidated Fund in 1992/1993 and 1994/1995 respectively, had also been omitted in the cashbook. Although the transactions are now reflected in the reconstructed cashbook, they appeared not to have been authorized by the Auditor-General. 

The explanation given was that both Bank of Uganda and Treasury thought that since this was Statutory Revenue, there was no need for Audit Warrant. The opinion of the Solicitor-General was sought who ruled that the warrant would still be required. The dilemma now is as to whether the retrospective warrant could be issued after several years. This however, has remained in the Consolidated Fund as a debit but with no warrant.

On the Treasury bills, Bank of Uganda accepted to reverse shs 766,504, an entry that was a misposting and therefore no longer relevant. The committee recommends the House to take a decision on this matter.  

Reversals

These comprise several debits on the consolidated fund of shs 39,614,806,251 that were made as reversals of entries that had been erroneously created on the Uganda consolidated fund account.  The Auditor General reported to the committee that supporting documents explaining the reversals had been provided to him. He verified and found them satisfactory. He further confirmed that the whole amount of shs 39,614,806,251 had been reflected in the reconstructed cashbook. The Public Accounts Committee noted that the money was wrongly debited. It, however, accepted the confirmation of the Auditor General that the error had been rectified in the reconstructed cashbook.

External debt payment

External debt payment of shs 358,423,090,347 had been charged on the Uganda consolidated fund without corresponding entries being made in the Treasury cashbook.  These payments were made during the financial years 1992/1993, 1994/1995, 1996/1997 and 1997/1998.  Although these payments are chargeable on the Uganda consolidated fund, a detailed audit warrant test carried out on the payments relating to a selected sample of financial years 1992/1993, 1993/1994 and 1995/1996 showed that the payments of shs 358,358,097,293 were supported with audit warrants contrary to the earlier report that the payments lacked these documents. 

The Auditor also confirmed that the difference of shs 65,492,654 arose from the differences in the exchange rates used by the Treasury and Bank of Uganda.  The committee accepted the confirmation made by the Auditor General.

Interest Rates

Quarterly interest rates of shs 1.5 billion totalling to shs 12 billion were paid out of the Uganda consolidated fund in the 1996/1997 and 1997/1998 financial years against a treasury note issued for impaired capitalisation of the Bank of Uganda.  An additional interest on Treasury bill of shs 3 billion had also been made on the account.  These payments were chargeable on the Uganda consolidated fund, but had not been entered in the Treasury cashbook.  Documents supporting the expenditure had been provided, verified and found satisfactory by the Auditor General.  The Treasury also passed corresponding entries in the reconstructed cashbook. 

The Committee asked the Auditor General to confirm with the Solicitor General as to whether this charge was not a violation of the law, and further to find out whether the charge was included in the budget for that Financial Year and thereby authorized by Parliament. 

In his opinion to the committee, the Solicitor General advised that the securities in question indeed constituted a debt owed by the Government of Uganda to Bank of Uganda.  He advised that in terms of Article 160 of the Constitution, such a debt is a public debt and therefore chargeable upon the consolidated fund, and as such expenditure related thereto is statutory expenditure because it is charged on the consolidated fund by the Constitution.  

The fore going being the case, redemption of the securities and payment of interest thereon does not have to be approved by Parliament.

Bank Charges

Bank charges on the Uganda consolidated fund totalling shs 92,600, which were chargeable on the consolidated fund had not been reflected in the Treasury cashbook.  The Auditor General confirmed that it had then been charged on the consolidated fund and corresponding entries have been made in the Treasury records to recognise them.

Letter of Credit

A letter of credit of shs 3,248,526,126 paid by Treasury in 1994/1995 to purchase railway wagons for Government had been erroneously omitted in the Treasury records.  Supporting documents to authenticate this transaction was provided, verified and found to be a proper charge on the Uganda consolidated fund.  The Treasury in its cashbooks has also passed corresponding entries. 
The committee accepted this position.  

Releases

Releases of funds of shs 20,375,269,642 charged on the consolidated fund of which shs 10,086,239,000 was to ministries and shs 10,289,030,642 to statutory account 308 had not been recorded in Treasury records. The amounts have now been charged on the consolidated fund and the Auditor General confirmed authorising all these payments. 

The committee accepted the Auditor General’s confirmation.

Receipts into the consolidated fund

The Auditor General reported that he used Treasury documents relating to receipts into the consolidated fund and verified them against the entries made in the cashbook and bank records.  He also made tests on transfers from Uganda Revenue Authority collection accounts and a number of budget support accounts to the Uganda consolidated fund.  The Auditor General confirmed that from the samples selected, the results indicated that there were no significant differences between the receipts reported by the Treasury and Bank of Uganda.

Conclusion

The Public Accounts Committee has done all within its means to get the matter of unresolved debits on the consolidated fund answered by both Treasury and Bank of Uganda.  Both the Secretary to the Treasury and Governor, Bank of Uganda were put to task to give explanations.  It is the view of the Public Accounts Committee that the matter now be put to rest.  The committee notes that this arose mainly as a result of having poor systems in place resulting into poor record keeping. 

The committee, however, now reports that the Accountant General has taken steps to address these weaknesses in Government bookkeeping and internal control system that caused the differences. The steps taken include; computerisation of the cashbook and reconciliation process, improving the filing system, strengthening internal audit, putting in place appropriate staffing policies; and the committee was also informed of a Memorandum of understanding between Bank of Uganda and Treasury to harmonise the rules of both parties.

The committee is confident that the Public Finance and Accountability Act in the accompanying regulations will address this problem. The committee however, strongly warns Treasury on this matter and directs for improvement in the management of the consolidated fund account. I beg to move.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much, for this wonderful report. I also thank you for redirecting the management for Public finances.  Honourable members, the report is signed by six out of 15 members. We can now debate. However, in view of the recommendations, I do not know if you will have much to say. 

4.21
MR DANIEL KIWALABYE MUSOKE (Kiboga County East, Kiboga): Madam Speaker, I thank the committee for undertaking a matter, which appeared to have reached a dead end. It was the wisdom of this Parliament that enabled the matter to be revisited. We are happy that the committee has investigated and found out how much of our money can be accounted for. 

Madam Speaker, while I support the recommendation that the matter be put to rest, I would like to seek clarification on page 5. The committee says, “The explanation given was that both Bank of Uganda and Treasury thought that since this was statutory revenue, there was no need for audit warrant.” Is it revenue or expenditure? I would think it is expenditure for it is only expenditure, which requires a warrant, and not revenue. 

I do not know what the law says about this. Maybe the Solicitor General should have guided on this matter. The question standing is; “Should retrospective warrants be allowed?” If the law allows it, then they should be written to rectify the matter. However, if it does not, I would recommend that the matter be put to rest.  The expenditure that was made was bad. It only lacked proper procedures. I thank you.

4.30
DR FRANCIS EPETAIT (Ngora County, Kumi): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I applaud the judicious manner in which the Committee on Public Accounts has handled this matter. I also thank the entire House for the wise decision that we took to refer the question of the shs 180 billion, which was recommended for a write off for further investigations. That was a very wise decision, because now we know the details of what exactly happened. 

My observation is that there has been some degree of laxity on the part of the Treasury. Omissions were made in their cashbooks on various occasions, on promissory notes, on external debts, on letters of credit, on releases and many others. They seem to have been transacting without keeping good appropriate records.  I call this negligence of duty. The negligent staff that led us into wasting our valuable time in such investigations should be punished. 

I appreciate the recommendations made and the checks that have been put in place, to streamline the system.  However, recommendations do not guarantee that all will be okay now. There has to be some tough action on staff that are not doing their job professionally. On the expenditure on the promissory notes and treasury bills, the committee says there is a dilemma and this House needs to take a decision.  

If it is not harmful, for once I recommend that since the Solicitor General says the audit warrant ought to have been issued, we can still go ahead and recommend a retrospective warrant for that expenditure.  However, I hope it will not set a very bad precedent. This may encourage laxity on the other side. In order to put the matter to rest for this particular case, I suggest that we take this as a special case.  We could recommend that a retrospective warrant be given be given for that expenditure.  

Madam Speaker, the committee should have told us. The figures on page 4 add up to almost shs 442 billion, yet the Auditor General’s report previously talked of only shs 108 billion, which they wanted us to write off.  Therefore, I hope the Auditor General will go further that extra mile before he recommends anything to that effect. Thank you.

MR ARIMPA KIGYAGI (Mbarara Municipality, Mbarara): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.  I think all the issues raised by this House have been put to rest, except the promissory notes and Treasury.  However, we have achieved several things. The internal systems of Bank of Uganda and Treasury have been strengthened, to ensure that this does not occur again. 

The Auditor General and the Solicitor General have given advice where it is due and put most of the issues to rest.  My recommendation is that we take a decision and finish with this matter.  I do not think that the issuing of a retrospective warrant would make a difference.  We are now sure that this money was not lost erroneously. I do not see any other query that should come out after this. I thank you.

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING (Mr Isaac Musumba):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I thank the PAC committee for their thorough investigation. I undertake to consider the recommendations you made.  We have already started the reforms, and indeed, we have now finished installing the integrated financial management system, which is computerised. This links revenue to expenditure and is accessed by Uganda Revenue Authority, Bank of Uganda, Treasury, the Auditor General and all the benefiting ministries and departments. We are confident that the kind of book keeping mistakes that happened until 2002/03 will not re-occur.

THE CHAIRPERSON, PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE (Dr Okulo Epak): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I thank the committee and the whole House for standing firm on this matter.  It is regrettable that at that time, the committee was almost taken for a ride believing that nothing else could be done.  The study was done by a credible audit firm, which had made similar recommendations. However, when we went back under duress, we managed to get more details of the matter.  Therefore, I suggest that in future, whenever Parliament feels dissatisfied, they should always take a strong stand. I thank the House for this. I am sure the whole committee was very happy about this.

Hon. Kiwalabye, warrants on the promissory notes and treasury bills is a Government commitment to people who invested in the treasury bills.  It becomes expenditure in a sense that when it matures, they must be paid. Therefore, the question was whether in the processing and making of that payment, one should require an audit warrant. That is why we sought the Solicitor General’s opinion.  This is statutory revenue because Government got revenue from investors, and it is expenditure because Government is paying back to the previous investors. The most important thing is that when they mature, you pay automatically and there is no more need for an audit warrant.  

The retrospective warrant is a situation where there was an assumption that there was no need for a warrant. Everybody believed there would be no need for a warrant until the Auditor General said there was need and yet, they had not been issued.  Therefore, the question is, should we issue a retrospective warrant?  Once again, I think we brought this to the House to express our opinion.  My strong view is that retrospective warrants for 1992/93, 1994/95 is unnecessary indulgence.  All these factors have been identified –(Interruption)

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA:  Madam Speaker, the principle of retrospective is to bring those who are accountable to do what they did not do.  It may not cure anything, but the fact that they get involved in that exercise is to be on record that they did not do it.

MR MUTULUUZA:  Madam Speaker, I am a member of the Public Accounts Committee. I seek clarification from the chairperson of our committee.
  
THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON:  Hon. Mutuluuza, are you not a member of this committee?
 
MR MUTULUUZA:  Madam Speaker, my concern is that the member who raised the issue is not in this House. In the process of trying to find out how this money came about, he gave us a lot of headache and now he is not here.  He might come after this House has pronounced itself on this issue and raise the same problem.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Hon. Mutuluuza, when a member raises a matter here and the House adopts it, it is property of the whole House. He or she will not be allowed to raise it again.  We put it on the Order Paper and we are debating it.  If they are not here that is their problem.  They will not be allowed to raise it again.

MR FREDDIE RUHINDI (Nakawa Division, Kampala):  Madam Speaker, I want to go by the explanation the chairperson made. The worry, which was made by hon. Kiwalabye, is fundamental.  By saying, “Look! What does the law say? Does this House have the capacity to make a decision which is retrospective, which may not be sustained within the enabling legislation; what does the legislation say?”

In my opinion, to avoid all that is to go with recommendations of the committee because what they have found out are irregularities, which are not fundamental, we have not actually seen anything talked about in terms of embezzlement or in terms of what these irregularities created by our systems of work.  

The recommendation is: Let us put our system of work in place and everything will fall in place.

DR EPETAIT: I just want to possibly inform my colleague.  The committee sought the opinion of the Solicitor General and I am sure the Solicitor General must have looked into the provisions of the law regarding the need for a warrant and, in his opinion, a warrant would still be required.  So, I think that is what is in the law.

DR OKULO:  Madam Chairperson, the argument was: Would this sort of payment require an audit warrant and the opinion of the Solicitor General was that it should have been transacted on the basis of a warrant at that time. 

So, we are now sure that there was what you may call a misunderstanding or a recklessness on the part of the people who are dealing with this matter but they also genuinely assume that it would not require a warrant.  So, the Solicitor General did not say, “you must still give a retrospective warrant”, he did not say so.  

As to whether - I do not know whom we are punishing, you see the period is that we do not even know the people who made these mistakes.  Even, the Auditor General who was there at that time is not the one now and I do know the purpose - really we are always subject to the decision of the House.

I do not know the purpose of giving a retrospective; we are all satisfied that these transactions were in order except for that lack of a procedure matter.  It is a procedural matter that a procedure was not adhered to but the transactions were eligible.  It is a disciplinary matter. Even if we wanted to pass an opinion that those people should be disciplined, I do not even know whether they are still there, but since it is a simple disciplinary matter, not a criminal matter, you cannot pursue them wherever they are.  

So, I think really the most important thing is, this has been a great effort in forcing the Treasury first of all – you know it is not a simple thing to reconstruct a cashbook from 1992 and for the Bank of Uganda to go back to all the archives and dig up all this information and bring them to the Auditor General to prove. 

I think at that time the concern was that there was some misappropriation involved which has now been cleared and I would want to prevail upon the honourable House not to –any gaps, yes, the only gap which are there, are payment cheques which were dishonoured and the company or the individuals can longer be located. 

I think we can write it off, we can forget it, that is the only gap in putting all the figures together.  Otherwise, I think that is where we would put the question to rest, there was no misdeed, they were only careless and I think at that time the staff in the Treasury were very weak.  The accounting officers were not qualified accountants and they were over-relaxed.  

So, there was no regular reconciliation between the Treasury and Bank of Uganda regarding the operations of the Consolidated Fund.  I think this is now being corrected and we could be satisfied with that commitment on the part of the Treasury that they have learnt a lesson and they will not have it repeated.  I thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you honourable members.  Again on behalf of the Plenary, let me thank our committee for carrying out the oversight role so seriously and helping the Treasury to organise itself.  

So, I now put the question that the report of the committee of the Public Accounts Committee be adopted.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Now, honourable members, there is a small procedural matter. Hon. Joseph Balikuddembe Mutebi joined this House recently and wishes to join the committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs where I have been assured that there is a vacancy. So, it requires the House to approve that he goes to work on that committee for the duration of his stay here.  

So, I put the question that hon. Balikuddembe be permitted to join the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs committee for the duration of his stay here.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay, honourable members -(Interruption)

MS KIRASO: I would also like to announce a vacancy on the Budget Committee created by the departure of hon. Winnie Byanyima in case somebody is interested.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, if you are still interested in switching from your present standing committees, there is a vacancy on the Standing Committee on the Budget and which you know is a very active committee.  

So, honourable members, I want to thank you for the work transacted today.  

Honourable chairpersons of various committees have been complaining that they have not been given time to present their reports, so from tomorrow, we shall be handling a series of reports of our ad-hoc and select committees which are pending consideration and tomorrow we start with the report of the Public Accounts Committee and those others which are listed on the order paper.

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Madam Speaker, we still have a pending report of Face Technology, I wish it could also be put on line for discussion tomorrow.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Well, have you circulated it?

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA:  Madam Speaker, it was saved on the computer, it is only I to circulate tomorrow.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: If I receive a copy by 11.00 a.m., it will be put on the order paper.

MR KABAREEBE (Rwampara County, Mbarara): Thank you very much Madam Speaker, mine is about the report, which is with the committee responsible for environment in connection with the Nile waters.  

The report is ready and it has been on the shelves for over three years.  I request that in the next considerations, you allow the report be debated.

THE SPEAKER: The Speaker has never stopped it from being debated, so we shall give you opportunity.


MR RUHINDI: Madam Speaker, I remember before we embarked on the constitutional review process, there were reports for debate, and they kept on coming on the agenda till they completely disappeared. 

Of the two one is on election violence and another is a report of my Select Committee on investigations on the disruption of the PAFO meeting in Jinja, which was also never debated but presented. In view of where we are going, I think it is good that those reports be finalised, Madam Speaker.

MRS BWAMBALE: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.  I am not a chair of any committee but I am rising on a point of concern regarding a report of the Domestic Relations Bill, which was presented here, debated and deferred to August, which August has ended.  

It was further deferred because of amending the Constitution; that process has been completed, it is now high time that - we request that it be put on the Order Paper, be debated and the Bill is disposed of, Madam Speaker.  Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable Members, I hope you appreciate that part of our inability to handle this was because of the hectic programme of the constitution amendments, which took so many months. 

But during this week and next week, we shall make an effort to clear as many of them as possible before we go to the electoral laws, which you know are also coming and will require a lot of time and energy but we will do our best.  The House is –(Interruption)

MR KIWALABYE: I was not sure whether you ruled, Madam Speaker, that the committee on the River Nile is coming tomorrow because we need to put in something after interaction with the World Bank officials? 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, if everybody is demanding for tomorrow, I do not know what I will do; just monitor the Order Paper and we shall find time for you.  The House is adjourned to 2.00 p.m. tomorrow.

(The House rose at 4.58 p.m. and adjourned until Thursday 22nd September, 2005 at 2.00 p.m.)
