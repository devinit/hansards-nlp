Parliament met at 2.51 p.m. in Parliament House, Kampala. 

PRAYERS

(The Speaker, Ms Rebecca Alitwala Kadaga, in the Chair.) 

The House was called to order. 

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR 

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I welcome you to this afternoon’s session and do apologise for the delay. This morning we had the first meeting of the Parliamentary Commission which you appointed yesterday to handle some urgent issues, and we also had to agree on the distribution of Members to the committees of the House which we want to do today.  We are really sorry but we shall try to catch up. Hon. Katoto, you had something to say?

2.52
MR HATWIB KATOTO (NRM, Katerera County, Rubirizi): Thank you, Madam Speaker. We all come from different constituencies and different backgrounds but we are all here for the issue of national interest. The matter I am going to raise is of national importance and it is about the depreciation of the Uganda Shilling against the dollar.

Today the shilling was at 2,510 buying and selling at 2,520 – to the dollar, which is appalling to the business community and the economy at large, and if it is not controlled, really, Ugandans are going to suffer. So, I would like you to call upon the Minister of Finance to explain.

MR ODONGA OTTO: Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order in relation to the dress code. I see an honourable member there whose name I don’t know but he is in the plenary without a tie. If I could be helped to know his name; he is on the second row behind the Minister of Public Service. Is that stranger in order to be in this House without a neck tie? I could be helped to know his name. Is he in order? (Laughter)

THE SPEAKER: Can I see the hon. Member? Hon. Members, that is a Kaunda Suit; he is in order. (Applause)  

MR KATOTO: Before I was rudely interrupted by the dress code order, I was still begging you Madam Speaker to call upon any minister to explain and if possible tell us how Bank of Uganda can use its tools to cope with the depreciating Uganda Shilling such that we can save the economy. Thank you very much. 

THE SPEAKER: Is the Minister of Finance here or is the Leader of Government Business noting the issues of national concern?

2.55 
THE THIRD DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (Gen. Moses Ali): Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Government, I would like to take note of the Member’s concerns and we shall cooperate in order to satisfy the Members about the state of the currency, but that should be done by technical people. Thank you. 

2.56
MR ABDU KATUNTU (FDC, Bugweri County, Iganga): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. The point raised by hon. Katoto is actually very crucial to the businesses in this country. Within one day if there is a difference, in the exchange rate, of Shs 100 and someone is trading with a capital of US $1 million, he could actually lose over Shs 30 to 50 million just in one day!

Of course hon. Moses Ali’s response - I think he was just taken unaware and I expected maybe the Minister of Finance to really to come up and explain. You see, we are joking with people’s life. Businesses are winding up; people who are trading using dollars are in real trouble; importers are having problems in balancing their books or even determining the prices of their products. 

Anybody with fair knowledge of international trade knows that 60 percent of the products being consumed are actually being imported. We cannot have this casual answer by hon. Gen. Ali. And you see it reflects what exactly happened here yesterday because Government comes up with a Vote-on-Account and when mistakes are  corrected, they said, “20 minutes” and then they said, “one night” and today they are quiet about it. Is this the service delivery programme the President was promising us? People are asleep; the Government is asleep! So, we need a serious response from Government about what is going on in the economy of this country -(Interruption) 

MR EKANYA: Thank you very much, hon. Katuntu. Madam Speaker, this is a matter that I think the Front Bench can handle. They don’t need to wait for the technical people because when the President was appointing the ministers - and I really respect President Museveni on some issues - he said he had appointed ministers who are technical in their areas and capable to serve in this country. I see very technical and capable ministers on the Front Bench. So, Deputy Leader of Government Business, you have here the Minister of Trade who is a doctor and has worked in the UN and yet we are talking about the problems that traders are faced with and impact on the consumers. 

The Governor Bank of Uganda last week said that it is because of indiscipline by this Government that our reserves now stand at less than what is adequate to sustain us for three months. I did calculations and the Governor said it is only enough to serve this country for four months. 

MR TODWONG: Madam Speaker, is it in order for a Member to rise up and insist that the ministers present should answer the question when the Leader of Government Business in Parliament has already made communication to that effect?

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Member, I think that the Members want an assurance, which is more definite on when the Minister of Finance is coming to answer.

GEN. MOSES ALI: Madam Speaker, first of all, the Opposition did not accept me as the Deputy Leader of Government Business. They are on record and possibly they are trying to push that idea on. But I am speaking, still on behalf of the Government, as Deputy Leader of Government Business in Parliament. So you may like me or not, it doesn’t matter really. I am quite aware - (Interruption)

MS ANYWAR: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise on a point of order. The hon. Minister, instead of directing the relevant minister to handle a very crucial national issue, is here trading blame that the Opposition does not believe in him yet it is a necessity that on his side, he needs to direct one of the ministers to come and give a comprehensive answer and details to this honourable House and to the country at large. Is it in order for the honourable minister in charge to mislead this House and go defensive instead of telling us which minister is supposed to give us all the details? Is he in order?

THE SPEAKER: The hon. Minister was giving you a preamble before he comes to a directive. (Laughter)

GEN. MOSES ALI: Thank you, Madam Speaker. After that preamble, I am sure - I want to again say that we are very much concerned as you are and I want to reiterate my promise that we shall give the Government side answer, thoroughly and technically by technical people. At an appropriate time, we will come back. I can’t say now or tomorrow because I have not consulted but at an appropriate time, we shall make sure we answer and explain the problem of foreign exchange. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I think the matter is now on the Hansard. The Government has undertaken to answer this issue. Let us give them a few days and I will be here to remind them.

3.04
MS LYNDAH TIMBIGAMBA (NRM, Woman Representative, Kyenjojo): Thank you so much, Madam Speaker. Mine is quite different. I am rising on an issue, which is quite sensitive. Within the three weeks, I have registered three incidents of thunder and lightning, which has seen people die within my district. It has been a problem although we have heard it on the news in other districts from Eastern and Northern Uganda. Therefore, I would wish to call it a disaster. Even as I am talking now, I have got a call that some cows have been struck this afternoon. I beg to draw the attention of the House to this sensitive issue. Thank you very much.

3.05
MR ABDU KATUNTU (FDC, Bugweri County, Iganga): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker and I would like to thank the honourable colleague for raising this very important issue. It is not about Kyenjojo only. When you read in the press, whether it is Alebtong or Jinja, students and pupils in schools are being killed by lightning and thunder. In the last ten days or so, we are talking of a figure of almost 15 people and Government should come up and explain what the problem is. (Laughter) They should; I see colleagues amused -

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, it is a serious matter.

MR KATUNTU: I see them amused and I am really confused (Interruption)

MR WADRI: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. The information I would like to give my colleague, whom I wish to thank for having given way, is the fact that under UPE, Government has come up with standardised classroom construction under the School Facilities Grant. Last week when lightning struck in Kiryandongo; it killed children in one of the UPE facilities. Therefore, the information I want to give is that in school construction, which has been designed centrally by Government, there is supposed to be a provision for electrolytes so that in case of thunder striking, there should be a way of transmitting the current from the top of the roof to the earth. That is the information I want to give, and the Government should come up with an explanation as to whether those schools have got those provisions on their roofs so that we are able to avert the incidents of our students being struck by thunder. Thank you.

MR KATUNTU: Thank you very much, colleague for giving the information. In fact, those who went to school during the days of Milton Obote colonial times or even Amin remember that every classroom had that earth rod. Really, I don’t know which school hon. Nasasira went to -(Laughter)– assuming he did -(Interruption)

MR NASASIRA: Thank you, Madam Speaker and I thank my friend, hon. Katuntu for giving way so that he receives the information direct from me. I did go to Kazo Primary School and then joined the famous Ntare School for six years. Maybe when you get on the Floor again, you will tell me, which school you went to because I am also not aware. (Laughter)

MR KATUNTU: Yes, I didn’t doubt that you went to some sort of school but the point I was trying to make is actually if you are constructing a public building, there are standards especially where you know that you have vulnerable people staying in those buildings like children in villages who don’t have shoes. For example, if they had rubber shoes, the situation would be different but these are moving bare footed- (Interruption)

MR KYANJO: Thank you, hon. Member for giving way. I am rising to give my senior colleague the information that when the Member was presenting the matter at preliminary level, she informed the House that she received a call to the effect that cows had been struck by lightning. So, as much as I agree that we must look at the construction of buildings, we must also accept the fact that lightning is becoming a problem not only in buildings but also away from buildings.

I also want to add that yesterday there was an attempt by some Government department to explain the change in weather that has brought this situation but it was equally unsatisfying. So I would like to urge the Members that we should find a solution to this. Those who have gone into further research regarding that particular situation are bringing up the issue that the mushrooming telecommunication masts may not be innocent in this problem. I want the Members to work on the situation at once such that a relevant minister could come and give us a solution. Thank you.

MR KATUNTU: As I conclude, I would like to thank all the colleagues for the information. I can see the matter is quite serious. If we get an answer or a response, then if there are steps to be taken, the political leaders can sensitise the population to take precautions. That is what we are demanding; this is not a laughing matter. I am asking the minister responsible - 

MR MUTENDE: I want to inform my very good friend and old boy. I just want to clear the misinformation that masts might be contributing to this problem. As a matter of fact, it touches a bit on an earlier issue that there were no lightning conductors on the schools that were affected. It is a scientific fact that when you have a high point somewhere on a building or a mast, it cannot bring the lightening but it saves the situation. It saves the animals and people around there because it would pick the lightening and save animals and people in the neighbourhood.

MR KATUNTU: As I conclude I think we need an explanation such that our population actually takes caution. Where I come from thugs had started digging up those rods looking for mercury. Most of those schools no longer have those earth rods because some bad people were digging them up.

MR BALYEKU: Madam Speaker, this is a very serious matter. We should not take it for granted and just debate. People are dying and with earth wire rods, they have to measure to know whether those installations are still measuring up to the standards. It is normally 1.0; it reduces due to the rains. We may also not be safe here in Parliament. It may start raining now and it strikes. So the ministry concerned should team up with Ministry of Education; they take the people of UMEME and measure. We should not even debate this; it should be a Government policy that we start measuring often. This is a matter of people dying; even you MPs can die tonight. 

MR KATUNTU: Really I think Government has taken note, Madam Speaker. I would request that the Chief Whip - hon. Moses Ali talked about something but I do not want to go into that debate - whether we recognise him as leader of government business. This matter is legal and constitutional. So if you are the Leader of Government Business just read the Constitution and see if you qualify to be and there will be no contest about that position. Let the Government take note of this issue, let them consult the technocrats, come up with a report such that we as political leaders mobilise our people and sensitise them accordingly.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I do not know which minister is in charge of lightning, but I just want to say that on Sunday I was in my village and a Mwanainchi telephoned to ask me whether I could explain why some schools are being hit by lightning. Really, people are concerned.

MR NASASIRA: We do not have a ministry in charge of lightning but we do have a ministry in charge of building standards. Lightning has not started today or yesterday. For many years we have had lightning striking buildings, killing cows and other things. So what hon. Katuntu was saying earlier is true. Any standard building should have a conductor because lightning is caused by what we call static electricity. When the positives and the negatives get concentrated then there is a charge and the charge has to be connected through a conductor so that it saves a building. So, if we have had cases where schools have been struck by lightning and there was no lightning conductor then that has been an oversight on this matter and actually the ministry of education is going to take charge and ensure that all schools have got all these lightning conductors. 

MR KEN-LUKYAMUZI: I am standing on a point of order knowing that I am the Shadow Minister in charge of Environment. I think it is time I assisted the Government side to understand the issues related to lightning. Lightning is a natural disaster related to the misbehaviour of clouds, so automatically that occurrence is related to the ministry in charge of environment. I saw the Chief Whip wondering as if he does not know where that falls. Is it right for the Chief Whip to speak when he does not know what he is talking about?

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members it seems to me that this is a multifaceted issue, which involves many ministries. Can we ask Government to come with a statement to inform the country how they are going to handle this problem?

MS ALASO: I thought we could broaden this thing a little. I think it is about adherence to standards in the construction world. Previously we have talked about fire in schools and we have asked whether there has been adherence to standards in our schools; whether all schools have fire extinguishers. Today we will discuss the management of lightning in our schools; tomorrow we will discuss a fire in another school; the next day we will discuss the access rack for people and children with disabilities. I think the ministry of housing needs to bring a broader explanation here on all matters to do with standards, security and safety of houses and buildings which are used ordinarily by the public. By doing that they will tell us about fire safety measures; they will tell us about lightning safety measures; they should also tell us about access by people with disabilities because this House passed an Act.

DR CHEBROT: I thank you, Madam Speaker. First of all, I do not know whether this House can legislate against lightning! This is impossibility.

Secondly, the issue of lightning and standards at schools really lies with all of us in this House and it is not a matter for the Government or the Opposition. What we do know is this –

THE SPEAKER: Point of order.

MS ANYWAR: I rise on a point of order. The issue we are discussing is very pertinent and as legislators in this country, we ought to give a way forward to this country.

Madam Speaker, you have already directed and guided this House that the minister gives us a detailed explanation on the way forward. Is the honourable minister in order to come and start confusing the House and even saying that we are not supposed to legislate against nature and yet we are sitting here as legislators and we are supposed to give a way forward to this country? Is he in order?

THE SPEAKER: Really hon. Members, I had made a ruling and said that this matter appears to be multi-faceted; now we are talking about classrooms but the cows are not in the classrooms but somewhere else. So, we are requiring the Government to explain to the country what is happening and how they should manage it. Please, let us end this issue. We need to debate some other business. 

MR NASASIRA: I think we have heard your ruling. As a Government, we shall come and talk and find more causes of lightning but we shall not include the behaviour of clouds as hon. Lukyamuzi says -(Laughter)- because lightning is scientific and we shall come and give a clear statement on that. I think we should sympathise with all the losses so that we close this chapter.

THE SPEAKER: The next item!

23.	Hon. Sanjay Tanna, Tororo Municipality, Independent
24.	Hon. Byayaga Andrew Ajar, Kabale Municipality, Independent
25.	Hon. Mpuuga Mathias, Masaka Municipality, Independent

THE SPEAKER: Yes, hon. Kyanjo.

MR KYANJO: I am rising on a matter that touches a constituency that used to be known as Makindye West and does not exist on the list read. We have had two Members, the hon. Member from the East and I was also read as Makindye East. I wanted to discover through you whether that constituency has been merged into one with two representatives –(Laughter)- or it still exists as Makindye West.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Member, you know this is a submission from the Opposition Chief Whip and they brought it late. Anyway, if you are the Member for Makindye West then the other one should be for Makindye East, not so? Okay, then just forget about that because we already know that hon. Hussen Kyanjo is the Member for one of the Makindye constituencies and he is from JEEMA. Yes, hon. Okupa.

MR OKUPA: Madam Speaker, I have not heard my name in that list yet I did submit it to my whip although she is not here. Otherwise, she had confirmed that I would remain a Member of that committee for purposes of continuity; she had concurred with me on that.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Member, my submission is that your whip placed you on the Budget Committee and that is what I have here.

MR OKUPA: I would prefer to be on the COSASE –(Interruptions)– you are making noise, but you should know that varying in this House - this is not the first time it is happening. I would like to beg the indulgency of the Leader of the Opposition on this matter.

3.32
THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Mr Nathan Nandala-Mafabi): Thank you, Madam Speaker. As you are aware, hon. Elijah Okupa has been a Member of the Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises; but while that is true, we are also trying to deploy our people into areas that are demanding, for example, where he has been deployed is also another demanding area. We strongly believe that he will utilize his competence attained from the previous committee in that area. As the Opposition, we have deployed him elsewhere.

MS NAMBOOZE: Madam Speaker, yes names are being read out but we are not getting them properly. I am wondering whether we can get copies of the lists for us to follow. I beg to submit.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, one of the reasons we started as late as 3.00 p.m. is that your whips delivered these lists late. I sat in the VIP Lounge for an hour; they brought in the lists late. I also need to get my committees in place. I think you just listen carefully. Otherwise, if you have objections to where you have been placed, you should go and negotiate with your whips; they can come back to the House with new lists, but for now these are the submissions from your whips.

DR BARYOMUNSI: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I am rising on a point of clarification. While the whips have the mandate to designate Members, wouldn’t it be proper that as committees are being constituted, Members are consulted? I am saying this because assigning a Member to a committee where they feel uncomfortable can undermine their competencies. This should be done in a consultative manner in future.

THE SPEAKER: But I don’t think the Speaker wants to engage into the operations of the offices of the whips. Really you spare me that! If you have problems, go back to your whips. They will present new lists to the House after making some changes.

I now put the question that that committee be approved as proposed.

(Question put and agreed to.)

MS AOL: Madam Speaker, I think it should be corrected that hon. Akora Maxwell is UPC and not FDC. Please, correct the record.

MR SSEMUJJU: Madam Speaker, I am Ssemujju Ibrahim Nganda, the elected MP, Kyadondo East. I think a coup has been staged. I have heard someone called Abraham Ssemujju being read as the MP for that constituency and from NRM -(Laughter) 

THE SPEAKER: I think that the party was corrected. If there was an attempted coup, we can quash it. (Laughter)

GEN. TUMWINE: They left out the name for the UPDF representative; hon. Gen. Aronda Nyakairima.

MR LOLEM: Madam Speaker, I find my name Lolem Micah Akasile in Equal Opportunities and National Economy so, what should I do? Should I decide to be on one or I go with both?

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I put the question that this House do approve the committee as proposed.

(Question put and agreed to.)

GEN. TUMWINE: I think the clerk is forgetting to read UPDF.

MR BITEKYEREZO: Correction, Madam Speaker. My name is very poorly-spelt. It is Bitekyerezo Medard, Mbarara Municipality. There is something I heard and it was not mine. (Laughter) 

THE SPEAKER: In response to hon. Tumwine; you know there are only 10 UPDF Members and there are 13 committees. I do not know whether you have enough to fill all the committees. Have they all been allocated? 

GEN. TUMWINE: Madam Speaker, she read the name and the committees are all allocated. 

MS MUJUNGU: Madam Speaker, I have not heard my name on any of the committees. 

THE SPEAKER: We have not yet completed.

MS MUJUNGU: For the standing committees.

THE SPEAKER: We have not finished. We still have one committee. We have not done Science and Technology.
 
MS AOL: Madam Speaker, there is a slight correction. Hon. Ssasaga Isaias is from Budadiri County East not West. 

THE SPEAKER: But those were your submissions. Can you tell me where hon. Mujungu is for the standing committees? She is on Budget? Okay, hon. Mujungu, you are on the Standing Committee for Budget. 

Let us go to Science and Technology –(Interjections)– no, the Business Committee will comprise the chairpersons of the committees once they are constituted. 

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Madam Speaker, there was a slight mistake where Members were put on the Business Committee yet they are supposed to be on other committees. So, we want to make a correction now. Hon. Betty Nambooze, Mukono Municipality, DP, should be moved from the Business Committee to the Local Government Accounts Committee –(Interjections)- what I mean is that the Business Committee consists of chairpersons and not normal Members of Parliament. So, there were some Members who were put on that committee whom we are now moving to other committees. 

MS TIMBIGAMBA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I also did not hear my name on the standing committees.

MS ASAMO: Madam Speaker, I also did not hear my name. 

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Nebanda, you also did not hear your name?

MS LANYERO: I did not hear my name either.

THE SPEAKER: Dr Omoma, you also did not hear your name?

DR OMOMA: No. 

DR EPETAIT: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I see that if we are to go the way we are going, we might take a long time here. I suggest that those Members, whose names may not have appeared in any committee, get back to their whips and let the whips correct the lists and get back to the House.

THE SPEAKER: But, honourable members, we need to know them so that we can direct the whips? So, Members who did not hear their names, stand up so that we record your names. Hon. Mulimba, Lanyero, hon. Timbigamba, hon. Serena, hon. Lokeris, hon. Mpiima –(Interjections)- use a microphone.

MR MUHUMUZA: I also did not hear my name. 

THE SPEAKER: Okay, hon. Mulongo, I think you were called Stephen but you are Simon; I heard Simon Mulongo. Hon. Members, I am trying to solve your problem. I am saying that any Member who has not been named on a standing committee stand up and give us your names.

MS OKETAYOT: Madam Speaker, I am Lowila Oketayot and I have not heard my name.

THE SPEAKER: Okay, please make the record. Hon. Otada, you have not heard your name? Hon. Ababiku, you did not hear your name?

MS ABABIKU: I did not hear my name. 

THE SPEAKER: Are you not an independent?

MS ABABIKU: I am an independent.

THE SPEAKER: I placed you somewhere. Hon. Ssempijja, you have also not been placed anywhere?

MR SSEMPIJJA: I have not heard my name and you are my whip, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: No, I placed you somewhere – and who is the other Member who has not been placed?

MR ATIKU: Madam Speaker, I am Atiku Benard; I have not heard my name.

MS CHEMUTAI: Madam Speaker, I am Chemutai Phyllis, Woman Representative Kapchorwa, and I have not heard my name. 

THE SPEAKER: I want to assure the independents that I placed all of them. Why she has not read your name, I do not know. Hon. Odoi, I think I placed you on the rules committee.

Hon. Members, we have taken a lot of those Members who think they were not placed – hon. Kase-Mubanda, were you not placed? 

MS NEBANDA: Madam Speaker, my name is Nebanda Cerinah, Woman MP, Butaleja District. I think you have seen the problems that we are facing. They start reading the names when we do not have copies. So, I suggest that next time they present, let them provide us with copies so that we can follow and know which Members are there and which Members are not there so that we do not have this problem again. My name was not included in the standing committees and I am worried that I was not included. But I have a feeling that I will be put on any committee. 

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, to solve that, we are going to pin the names on the notice board. And if there are still Members who are still not on, they should draw the attention of their whips to it or let them come to me. 

Let us move on to the ssessional committees – okay, let us first hear from the chief whip. 

MR NASASIRA: Madam Speaker, we want to make a correction. The name of hon. Amero Susan was read on the Committee of Local Government Accounts. I want to make a correction that it should be only read on the Committee of Rules, Privileges and Discipline and not on the Local Government Committee. 

MS AOL: Madam Speaker, we have some of our Members’ names appearing on the Business Committee and this should be corrected. They are hon. Okumu Reagan, hon. Atiku Benard, and hon. Betty Nambooze. We are going to have the three placed on different committees - we have hon. Ekwau Ibi Florence whose name also appeared on the Business Committee. I think hon. Kiiza Winifred is a Member of the Business Committee.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Kiiza is an ex-officio and so she should not take somebody’s place there. Let us go to the ssessional committees. We shall pin up the names. If there are Members who are still absent let the whips know or let me know. Now; let us move on to the ssessional committees.

MR BAKALUBA: Madam Speaker, they have read hon. Peace Kusaasira as a Member of Parliament from Nakifuma but she is from Mukono District.

THE SPEAKER: Yes, that will be corrected.

MS EGUNYU: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I heard my name read on the Social Services Committee or the committee, which was read before Social Services Committee but I never expressed my interest there. I expressed my interest on the agriculture committee where the whip designated me as the vice-chairperson of that committee.

MR LOLEM: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Lokii John Baptist is a Member of Parliament representing Matheniko so when they said Lokii John Baptist for Dodoth East, this is Lokeris Samson.

THE SPEAKER: Can we hear from the whip?

MR NASASIRA: Madam Speaker, that is correct. The last name on the list of NRM, Lokii John Baptist, should be Matheniko. Equally name number 14 of hon. Mwesigye Fred should be deleted because it is on presidential committee. Hon. Egunyu Nantume was actually not read on the Committee of Social Services, she was read on the Committee of Public Service and Local Government. That should be deleted from there and be in agriculture committee as it has been read.

THE SPEAKER: Okay. Can you also move hon. Mpuuga to the Committee on Presidential Affairs?

MR NASASIRA: Again, hon. Kasaija Kagwera, who was read as Kyegegwa last time, should not be on this list. Number 18 should be deleted.

THE SPEAKER: Okay, hon. Members, I put the question that this House do approve the committee as proposed.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I put the question that this House approve the committee as proposed.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE SPEAKER: Is there any Member who has not been placed on a ssessional committee?

MR ISABIRYE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. My name is Iddi Isabirye. I represent the people of Bunya South and not Bunya East. I thank you.

THE SPEAKER: That is corrected.

MS NAMOE: Madam Speaker, I have not heard my name in any ssessional committee. I am Namoe Stella, Woman MP, Napak.

THE SPEAKER: Where would you like to go, hon. Namoe?

MS NAMOE: Committee on Agriculture where I had shown my interest but surprisingly I have not heard my name.

MR NASASIRA: Madam Speaker, I henceforth nominate the honourable to be on the committee on agriculture.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, hon. Namoe is also added to the committee on agriculture.

MS KOMUHANGI: Thank you, Madam Speaker. My name has not appeared on any ssessional committee and I had expressed interest in the Natural Resources Committee. 

THE SPEAKER: Your name is here, you are number 21.

MS KOMUHANGI: I withdraw, Madam Speaker. I had not heard it.

MS OSEGE: Thank you so much, Madam Speaker. I didn’t hear my name on any ssessional committee. I am Osege Angeline. I am on a standing committee but no ssessional committee. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Can the whip do something? Where do you want to serve?

MS AOL: We have taken note of that.

THE SPEAKER: You will allocate her later? Tell us where you want to serve.

MS AOL: I think it is an omission; we can take her to where she wants or prefers.

MS OSEGE: I will discuss it with the whip, thank you.

MS NAMUGWANYA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I appreciate the fact that we couldn’t be allocated the committees we applied for but unfortunately you find two people from the same district put on one committee. For instance, for ssessional committee, hon. Anthony Ssemmuli and I were put on the same committee. When it came to the standing committees, again I am with hon. Mulindwa from the same district. We would request that much as we are not going to discuss the interests of districts, we need to be spread over. Thank you very much.

MR NASASIRA: Madam Speaker, my proposal is that those few amendments could be done and then at an appropriate time we come to the House and correct them.

While I am still on the Floor, I would like the name of hon. Kafabusa Werikhe to be cancelled from the Committee on Infrastructure. It is number 10. This is because he is on the Committee on Natural Resources. 

THE SPEAKER: Okay. Members, if there are any who are still not satisfied, please talk to your whips and you can talk to me if you are independent. Now I want to invite the whips to name the chairpersons. Hon. Aol?

MS AOL: Madam Speaker, hon. Osege Angeline from Soroti said she would prefer to be on Social Services Committee and we have accepted her to be there.

THE SPEAKER: Can you add hon. Osege to the Committee on Social Services? I had asked you to name your chairpersons. I think we have handled all the committees, haven’t we?

MS AOL: We have the Chairperson of Public Accounts Committee being hon. Kassiano Wadri from Terego. His Vice-Chairperson is hon. Akora Maxwell, UPC, Maruzi. 
  
Hon. Odonga Otto (FDC) – Chairperson, Committee on Government Assurances.

Hon. Nabilah Naggayi (FDC) - Deputy Chairperson, Committee on Government Assurances. 

On the Committee of Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises we have; hon. Patrick Amuriat (FDC) – Chairperson.

Hon. Angelline Osegge (FDC) – Deputy Chairperson.

On the Committee on Local Government Accounts, we have;
Hon. Jack Sabiti (FDC) – Chairperson; and hon. Florence Namayanja (DP) as the Deputy Chairperson.

2.	The deputy chairperson will be designated next week.

Those are the chairpersons and vice-chairpersons, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I notice that neither the Government nor the Opposition have taken into account the Independents in selecting the chairpersons. I have also noted that none of the sides has made the 30 percent representation for women as chairpersons of committees.

MR NASASIRA: Madam Speaker, as you noted in our presentation for the chairpersons and vice-chairpersons, we have left one chairperson and one vice and we are discussing with Independents on this matter.

As for the gender balance, we think we have about 28 percent, we would have wished to have more but the system of selecting is based on showing interest first. And from the list of those who had shown interest, we tried to take as many ladies as possible but we hope we shall improve since these ssessional committees are just for one year.

MRS CECILIA OGWAL: I noticed particularly from the Government side that for every committee, the vice-chairperson is a woman -(Interjections)- I said “almost” and not absolute, is it possible for the Whip on the Government side to reverse the leadership so that the women take the chairperson position because they have the largest number of committees, since they have 12 ssessional committees? When this country decided that for the first time in the history of Uganda that a woman becomes the Speaker of Parliament, the writing was on the wall that things must change and it is very important that women should stop accepting to be vice-chairpersons.

Why should we willingly accept to be vice-chairpersons? They should first acknowledge our credentials that we can make better leadership then wecan choose who should be our vice-chairperson, but this is a trend now. I am targeting the Movement side now because they are the majority -(Interjections)- who are you to say, “no”? You were a whip and you did not do anything!

MS BETTY AMONGI: Madam Speaker, I stand to register on this Floor the disappointment on the progress we had made before. In the last Parliament, I think the Government side had really given us hope as women and there were many women who were chairpersons of committees and surely these women did a very good job. For example, the Chairperson of the Committee of Social Services was a woman, hon. Seninde whose committee was heightened to a level that they toured this country and the committee came to a very good level. 

The Committee on Budget which was chaired by hon. Rose Akol did very well and she was a new comer in the last Parliament. Surely, I know many of these women applied but on this list we have 18 –(Interjections)- I am speaking about both sides – on government [HON. NASASIRA: “Point of Order.”] no, I am speaking on both sides. Hon. Minister, I will come to both sides –(Interruption)

MR NASASIRA: As I rise on a point of order, I really appreciate our lady friends from the Opposition; my elder sister, hon. Cecilia Ogwal and hon. Amongi, my auntie hon. Cecilia Ogwal – but the number of women this side is really interesting and they are now trying to challenge Government and claim that we do not consider women.

In the list I read of chairpersons, there were women chairpersons [HON. AMONGI: “There are three.”] But in the list of the Opposition I heard, there was no single chairperson who is a woman –(Applause)- [HON. AMONGI: “I am coming to that.”] I only heard three female sounding names. Is it in order for the hon. Member holding the Floor to start trying to remove a speck from our eyes when there is a big log in the eye of the Opposition?

MS AMONGI: Madam Speaker, I had said that I was going to speak about both sides of the House [HON. MEMBERS: “Ruling?”]

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, even though we have two sides of the House, I think as a country we are party to the CEDAW and the Beijing Platform for Action which are commitments we have made. (Applause)

MS AMONGI: I am going to come to this side of the House but I was saying that even in our Constitution, Article 33 talks of one third representation of women. Now, in out of 18 committees on the Government side, there are only three women who are chairpersons [HON. MEMBER: “One.”] they are three; I think Agriculture, HIV/AIDS and Equal Opportunities which does not even meet the benchmark of one third which is in the Constitution. 

When I come to this side of the House, out of four committee chairpersons, they do not even have one woman – one woman as chairperson. How can I sit on this side of the House as a woman -(Applause)- -(Interjections)- no, I want to say it because when we come to issues of women, it is constitutional like the Speaker said we signed the CEDAW, we have our Constitution and there must be one third representation of women in the leadership. 

Now, we come to this side of the House and out of four chairpersons, you do not even have the courtesy to have one woman chairing, which is unfair! 

I want us to agree that this House meets the benchmark of one third representation. Both sides must meet the one third representation as spelt out in the Constitution. We cannot accept this as women because the Constitution is very clear; the Opposition and Government have both not met the one third representation of women and we cannot approve this, Madam Speaker. [HON. MEMBERS: “Motion.”]

5.06
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): I thank you very much. Whereas I think hon. Cecilia Ogwal is making a good point, I do not know if this is really the place to make that argument because according to our rules, it is the parties that designate membership of committees and the Speaker actually announces the names of those designated to committees in accordance with rule 134. 

Rule 134 reads as follows: “Representation on Standing Committees;
(1) The Members of Standing Committees shall be selected from among Members of Parliament.
(2) In the selection of Members of Standing Committees, the parties represented in Parliament shall designate through the Whips, Membership to Committees on the basis of party representation in the House.” 

And then (8) says: “Members designated under this rule shall be announced by the Speaker in Parliament and accordingly assume their respective Membership or offices.”

So, I think these good ideas that are coming up are ideas that we ought to have carried out in our parties when were going through the process of designation.

MS BETTY AMONGI: I thank you Rt hon. Prime Minister. I would like to know whether in consideration of the Rules of Procedure you have read that you would be barred from within your party to ensure that you take into consideration Article 32 and 33 of the Constitution. 

Article 33(4) says: “Women shall have the right to equal treatment with men, and that right shall include equal opportunities in political, economic and social activities.” 

In the context where you even go to the Local Government Act in the Parliamentary Elections Act, it is specific on one third representation. So, whether you should not consider some of those Acts that are passed by this Parliament in selection of those - and I think that is why in the last Parliament, those issues were addressed. The Rules of Procedure do not bar you from or permit you to abrogate the Constitution or to even discard some of the provisions which are in the other Acts of Parliament.

MS ALASO: I thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I think the House must admit that this is a rude awakening that we are all alert and the whole country is looking at the practices we adopt in this House. I think it is important to step backwards and see what we have done to ourselves as a Parliament. We are the ones who have been passing laws in this House providing for adherence to the Constitution for many commissions. For all those commissions and statutory bodies, we have been saying that women composition should be a-third yet inside here in the very heart of public representation, we cannot adhere to those practices. What will happen when we finally pass an Act in this House and people do not adhere to it? I know we will shout from here that it is unconstitutional yet right in here we swear to uphold the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda – the same Constitution says that all those practices that are inconsistent with it are bad practices; they should be regarded as null and void.

So, together as a House, I think we are upholding a practice that is inconsistent with the Constitution. As Members, we should reflect on this matter. Besides, when the honourable Prime Minister tries to make this a matter of whips, it becomes a little complicated. This is the final appeal place where the women of Uganda have to come to. They are now petitioning you, Madam Speaker. It may be because things may not have worked in the committees; they may not have worked well with the whips. That is why the whips are presenting those reports with 100 or 70 percent without women representation in the committees. So, my thinking is that we should not go back to the whips, Madam Speaker. We plead that you ask the whips to reflect on this matter again. Thank you. (Applause)

MR MUJUNI: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. Whereas I appreciate the fact that women should be represented in Article 33, I also would like to bring to the attention of this House Article 90 of the same Constitution, which says: “Parliament shall appoint committees necessary for the efficient discharge of its functions and that Parliament shall, by its Rules of Procedure, prescribe the powers, composition and functions of its committees.”

So, pursuant to rule 134(6), which states: “The party or organisation in Government shall designate the chairperson and deputy chairpersons of each standing committee of Parliament.” Whereas I appreciate the fact that we are not living up to Commonwealth parliamentary standards, I also appreciate the fact that the Rules of Procedure onto which we are basing in regard to the composition of the committees do not prescribe how much, in terms of membership, the gender representation should be. Therefore, I would like to move that the names given need not be debated further because the law says that the party whips shall designate and they will take offices therein. I thank you.

MS ANN NANKABIRWA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. It would really be sad for me, because I sit on this side, to abrogate and not to support the principles of affirmative action for which I am here. Uganda prescribes to the Beijing Platform of Action –(Applause)– the women in this country appreciate – that is why we have the Speaker of Parliament of Uganda in the name of Rebecca Kadaga. (Applause) I wish that whenever we talk about issues regarding affirmative action, we should not go partisan; these issues cut across no matter whether you on the right or left side of this House. Comrades, we must admit that it was an error, if that is not provided for in the rules of procedure. And now that we have seen it, we should come out to correct it. 

THE SPEAKER: You did not mention your name and constituency for the Hansard to capture.

MS ANN MARIA NANKABIRWA: Madam Speaker, my view is that if the House agrees, the whips should be given time to adjust the lists of the names of chairpersons and vice chairpersons. Also at a later time when we amend the Rules of Procedure, we should consider – I do acknowledge that my party’s Constitution gives way for 40 percent women representation – not even a third.

MR OGWANG: Thank you very, Madam Speaker. I would like to say that we should acknowledge the fact that there is a problem on both sides of the House, Government and Opposition. If we respect the Constitution, let us talk one language. It will be very shameful for us to approve these chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of the committees when the interests of the women have not been catered for. I would like to beg the leadership of my party to reflect on the interests of our women before it comes back to the august House with complete documents. Thank you very much.

MR MIGADDE: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. When you got into that high office, we all thought that women had really reached where they wanted to be, but it seems like that has just displaced so many women in other positions. It is on that note that, in honour of my mother, my wife and the daughter I am expecting, I would like to suggest that the whips go and change these lists. (Applause) Actually, it should not even be a third; it should be more than that. Thank you very much.

DR LYOMOKI: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. The point being discussed in regard to the representation of women is pertinent. However, my approach would be for us to look at the composition of this House because if we start talking about proportional representation in terms of numbers, we might miss a point. We must look at the number of women before we get into the details. There is need for us to look at the proportional representation in terms of the way women are elected into this House. Can we maybe first look at the percentage of women in this House?

MR ANDREW ALLEN: Thank you, Madam Speaker. What I have realised is we are looking at Rules of Procedure, which is fine, but we also have national policies. Equal opportunities are a national policy. If we do not lead by example here in this Ninth Parliament, then we are going in the wrong direction. Women should be given an opportunity to be chairpersons just like we the Independents want an opportunity to chair some of these committees. 

THE SPEAKER: Leader of the Opposition and Government, are you really averse to reviewing this situation to comply with the Constitution? We are holding other bodies accountable as a Parliament.

MR NASASIRA: Madam Speaker, let us not be misunderstood on our support for women and even our love for them. As you know, in the NRM, chairpersons and their deputies were announced here. Out of 36, ten were women. I think if I may talk for the other side; the Opposition, out of the ones they announced, I think three or four were women. Our system is that for each committee, we requested those who were away or interested to offer themselves to serve as chairpersons and the men and women presented their names. Of course, there are many other considerations apart from gender. At the end of the day, the percentage of women and men we took from those who applied matched. When we had finished as a party, yesterday we had a caucus and cleared ourselves concerning the names.

I think it is something that we cannot, on both sides – Madam Speaker you remember that in a year we are going to restructure the committees. It will also be disappointing when somebody has been offered as a chair and you say, “Leave and put a woman there.” The women and men take this seriously when they apply and in a year’s time when the new structures of committees is in place, we will agree on the percentage of women so that we can move forward.

MR KATUNTU: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I would like to thank hon. Cecilia Ogwal and hon. Amongi for raising this very important point. Sometimes in circumstances like these, we do not have to be emotional because if we do then we lose out. I think all of us agree in principle because it has been entrenched in the Constitution of the country but also in our various party constitutions about emancipation of women and giving them equal opportunities. As a country, we need to see how far we have moved. Sometimes if we struggle like it is “us against them”, we do not make progress. We actually need to move together. I would like to give an example about the situation pertaining to the Opposition because we were not looking at just chairpersons. We were looking at leadership positions, which were available to the Opposition and I will try to take you through them.

One, for example, the Opposition Chief Whip is a woman. It was not by accident and we have other leadership positions. The item next on the Order Paper is supposed to be our representative to the Pan African Parliament and we have one position. We have given it to a lady, it is coming.

We have looked at our representative to the CPA and we have said it is to a lady. Some of these positions, and I am sure it pertains to the other side opposite me, are sort of negotiated here and there and balanced to all entities.

For example, on our side, we thought we need to be all inclusive of all the parties -(Interruption)

MS AKELLO: Madam Speaker, you guided this House on the issue of deployment on committees but I can see my honourable Attorney-General in the Shadow Cabinet is concentrating on deployment in other areas other than committees and your guidance was very clear. You were asking why the Opposition has scored negative and the NRM side has scored zero percent on deployment. So, could you guide us? (Laughter)

MR KATUNTU: Really, I imagine all of us should be given opportunity to make a point. It serves no purpose for anybody to say, “You have already decided, so we do this”. In matters like these, it is better we move with consensus. I don’t even see it as a very big problem in my view because what we are trying to do is say, “Look here, can we have everybody access a leadership position?” But if we just look at chairs! To me, for example, if a representative of this House in the Pan African Parliament where I have had privilege to represent could actually, for all intents and purposes, be far bigger than a committee chair because I have served in both offices - I have been a committee chairperson but I have also been a Member of the Pan African Parliament. It is far bigger so it is about balancing these positions and my view is that the situation is not, if we are to be honest to ourselves, as bad as people want to make it. It is not perfect, yes but it is not as bad.

My view and suggestion because why I am emphasising this is because I do not want us to go legalistic - (interruption)

MS KABAYENDA: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. Is it in order for the hon. Member to start dwelling and even diverting us from a point? When we talk of a third representation, we are not talking about leadership but handling points of leadership one by one.

Secondly, is it in order for the honourable member to negotiate and compromise a constitutional matter? 

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I asked a question which no one has answered yet. Are we complying with the constitutional provisions? That is what I asked. No one has answered me yet.

MR KATUNTU: Madam Speaker, I thought I was on the Floor. I beg that you give me an opportunity to summarise and then other Members can have their own views.

Even when you raise a point of order or procedure; it will not sort out this problem. It will – anyway, what I suggest - in my own view and I am talking with authority from my leader because I have been party to this haggling. In our party and the entire Opposition about this position we have brought – in fact, I must say that there was an elaborate process, very elaborate consultations -(Interjections)- yes and almost everybody on our side was involved including our party Secretary-General -(Interjections)- yes, it was. So to me –(Interjections)- and that is the position we are being put in –(Interjections)- where we have negotiated something and now there is a debate and party organs –(Interjections)- have taken decisions on this. So, I conclude, Madam Speaker. I conclude that, yes, the concerns of the Members have been taken and I imagine that the side I belong to, including our Leader of Opposition, have taken note of this.

For the ssessional committees, the review is every ssession. For the standing committees, it is after every two and a half years. The rules committee, if it has been put in place, is going to review the rules and these are the sort of issues – we do not have to be legalistic, but eventually they will be entrenched in our rules to conform to the objective because the provision being cited in the Constitution is about principles and objectives. I thank you, Madam Speaker. (Laughter) 

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: Well, I thank you, Madam Speaker. I yielded the Floor to the Hon. Amongi who was seeking clarification from me and then the flood came. I just want to make two points.

One is that certainly, at least on our side and I have no reason to believe that it is the same case in the Opposition; we subscribe to the idea which the NRM has championed from the time when we captured power here that we must –(Interjections)- yes, we are the ones. We, the NRM –(Laughter)- have always championed affirmative action to all those groups that had been marginalised. The provision, which the hon. Amongi read is, of course, correct. It says, “full and equal,” whatever she read - but to do this thing, we must do it practically. You know, for example, how do you achieve 50 percent representation on a gender basis? You have to look at what you have and strive to move towards achieving that objective as much as you can. 

In my view as I said, these rules - I think we have said it before – are the rules that we make ourselves. We are the people who are either going to keep this rule as it is or change it. But until we change it, we must live by it. My suggestion is –(Interruption) 

GEN. TUMWINE: Thank you, Madam Speaker and the Leader of Government Business. I rise to give you information in regard to these rules. I have gone through these rules and the different rules of the different Parliaments that we have been amending until it reached the point when we entered the multi-party dispensation. The parties made rules that were against the Constitution. I observed that and I was getting concerned that the parties are even taking away the rights of the citizens because they are in power. When you look at the rules – while Article 32 of the Constitution talks about affirmative action, about marginalised groups; when you look at the representation of this Parliament which includes the Movement, the Opposition, the Independents, the UPDF; many of the rules are talking about party, party, party! They abandon the membership of the UPDF, of the Independents and –(Applause)- we do not attend the caucus. We do not decide. So, the point I am making and the information I am giving, Madam Speaker, is that we better go and change the rules so that they conform with the Constitution. 

The NRM has come a long way; the struggle of the Movement. The question of women representation should not be a discussion any more –(Interjections)- it is a foregone case. You either comply with the Constitution or you are against the Constitutions. (Applause)

THE SPEAKER: Let the Prime Minister conclude then I go to the Independents.

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: I thank the hon. Gen. Tumwine for that information, but the simple point I was making honourable colleagues is that these are our rules. I am not opposing what anyone is saying now; I am simply saying we have every opportunity to amend the rules either to bring them in conformity with the Constitution where we think they are not in conformity or even amend the Constitution itself if we think the Constitution does not comply with the demands of any particular social group in our society. And we are open to that. But the simple point I am making is that once we have rules, if we find any problem with any rule, the answer is not to act in defiance of the rule –(Interjections)- I am just concluding but my simple proposal is that when we come to amending these rules –(Interruption)

MR AYENA: Madam Speaker, in the beginning, there was the Constitution, which begat all the laws and other regulations that govern us. Is it in order for the Rt Hon. Prime Minister to impress it upon us that where there is a conflict between the Constitution and mere rules and regulations, that the rules should prevail over the provisions of the Constitution? 

If you look at the objectives and directive principles of the Constitution, it clearly states: “The State shall ensure gender balance and fair representation of marginalised groups on all constitutional and other bodies”. We are delivering a point, which is becoming redundant. The Constitution is very clear that in all facets on society, it does not matter –(Interjections)-  therefore, is it in order for the Prime Minister or any other person to convince this august House that because they have done well for the women in one facet of society, therefore, when it comes to chairing the committees of the House, then we should not apply the same rule?

THE SPEAKER: No, I think what the Prime Minister was saying was that our rules may not be in conformity with the Constitution and that we should move to make them compliant with the Constitution. 

MR TANNA: Madam Speaker, I would like to thank you for this opportunity but I think we are thrashing the rules for no good reason. We are reading the rules selectively. I think this issue is extremely obvious; not only is the Constitution superior, but I would like to read from our Rules of Procedure. Rule 134(3): “Unless otherwise provided in these rules, and so far as reasonably practicable, the overall membership of committees shall reflect proposal membership.” 

We are aware that there are 34 percent of women in the House, so it must be proportionate; we are arguing outside the rules. It goes ahead to say, “Taking into consideration the numerical strength of the parties and the interests of Independent Members of Parliament.”

I have heard both sides reading chairpersons, but the Independents are not chairing any committee, we are not deputising on any committee –(Interruption)

MS AKELLO: Thank you, hon. Tanna for giving way. You are raising a very important issue on the Independents. In the beginning of this Parliament, the Speaker informed the House that her office was going to take care of the Independents. So, I would have expected the Office of the Speaker to handle the Independents on committees as well.

THE SPEAKER: They have been handled – the issue is not membership or the composition. The composition is okay. The issue is the leadership of the committees.

MR TANNA: As I conclude, Madam Speaker, I would like to reiterate that if we go by our Rules of Procedure, and I agree with hon. Tumwine that we should push for the necessary amendments at the appropriate time, when you look at the issue of numerical strength, we are the second largest group. And considering that, we have not got any chair on any committee – really if we consider our Rules of Procedure –(Interjections)– I would like to request –(Interruption)

MR KATUNTU: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I think we need to be very careful here. All independents are actually independent of each other. Once you lump yourselves together as a group, then you actually seize to be independent. So, my own interpretation of the rules is that all independents were elected on their individual merit. So the moment you come here and say, “We are a group”, you are actually offending the Constitution. 

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I propose that we adjourn the House and sleep over this matter and take a decision tomorrow. The House is adjourned to 2 O’clock tomorrow. 

(House rose at 5.47 p.m. and was adjourned until Wednesday, 29 June 2011 at 2.00 p.m.)
