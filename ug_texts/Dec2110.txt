COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Members I want to welcome you to today’s session. We have two businesses and one of them is ready, but the second one is not. So I am proposing to suspend the House until 2 O’clock so that we can handle both items.

House is suspended until 2 O’clock.

The House was suspended at 11.20 a.m.

(On resumption at 2.24 p.m., the Speaker presiding_)

THE SPEAKER: Where is the chairperson of the committee? Okay, next item, since he is not there.

PRESENTATION, CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE ON THE SUPPLEMENTARY SCHEDULE NO.1 FOR THE FY 2010/2011

THE SPEAKER: Where is the chairperson of the committee? He is not available? I think with this we come to the end of today’s proceedings.

I want to take this opportunity to wish you a happy Christmas and a happy new year and peaceful campaigns. Do not abuse each other, do not tear people’s posters; be mature and sober.
