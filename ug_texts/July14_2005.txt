The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I regret to inform you that the mother of hon. Idah Mehangye, the MP for Kamwenge District, passed away. So she is unable to be with us today. I ask members to stand up for a minute of silence and then we proceed with our business.

(The Members stood and observed a minute of silence.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Secondly, tomorrow morning we shall launch the Parliamentary Forum for Children in the Parliamentary gardens at 10 O’clock. You are all invited to join us at this function.

My third communication concerns our work. Yesterday the Speaker had indicated that you might go away at the end of this week for a recess to canvass for the referendum. We have reviewed the situation and we would like to propose that we release you on Wednesday. You will still have time to canvass for the referendum in your constituencies.

The second reason we do not want you to go today is because the clouds are forming and there will be rain. So we would like you to go during the rainy season. Please, bear with us and let us attend to our duties diligently. Thank you.

10.43
MR KEN LUKYAMUZI (Lubaga Division South, Kampala): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.  I would like to thank you for those promising words about the rains. I am seeking guidance on a matter related to procedure. Some time back the Speaker undertook the responsibility to constitute a committee, which would examine details related to the political roadmap. I would like to know how far the committee has gone in its deliberations?  

Two, what are we expecting from the committee and how are we going to benefit from the results of the committee as Members of Parliament and the people we represent?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the work of the committee is obvious that is why I have just told you that we have evaluated the situation and we shall work until next week. That is the work of that committee. And about starting the work with regard to this matter of the transition, you have already benefited from it.  

BILLS
COMMITTEE STAGE

THE CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT NO. 3) BILL, 2005 

Clause 55

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chairperson, clause 55 is intended to amend Article 163 and that is on the office of the Auditor-General. The committee examined the proposal and has come out with two amendments that we propose to make to the Bill.  

The first one, we propose that in clause 55, on page 37, immediately before paragraph (a), insert the following words in clause 1: “and whose office shall be a public office”. The justification is that this provision undermines the independence and autonomy of the Office of the Auditor-General as it puts the staff under the control of the public service. The office should be similar to the IGG in terms of functional independence. We propose that those words be deleted from the Constitution.

Secondly, we propose that immediately after the proposed clause 15 of Article 163 in the Bill, insert the following new clause 16 to read: “Parliament shall make laws to regulate and facilitate the performance of the functions of the Auditor-General”.  

The justification is that the office of the Auditor-General is very important to Parliament and its establishment, as an independent authority by Parliament is necessary to enhance its status and authority. Some countries have actually established audit commissions. We are proposing that this provision be inserted to take care of the deletion referred to in the first instance and give Parliament the powers to make this a more substantial office. I beg to move.

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, the Government accepts the committee’s amendments.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, we have a small procedural problem. I think we should suspend the Committee Stage.

MOTION FOR THE HOUSE TO RESUME

10.48
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Adolf Mwesige): Madam Chairperson, I beg to move that the House do resume and the Committee of the Whole House reports thereto.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I put the question that the House do resume and the Committee of the Whole House reports thereto.

(Question put and agreed to.)

(The House resumed, the Deputy Speaker presiding.)

REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE

10.49
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JUSTICE CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Adolf Mwesige): Madam Speaker, I beg to report that the Committee of the Whole House has considered clause 55 but made no decision. I beg to report.

MOTION FOR ADOPTION OF THE 
REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Adolf Mwesigye): Madam Speaker, I beg to move that the report of the Committee of the Whole House be adopted.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I put the question that the report from the Committee of the whole House be adopted.

 (Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I will adjust the Order Paper to permit the Minister of State For Finance, Planning to make a statement. 

MINISTERIAL STATEMENT

11.11
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING (Mr Isaac Musumba): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. Honourable members, on Monday, 18 July 2005 His Excellency the President will be launching the NEPAD E-School Programme at Bugulumbya Secondary School in Kamuli.

MR AMURIAT: Madam Speaker, I understand the statement being made by the minister, according to our Rules of Procedure, is subject to debate. Unfortunately it appears that unless you are exceptional, the statement has not been circulated. I believe it would be procedurally right for members of this House to have a copy of that statement to enable them participate in the debate.  I wish to beg you guidance.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I have read the text of what the minister is presenting. It is actually an invitation. He is only inviting you to attend the function; it is not a ministerial statement as such. 

MR MUSUMBA: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. On Monday, 18 July 2005, His Excellency the President of the Republic of Uganda is going to launch an E-School Demonstration under NEPAD, at Bugulumbya Secondary School in Kamuli at 10.00 a.m. 

A little background to this is that NEPAD, which is a vision and a strategic framework for Africa’s renewal, is working with the Government of the Republic of Uganda to ensure that rural secondary schools in Africa get an opportunity to be availed with computers with internet facilities so that children that graduate from secondary schools are part of the digital age and are aware of what advantage are offered by being literate.

The NEPAD E-Schools Initiative is a functional undertaking by NEPAD aimed at ensuring that African youth who graduate from primary and secondary schools come out with skills that will enable them to function effectively in the information society and knowledge economy. The NEPAD E-Schools Initiative will make a substantial contribution towards improving the provision of education and health care on the continent by introducing appropriate ICTs, providing training and appropriate digital content to all Africa schools.

As a first stage, the NEPAD E-School Demonstration is being undertaken. It is intended that a total of 120 schools in twenty countries, including six schools from Uganda, will be converted into a fully-fledged NEPAD E-School within one year. The demonstration is being considered as a continental learning platform on which the model for deployment of the broader NEPAD E-School Initiative will be based.

In Uganda the following six schools will become E-Schools within the one year starting on Monday, 18 July 2005:  Bugulumbya Secondary School in Kamuli, Bukwiya Secondary School in Mubende District, Kabale Secondary School in Kabale District, Kyambogo College School in Kampala District, Masaka Secondary School in Masaka district and St Andrew Kaggwa secondary school, Luwero district.

There are six schools in Uganda, six schools in Ghana and six schools in Ethiopia. There will be six schools in every country in Africa that subscribe to this programme.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am inviting the honourable members to be with the President at this international event when the schools are being launched. I thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Time and date?

MR MUSUMBA: It is 10.00 a.m. on Monday, 18 July 2005 at Bugulumbya, Kamuli District. I thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think, honourable minister, that you should give directions.

MR MUSUMBA: Bugulumbya is a rural school that lies on Jinja-Kamuli road off a place called Kasambira. So when you go to Jinja, it is in Buzaaya County. But let me hasten to add that these schools - I want to be on record in the Hansard that these schools were sent by the Ministry of Education. I, Musumba, had nothing to do with the selection of the schools. I thank you.

11.15
MR PATRICK AMURIAT (Kumi County, Kumi): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I wish to thank the hon. Minister of Finance. I know that much as the statement was meant to be an invitation, it raises certain issues that I would like answers to.  

Number one issue is to observe that this is a very good programme because there is no way during this communication age we can afford to exist without ICT. Therefore, I would like to salute the Government for embracing this initiative so that our children in schools can benefit from information.  

However, I would like to observe that much of the problems that this country is faced with in promotion of ICT especially in schools are to do with he issue of lack of infrastructure. The computers by themselves cannot work unless we have power to run these computers. I am aware now that the much fancied rural electrification seems to have come to a grinding halt. I would like to imagine that unless our secondary schools –(Interruptions)

MR WERIKHE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to thank my colleague for giving way.  I have just heard my colleague saying the rural electrification programme has come to a halt. That is not true. Recently we got Shs 20 billion. It is enshrined in our budget, which is going to facilitate the process of completing the rural electrification projects that were started on for taking power to district headquarters that have not got power. So it is not correct to say that the rural electrification programme has come to a halt.

MR ERESU: The honourable minister has just assured the country that money is available. We have been looking for records. Can the minister clarify whether Katine – Kaberamaido rural electrification programme is on, or that money is going to be used to make sure that those people also get electricity?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, let us not go into the details because soon I will ask whether the other village near my home is also getting power. He has said that he has received money and he is now going to pursue the programme of electrification. But you can approach the minister, I will allow you to cross the front and talk to him. 

MR AMURIAT: Thank you very much, honourable minister for that information. I am glad that power is now going to get to the sub-county or district headquarters via Katesi. I am also aware that our schools are scattered all over the country and they are not concentrated only in urban centres or civic centres. As we talk about E-commerce, E-schools and E-Government, we really need to talk about the basic infrastructure. 

I know there is a programme under the Uganda Communications Commission that is having trouble to take off because we lack the necessary infrastructure. So whereas this programme is good, there is a need for us to look beyond this programme and to consider that the value of this programme will be derived only after we are able to spread out to the other schools. 

I know the six identified schools are few and he has just informed the House that he as hon. Isaac Musumba did not have a hand in the selection of these schools. But just looking at the list quickly, you will notice that Kamuli, Mubende, Kabale, Luweero, Masaka, Kyambogo, which is in Kampala, actually it is concentrated. There is a pattern that you see when you look at these schools that are considered. 

I would have loved to hear a Layibi somewhere, Mvara somewhere, for us to cover the traditional four or five areas of this country. It is pointless for us to concentrate knowledge on one section of the country and leave the other parts of the country in darkness. So my appeal to government is for you to revisit this list. I would like to observe that ICT is something that is catching up with the central region of the country. Most schools in Masaka, Kampala and the surrounding areas, even nursery school going children have access to computer and they are beginning to learn at that tender age. The other parts of the country that are relatively far from the centre are greatly disadvantaged and I think this must be considered. Otherwise, the programme is good and I believe if I am able to get some little bit of fuel, I will come down to Kamuli on Monday to be part of this celebration.  

As a matter of fact, being a person who has got interest in the subject and being the Chairman of the Committee on Science and Technology, it is important that I follow events going on in this country in as far as development of ITC is concerned. I thank you very much, Madam Speaker.

11.24
MS JALIA BINTU (Woman Representative, Masindi): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. As the minister was talking I was eagerly waiting to hear a Kabalega or Masindi senior secondary school on the list. It is unfortunate that the whole of Bunyoro was not included among the six schools. I am, therefore, asking the minister, what criterion was used in selecting the six schools? As you were briefing us we were eagerly waiting to hear of at least one school in the region so that we feel that it is well distributed.  

Secondly, when does the Government intend to introduce IT in almost all the secondary schools in Uganda especially in those districts that are far from the city? We know that most of our students when they finish senior six and they join the higher institutions of learning that is when they get their first chance to access the computers. When does the Government intend to introduce IT in all secondary and tertiary schools? Thank you, Madam.  

11.25
MR MADADA SULAIMAN (Bbale County, Kayunga): Madam Speaker, needless to mention is that this is a very good project for our secondary schools. We are also aware that we have limited opportunity but for political accountability, one would be interested to know the criterion not that we want all of us to have, but as you know when we go back to our constituencies we will be asked, “Why not in Bbale and why in Bugulumbya?” For purposes of information the Ministry of Education should come out with the criteria for the selection for us to be able to explain to our constituents. Thank you.

11.26
PROF. EPHRAIM KAMUNTU (Sheema County, Bushenyi): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. We must thank the minister for his statement, and purely from an incremental analysis viewpoint, any additional effort to extend rural electrification is appreciated. It does not matter how little, whatever little that is additional, we should thank you Mr Minister because hardly six percent of Uganda’s population has access to electricity. If the vision of the country is to transform the economy from peasant to commercial and an industrialised one, this vision can never happen when 90 percent of your population rises with the sun and goes to bed at sunset. 

The minister the other day was complaining about the population increase but can’t you see the reason? At sunset people go to bed and they stay in bed until sunrise while the rest of the world is working in shifts.  

Secondly, I want to talk about productivity, which is the message in the Budget Speech. The message of the Minister of Finance’s in his Budget Speech is that you will increase productivity and efficiency. You can never increase productivity substantially when you are depending on a hand hoe. There is no way you can modernize the economy when your agro-based industrialization strategy depends on electricity. It cannot happen when the skill development of your children in school is still dependent on blackboard and chalk.  

How can you train students to be skilful in industrialization information technologies when the entire 90 percent of your student population is completely innocent of any sophistication? They absolutely do not know – well, I did not want to use the word ignorant because the word ignorant is very un-diplomatic. I am saying they are innocent of any knowledge about information in education and technology. So my point is that Parliament should appreciate whatever effort you put in and encourage you to do more.

11.28
MR JOHN ERESU (Kaberamaido County, Kaberamaido): Madam Chairperson, I would like to congratulate the people of Buzaaya County for being the first people to have the launch of Information Technology (IT). I have developed a special affinity for the Basoga people since Monday. On Monday I had a motor accident in Busoga in a place called Namutumba when my vehicle went off the road. I missed a bridge, which I would have fallen into and gone into a rice field. I was very much assisted by the people of the area, particularly one boda boda man called Isiko Abdallah. This man is the kindest of the kindest people I have met in my life.  

But suffice it to say that while we install and introduce IT training to our children, what is the greater focus of IT training? Does the Ministry of Education in this country have it as a policy to make sure that all schools in Uganda at one point in time - he should tell us in no uncertain terms when that period will be when all the schools in Uganda will have facilities for IT training.  

Secondly, the Minister for Planning and Investment should also tell us what plans are in place in the transformation of our economy, especially manpower planning. How much are they planning and what do they intend to do with the output from this kind of training facilities? There is no need to carry the President to a location and give him the impression that now we are doing wonderful things when the training is done and these people do not get absorbed into the economy because this is money being lost; this manpower is being misdirected. 

So, while I congratulate the people of Buzaaya, the minister who comes from Buzaaya should take it that it is a challenge upon him to plan for the whole country.

MR BAGALANA: Thank you, Madam Chairperson. I have listened to hon. Eresu very attentively. Is it in order for hon. Eresu to cause mob justice for Buzaaya as if it is the only school or constituency, which has benefited from this project?  

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, Buzaaya is part of Uganda and they are entitled occasionally to get the first bite of the small cake. So, all we can do is to urge the minister to expedite the project to Kaberamaido and other places.

MR ERESU: I started by saying I have developed a special affinity for the Basoga, meaning that I love them so much for having saved my life. So there is nothing like mob justice.

In conclusion, I would like to say that while we launch such projects it is very important that we create in our minds, also in our vision as leaders of this country, a bigger picture to plan beyond the projects so that these projects get absorbed into the nation and the nation can benefit in terms of creating greater productivity as has already been indicated by hon. Prof. Kamuntu. I thank you.

11.31
MR JOSEPH MUGAMBE (Nakifuma County, Mukono): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I will also start off by thanking the minister for inviting us for the launch, but I will need some clarification from the minister.  

NEPAD is a programme under the Ministry of Finance. I wonder why it is the Ministry of Education that chose these six schools whereas the programme is under the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development.

I would also like to inform my colleagues that there are very many programmes addressing the issues of IT. For example, there is School-Net covering several schools here in Uganda. There is also another programme with UTL, they have got codeless phones and any school can access E-commerce or become an E-school under that programme. So maybe we are not aware of that.  

Honourable members, under the NEPAD programme there is a NEPAD desk in the Parliament of Uganda. Maybe we should ask that desk to inform us more about this programme because there are so many things that are going on, but we are not well informed about this very crucial programme. 

Under the National Objectives of our Constitution, chapter 14, we are given the principles and directions. But what I want to point out is that most of the programmes in the schools go to government-aided schools and ignore those schools, which are privately owned. Whereas these children in the private schools are also entitled to such services, my prayer is that private schools should also be considered. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

11.34
MR JACOB OULANYAH (Omoro County, Gulu): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I am just imagining how President Museveni is going to launch the programme. I am trying to remember President Museveni as a nationalist who cares for the whole of this country. I am just wondering how he is going to read three schools in the central region, one school in the Eastern region, another one in the West and the whole of the West Nile, Acholi, Lango, Teso, Karamoja none. I am just wondering how he is going to feel when he read these names.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Honourable minister, I think the issues being raised are basically the same. How were they selected? What is the role of the Ministry of Education, if you could, please quickly tell us so that we can move on to other business.

11.35
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING (Mr Isaac Musumba): Madam speaker, I think the honourable members have made their contribution to this subject. What has come out consistently is: what criteria were used to pick the six schools upon which a demonstration is going to be made? 

When I went to attend the NEPAD in South Africa –(Interruption)

MRS MUKWAYA: Madam Speaker, I am just seeking a clarification from my colleague. With these rational suggestions and proposals from our members, is it too late to withdraw and we reorganise as government so that we launch the initial schools as planned?

MR MUSUMBA: Madam Speaker, I will have to react to hon. Mukwaya’s clarification. First all, the launch in Bugulumbya is so advanced; it will be taking place on Monday. People have come from the headquarters of NEPAD School project from South Africa; the people of HP have come from America, they are all here and ready to go.  

However, if the Parliament wants to have a look at the other schools, I do not see why we cannot do that. It can be submitted to them again, but these schools have been already submitted to those people in South Africa. Parliament can have a look at them; I have no objection.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable minister, hon. Mukwaya suggested that let us go ahead with Bugulumbya because that one is already agreed upon, and we defer the others. 

MR MUSUMBA: I concede, Madam Speaker.  

BILLS
COMMITTEE STAGE

THE CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT NO. 3) BILL, 2005

Clause 55

11.39
THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, in clause 55 an amendment had been moved to delete, and the Government had conceded –(Interruption)

MR OULANYAH: The deletion is not of the clause in the Bill.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: It is a part of it?

MR OULANYAH: The Constitution.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Okay.

MR OULANYAH: The first amendment is to delete some phrase in the Constitution and then the next one is to insert in the Bill.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: The one for the deletion, which is a part in the Constitution, requires a roll call. Honourable members, I hope you have the report of the committee and their proposal. So I would like to put the question to the first –(Interruption)

MAJ. (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: Madam Chairperson, before the question is put I would like to make a comment that whereas the amendment by the committee is fair, in my view it is not adequate. Studies were carried out for improving accountability in the Government of Uganda and several countries that are known for accounting were studied and the report was made. 

The office of the Auditor-General is an office of Parliament, in fact he has nothing to do with the Executive as far as accountability is concerned; he is supposed to report to Parliament. Let me read a paragraph from one of the model countries. They said, “The Auditor General is an office of Parliament and in that capacity is independent of Executive Government and answerable to Parliament”.  

New Zealand, which is a model that was studied, Parliament is supreme and all authority of Government activity ultimately stems from Parliament. Public sector organizations are therefore accountable to Parliament for their use of public resources and powers that it has conferred on them. Madam Chairperson, in my view the office of the Auditor-General should be part of Parliament and he should have term limits like in other countries.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable member, are you moving an amendment or what?

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Madam Chairperson, whereas I agree that the amendment of the committee is fair, in my view it is not very adequate. I move to recommit this Article.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: No, you cannot recommit it because we have not voted on it; that is where we are now. 

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Madam Chairperson, I have just been advised that we should make it law, so I agree.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Now what amendment would you like to make? The committee proposed that certain words should be deleted. I do not know whether that is the part you would like to amend?

MS KIRASO: Hon. Rwamirama wants to know whether he can move an amendment or disagree with the committee. My problem is with the amendment of this clause. In as far as the proposed (c) is concerned, it reads, “… in consultation with Public Service Commission, employ and discipline his or her own staff.”  

I would like to urge Parliament to delete this (c), reason being that we are creating an independent and autonomous Auditor-General’s office. If you look at the Auditor General’s – I think we passed an Act, which gives more powers and independence to the Auditor-General. If you start mixing the Auditor-General’s function with Public Service Commission, then the Auditor-General will not be in charge of the people that he is employing. We wanted the Auditor-General to be independent, to have the powers to hire and fire and that is what independence is all about.  

So, I do not know whether this is what hon. Rwamirama was talking about. The deletion of (c) would emphasise the independence of the Auditor-General in the way we have always intended it to be.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Hon. Kiraso, may I know whether you presented your proposal to the committee and it was rejected?

MS KIRASO: The proposal of the committee was to delete.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: No, the proposal of the committee is to delete part of Article 153(1). You have moved to sub-clause (c) and you are asking for a deletion. So I am asking, did you have an opportunity to discuss this with the committee and what was their view?

MS KIRASO: No, I did not but I am begging your indulgence, Madam Chairperson, that the House considers this a very genuine case. A precedent has already been set where people are moving amendments and proposing deletions on the Floor of the House.

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Further clarification, Madam Chairperson?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: No, honourable members, let us proceed in an orderly manner. Which clause are you addressing, hon. Epak?

DR OKULO EPAK: Madam Chairperson, I was trying to intercede in support of hon. Kiraso’s proposal to delete this paragraph. The spirit of this paragraph is not in consonance with the spirit of the amendment being brought by the committee. The committee’s amendment is to strengthen and ensure the independence of the office of the Auditor-General. So it may have been a slight omission on our part not to make this submission to the committee. It is correct to delete this provision because the office of the IGG is not required to do this sort of thing. We are trying to establish the office of the Auditor-General, which should even be better and stronger than the office of the IGG. Therefore, this is not necessary.

Secondly, in fact those of us who wanted to move, actually we wanted to establish an audit commission and it is only through humility that we have stopped at moving that far. But in many cases you will actually require an audit commission, which will be far stronger. And in comparison with Teaching Service Commission and the Judicial Service Commission, they are not obliged to consult with the Public Service Commission. I would like to beg your indulgence to allow this motion to delete this paragraph. I thank you.

MR OTAFIIRE: Madam Chairperson, we are amending the Constitution and any amendment that is being brought now without the minister and the chairperson of the committee studying and reconciling it with the rest of the Constitution is likely to cause confusion, clash with the entrenched clauses and contradict other clauses in the Constitution. So, I propose that all the amendments concerning the Constitution be brought and reconciled with the rest of the Constitution for Parliament to be able to take decision on them and then pass them. Thank you very much.

PROF. KAMUNTU: The clarification I am seeking is that Article 163 of the Constitution establishes the office of the Auditor-General. What is being proposed in the amendment is to insert immediately after clause 3(b), which reads: “Conduct financial and value for money audits in respect of any project involving public funds.”  After that, what is being proposed is that –(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: What are you reading?

PROF. KAMUNTU: I am just responding to a clarification that what is being debated is not really bringing new amendments. It is a debate whether or not we should insert that the Public Service Commission should be consulted when employing and disciplining some of the Auditor-General’s staff. The point we are putting across is that we should not allow the Auditor-General to consult Public Service commission when employing his staff. 

MS KIRASO:  Madam Chairperson, I rise on a point of order. The hon. Kahinda Otafiire has just raised a very pertinent issue on this important matter and immediately he raised it he walked out of the House before we resolved the matter. Is he in order?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: No, I have no idea where he is.

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, first of all, the chairperson has already guided this House that for amendments that were not moved in the committee, it is not proper to introduce these amendments in this Committee of the whole House. The rationale is very clear because we are amending the Constitution and it will not be proper for Government and even the committee to be ambushed with amendments that have not been studied. That is point No. 1.

Point No. 2, it is not true that other independent bodies like the IGG do not consult the Public Service Commission. If one reads –(Interjections)- well, I am giving you information, if you could wait a minute. In the Inspector General of Government Act, the Inspector General of Government appoints staff in consultation with the Public Service Commission.  

The Human Rights Commission, which is an independent commission under Article 57, I would like to read it: “The appointment of the officers and other employees of the Commission shall be made by the Commission in consultation with the Public Service Commission.” 

Under the Electoral Commission Act, the Electoral Commission appoints the Secretary to the Commission and the staff of the commission in consultation with the Public Service Commission. Why do these independent bodies have to consult the Public Service Commission? The answer is simple. The Public Service Commission is possessed with the expertise and knowledge enough to advise these commissions on the terms of service, conditions of service and on recruitment in general. Consultation in these cases is not mandatory. The commission responsible for recruitment can take the advice or ignore the advice of the Public Service Commission. But it is important that in the recruitment of staff the input of the Public Service Commission is sourced. That is the information I thought I should give.

MRS MUKWAYA: I think the Ssempebwa Commission Report should guide us. The Auditor-General submitted - if you read his submission it is the concerns of the Auditor-General that the Government captured. Actually in this whole process the Auditor-General has been consulted on the issue as presented in the Bill.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Okay, honourable members, we may run the danger of making amendments the effect of which may be contradictory within the Constitution. What I would propose is that if hon. Kiraso and hon. Epak are very strongly of the view that we should really follow up this matter, we can give you time to consult with the committee and the minister and then you come back at recommital stage because we would have had time to look it.

MS KIRASO: Much obliged. I agree with your ruling that we synchronize this amendment with what the committee was proposing. So we can stand it over and consult with the committee.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Okay, honourable members, let us go back to clause 1. We were about to vote on the proposal by the committee that the last part, which reads, “shall be a public officer”, be deleted. I put the question to it 

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, this is the outcome of the vote: one abstention, none against, and those for are 98. The ayes have it

(Question agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: And there is another amendment to insert, chairperson.

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chairperson, we propose that immediately after the proposed clause 15 of Article 163 we insert the following new clause 16, which reads, “Parliament shall make laws to regulate and facilitate the performance of functions of the Auditor General.”

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chair, I accept the committee’s amendment.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, let us vote on the new clause 16. I put the question to it. 

(Question put.)
 
(The Members voted by a show of hands)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Okay, honourable members, there have been no abstentions, none against, and those for are 105.
 
(Question agreed to.)

MS NAMUSOKE: Madam Chairperson, I am seeking clarification whether –(Interruption)- let me say what I want to say and then you will guide me. I want to propose that the amendment (b) which says, “by inserting immediately after clause (8) the following - that part which says, “The Auditor-General may retire” should be moved. It should come after 10, which talks about vacating of the office of the Auditor-General because this Article also seems to be talking about vacation of the office of the Auditor-General, which is more related to clause 10 of the Constitution. It is just moving that clause from appearing immediately after clause 8 and it appears after clause 10.  

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Hon. Namusoke Sarah, I am looking at the Constitution, sub-clause (8) is salary and allowances.

MS NAMUSOKE: Madam Chairperson, I am saying that sub-clause (8) indeed is about the salaries and allowances payable but the amendment that is being proposed to become (b) in 55 is about vacation of office and in the Constitution vacation of office appears in clause 10.  

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: What the honourable member wants is that sub-clause 55(8)(a) should be moved to fall under 10 so that it should be, “Removal either by retirement or by the President”.  Is that what you want?

MS NAMUSOKE: Yes, Madam Chairperson.

MRS MWESIGYE: Thank you, Madam Chairperson. What hon. Sarah Kiyingi is doing is for the draft persons who will re-organise the principles that we would have passed. If we go into drafting in this Parliament I do not think we shall go very far.  I need your guidance on that.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I think we can note the proposal so that when the Constitution is being re-aligned it will be done consequentially. We have noted your proposal and the minister should take it into account.

PROF. KAMUNTU: Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. Article 163 and the amendment (b) impose an age limit on the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General may retire after attaining the age of 60 and is mandatorily required to retire when they attain the age of 70.

I am asking for clarification, how consistent is this age limit throughout the Constitution for offices, which are as independent as the Auditor-General? Does the Governor Bank of Uganda or the IGG or even the Judges of the High Court have it? Can you even put an age limit on a minister? If by imposing an age limit means as he or she is reaching a certain age his or her thinking capacity begins to decline then those who hold high offices – this rule must apply across board. I need clarification on this point.

MRS MUKWAYA: I want to be clarified by my colleague whether our former Chief Justice was what he is suggesting by the time he retired? You can keep your brains even at 90.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: What the honourable member is asking is whether this age between 60 and 70 is consistent with other offices: the Judges, the President, is it consistent with other institutions?

MRS MUKWAYA: Madam Chairperson, if I can use my institutional memory, we consulted and we were told by the Public Service that this is a particular caliber of person and it is very difficult to find that person. So in order to build an institution you need to keep them long enough to build other people to take over.

MR KAKOOZA: On the same issue, at least for an Auditor General I feel at 70 the workload, which is there, the reports and what you need to scrutinise using computerised accounting! You find that they cannot make it to the required standard. There are so many people coming up in these fields so I feel that the age of 60 can be –(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: So you are saying that 70 is too far?

MR LWANGA: Thank you, Madam Chairperson. You are talking about accountants and it takes a minimum of about ten years to make an accountant. So most people who have just left the university at the age of 23 will really become qualified accountants at about 33, which is ten years later. Once qualified, they can work for another 40 years. Why? Because we have got what we call continuous professional education, which is annual, so that every year they are up to date. But as they work they gain experience and this is not experience, which you can throw away at 60. So, most accountants should be able to work until the age of 70, even beyond.

But being an Auditor-General means that they are fairly very busy people and at 70 I think they will have done their bit. It is not true that at 70 one cannot scrutinise figures if he is well trained. I am almost 60 and I think I can work for another ten years. Thank you.

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, under Article 144(1) judicial officers retire on attaining the age of 60 but vacate office in the case of the Chief Justice, Deputy Chief Justice, Justices of the Supreme Court and Justices of Appeal on attaining the age of 70 years. So the analogy has examples elsewhere in the Public Service.  

MR ETONU: Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson.  I would like to be clarified particularly by the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs who said it is very rare to get Auditor-Generals so they could continue. I thought the Auditor-General also has deputies and commissioners below him or her who could be able to take up the post in case he or she is not there?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I think the question hon. Kamuntu had asked is whether this age of 70 is consistent with other organs of the state and the minister has just said that it is the same with the Judges and others.

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: Madam Chairperson, I just want to say that there is that consistency, which the Minister of Justice has pointed out, but in future I would like to suggest an amendment that in the case of the learned people, the older, the wiser.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I put the question that clause 55 do stand part of the Bill. We shall take a roll call.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, this is the outcome of the vote: there are no abstentions, none against, and those for are 141.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 55 agreed to.

Clause 56

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chairperson, clause 56 proposes to amend Article 165, on the Public Service Commission. We examined this proposal and we recommend that the whole clause be deleted. The amendment is not necessary at this time.  

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, the Government accepts the committee’s amendment.

MS KIRASO: We have been complaining about the expenditure on public administration. What if the Government wanted to cure this by reducing on the number of the commissioners? This one prescribes the number, seven, on top of the chairperson and the vice-chairperson. What if government’s intention was to quickly address this problem of expenditure on public administration? I just want to be clarified on that.

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, that was exactly the policy behind this amendment, and in fact other amendments. There are many amendments of that kind in this Bill but you recognise that our roadmap is tight. If we had to address all these amendments we would take longer than we anticipate this constitutional process to take. That is why in the interest of time - and I think this is the reason the committee gave in proposing that this amendment be deferred to the Eighth Parliament for consideration - in the interest of time we accept the committee’s recommendation that we defer the amendment of this clause, but I understand the reasons my colleague is giving.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, the question is that clause 56 be deleted. 

(Question put)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, there are no abstentions; two voted against and 98 are for the deletion.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 56 deleted.

Clause 57

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chairperson, the committee proposes deletion of clause 57 for the same reasons that were used in clause 56.

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, the Government accepts the committee’s recommendation.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, the question is that clause 57 be deleted.

(Question put)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: The results are as follows: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 97. The ayes have it. 

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 57 deleted.

Clause 58

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chairperson, clause 58 proposes an amendment to Article 167, on the Education Service Commission. We propose a deletion of this clause for the same reasons as advanced before.

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, the Government accepts the committee’s recommendation. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Okay, the question is that clause 58 be deleted.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: The results are as follows: no abstentions, those against are two, and those for are 99. The ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 58 deleted.

Clause 59

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chairperson, clause 59 proposes to amend Article 168 to introduce new functions to the Education Service Commission. The functions so proposed could actually be contained in an Act of Parliament. The committee thinks this amendment is not necessary at this stage at all and the clause should be deleted. 

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, the Government accepts the committee’s recommendation. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, the question is that clause 59 be deleted.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Okay, the results are as follows: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 97. The ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 59 deleted.

Clause 60

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chairperson, clause 60 proposes to amend Article 169, on the Health Service Commission. The same reasons we advanced earlier apply to this. We propose the deletion of this clause. 

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, the Government accepts the committee’s recommendation. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, the question is that clause 60 be deleted. 

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: The results are as follows: no abstentions, those against are four, and those for are 98. The ayes have it. 

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 60 deleted.

Clause 61

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chairperson, clause 61 proposes to amend Article 170, introducing new functions for the Health Service Commission. The committee thinks that these functions could be contained in an Act of Parliament. The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary and we propose a deletion.

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, the Government accepts the Committee’s recommendation. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, the question is that clause 61 be deleted.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: The results are as follows: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 97. The ayes have it. 

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 61 deleted.

Clause 62

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chairperson, clause 62 proposes to insert a new clause 173(a) to provide for the office of the head of Public Service. The committee had previously considered that this clause is unnecessary and should be deleted, but it was reconsidered and the view now is that it is an act of validation because that office exists as of now, just like the office of the Prime Minister, so it would be necessary to amend it now.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Any comments? Mr Minister, do you have no problem?

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, I would like to thank the committee for accepting this amendment and to move that you put the question.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, I put the question that clause 6 do stand part of the Bill. We shall use the roll call.

Clause 62 agreed to.

MR WAGONDA MUGULI: Madam Chairperson, I notice that while we have just passed the provision for the head of the Public Service and we are yet to consider a provision for PS. There is an existing rank of deputy head of Public Service, which is not provided for. At an appropriate time I will move a motion to recommit this particular clause to provide for the post of deputy head of Public Service.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: We have noted your intention to recommit this clause to introduce a deputy head of the Public Service. 

Clause 63

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chairperson, clause 63 proposes to amend Article 174. The proposal in the Bill is not better than the formulation in the Constitution. We move that this clause be deleted so that the formulation in the Constitution remains. I beg to move.

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, the Government accepts the committee’s recommendation.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, the question is that clause 63 be deleted.

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Adolf Mwesige): Madam Chairperson, I beg to move that the House do resume and the Committee of the Whole House reports thereto.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I put the question that the House do resume and the Committee of the Whole House reports thereto.

(Question put and agreed to.)

REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE

1.44
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Adolf Mwesige): Madam Speaker, I beg to report that the Committee of the Whole House has considered and adopted clause 55; deleted clauses 56, 57,58, 59, 60 and 61; adopted clause 62; deleted clause 63, and adopted clause 64. I beg to report.

MOTION FOR ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE WHOLE HOUSE 

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Adolf Mwesige): Madam Speaker, I beg to move that the Report of the Committee of the Whole House be adopted.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I put the question that the report of the Committee of the Whole House be adopted.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, you need to go and have lunch. The House is suspended until 2.45 p.m. 

(The House was suspended at 1.40 p.m.)

(On resumption at 3.07 p.m._)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you back from the lunch break.  

3.08
MS SARAH NAMUSOKE (Woman Representative, Rakai): Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter of national importance. Last week our newspapers presented a report from the World Health Organisation, where we had been ranked as the No. 1 nation in consuming alcohol. In fact some of the radio presenters even turned it into a joke and said, “At least Uganda has become No. 1 at something”. I do not know whether that is something to be proud of. 

I am sure we all know that after 6.00 p.m. we witness cars parked along the roadside in the suburbs of this country. The owners of those cars are usually seated in bufundas consuming alcohol. Bufundas are small joints, so I hear - I do not go to these places so I do not know the latest terms used to describe them. Those cars are parked there until late in the night and for all this time people are consuming alcohol. Therefore, it is no wonder that we have been recorded as having gone so far. 

The reason I rise here is that it is also no wonder that they are also corresponding reports of violence against women and children. Madam Speaker, would the male colleagues allow me to complete my submission? 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, permit hon. Kiyingi to complete her statement.

MS NAMUSOKE: Many children who attend day schools in this city suffer a lot with their drunken parents. They keep them in those cars for hours, sleeping and turning in those cars while their parents sit in the bufundas mentioned. I think this is a report we should take seriously as individuals and as a nation. If any of us or any Ugandan is a participant in this dangerous habit, they should urgently seek help. If we continue at this rate we all risk destruction by this consumption of alcohol. The consequence is violence against innocent people.  

3.11
MR ALINTUMA NSAMBU (Bukoto County East, Masaka): Madam Speaker, realistically speaking, if we were not able to ban the Red Pepper and other types of pornography, how easy is it to tell people to stop consuming alcohol? Other frightening examples are entujjo, or big functions where crowds are gathered in stadiums. These consume alcohol using glass bottles. I always fear for what might happen in case a time bomb was to explode in such a place where nearly everybody is drunk. What Parliament could do as a way of controlling the consumption of alcohol is to ban the use of bottles in such gatherings. If someone is already drunk and his neighbour is having fun with his wife, you cannot rule out the throwing of bottles. 

We need to consider the concerns raised by hon. Kiyingi with the seriousness they deserve. We should also work out means of ensuring that organisers of these big events prohibit the use of bottles for alcohol. Plastic bottles should be a better alternative for this kind of function. This way we shall have solved part of the big problem, until a later date when we get a more long lasting solution. 

3.12
MS OLIVER WONEKA (Woman Representative, Mbale): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would also like to add a word to hon. Namusoke’s concern. She mentioned how children suffer when they are left in the cars while their parents are busy drinking themselves away. Your office is launching Uganda Parliamentary Forum for Children tomorrow. This should be of great concern to this Parliament because besides what we do, we have even gone out of our way to form a forum to care about children’s affairs. We should all think seriously about the issue of leaving the children in the cars by the roadside, with all the road fumes, the hunger and the rest of the dangers they suffer -(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: And they are not doing their homework when they are sitting in the car.

MR ERESU: Madam Speaker, I would like a simple clarification. The member raising the issue on alcohol consumption should tell us what kind of alcohol she has talked about. We have ajono, enguuli and many others that are all types of alcohol. We have –(Interruption)

MS NAMAGGWA: Madam Speaker, I think my colleague is taking this matter very lightly. This is why in fact even the Prime Minister together with his ministers are not paying any attention to what we are discussing. This is a very serious issue, which Parliament has indirectly supported. I think with this so much tax on alcohol –(Interjection)- this is a preamble because as I said, it is a very important issue –(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Put your point of order and finish.

MS NAMAGGWA: Madam Speaker, is he in order to take this matter very lightly when in fact, it is very serious? Internationally this was on the BBC and all radios that Uganda was the leading consumer of alcohol. This has a very bad effect and it is coming at a time when our peasants are suffering on the road with petroleum product prices that go up and down all the time, yet the prices of alcohol are going down. 

Is he in order to take this matter very lightly instead of examining what is wrong with the tax on alcohol? I end my point of order by requesting the Prime Minister to come up with a report about what is happening, especially in terms of alcohol vis-à-vis the prices of petroleum products. I would like government to give us a report.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, hon. Kiyingi’s point is that early this week there was a report from the World Health Organisation to the effect that Ugandans had the highest capacity to consume alcohol in the whole world, and that the people who evaluated the situation were worried that we may be thinking of raising taxes rather than controlling the consumption of alcohol. So they are calling upon the Government to do something about the level of consumption.  

MR ERESU: Madam Speaker, before I was disrupted I wanted to raise the issue of the different kinds of alcohol consumed. However, what I wanted to bring as a point to be considered by the House and the Government is that in 1964 there was an Act of Parliament called the Enguuli Act. The implementation of that Act has not been seen today. That is one of the reasons why the consumption of enguuli is so effective and it is found everywhere in the countryside. 

Secondly, what the member should have brought out in support of her argument about consumption of alcohol is that since the rehabilitation of this country, since the time the NRM Government came, and the fall of Amin for that matter, there has been emphasis on the expansion of the production of alcohol in the various industries that produce alcohol. 

I do not know whether any care has been taken to reduce the risks involved in the packaging, as raised by hon. Alintuma Nsambu. These are some of the most important things we should consider, to enable government enact a law. We should make it mandatory for the manufacturers of these gins and alcohol to consider a more friendly method of packaging so that they do not become time bombs as it has been stated.

Finally, we should note that consumption of alcohol is because of social problems. One of the social problems in this country is the so much time that people spend idle and unproductive. Therefore, we must also consider how to make the people of this country more productive so that they do not spend all their time idle and consuming alcohol.
  
THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I would like to ask one of the medical people to speak on this, and then Dr Esele.  Before the two members come up, please join me in welcoming students from Nansana Secondary School, Wakiso. They are in the gallery. You are very welcome. (Applause)

3.18
DR STEVEN MALLINGA (Butebo County, Pallisa): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. Alcohol is a disease as defined by the World Health Organisation, which means there is an epidemic in this country. If one consumes more than two pints of beer, that person is a patient, according to the World Health Organisation. (Laughter) If one consumes six ounces of hard liquor, that person is sick, just as one who consumes more than two glasses of wine. I hear my friends talk about alcoholism, but we are not providing the solution. We have to stop the brewing of waragi and the entire native brews. That is No. 1.

Number two; we have to raise the taxes on alcohol to such an extent that we control the consumption. I was disappointed that the taxes on alcohol were not raised in the last budget. Why should we allow people to drink as much as they want and then spend money on public media educating them about the dangers of alcohol? Alcoholism is a disease, which affects almost everybody in the society. Those who drink have often caused accidents and killed other people. The children suffer, as the honourable member has already outlined, and some parents end up drinking all the money meant for school fees. Children drop out of school as a result and teenagers become alcoholic.  

This is a serious matter, which needs serious consideration. We must come up with a policy but in the meantime we must raise the prices of alcohol to reduce the consumption.

3.20
DR JOHN ESELE (Bukedea County, Kumi): Madam Speaker, I thank you. While I am concerned about the children’s suffering, I am also concerned about poverty among our people especially in the rural areas where the only source of income is agriculture. Recently Nile Breweries picked up a variety of sorghum called epuripuri and turned it into beer. In Teso and Lango epuripuri sorghum is now a cash crop. They are now fighting poverty through the production of this cash crop. For how long must our people stay poor?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: May I ask the Minister of Ethics and Integrity to comment about alcohol.

3.21
THE MINISTER OF STATE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY (Mr Tim Lwanga): Thank you, Madam Speaker. It is difficult to talk about a subject in which one is not physically involved. Having listened to the members’ concerns, my view is that government should be given time to study the problem of alcohol in this country, with a view to regulating drinking hours. We shall also review, strengthen and enforce the laws to make sure the situation improves.  

3.22
MR ALEX NDEEZI (Representative of Persons with Disabilities, Central): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. In Uganda it is only Kyambogo University that offers diploma and degree courses related to disability. One month ago I received a report to the effect that the Government had decided to terminate sponsorship of these courses. I undertook research and established that either the courses had been terminated or the sponsorship level reduced.

The students doing the diploma in Special Needs in 2005/06 are ten, yet in 2004/05 they were 23. There is none undertaking the diploma in Community Based Education, in 2005/06 yet in 2004/05 they were five. The diploma in Mobility Rehabilitation of Disability and Impairment has only a few students; the diploma in Sign Language ten students were undertaking it in 2004/05 but there is none for 2005/06. The degree in Special Needs Education had 20 students in 2004/05 but only 13 in 2005/06.             
 
On 15 June 2005, I officially wrote to the Minister of Education to tell him of this scenario. It is now one month and I do not have a response. If he does not respond at all, I will talk. I was in Kyambogo today. I was informed that this matter could not be pursued any further if we do not handle it by the end of this month. My people are deeply worried and undergoing so much stress. There are lots of complaints especially when we know very well that this government has been praised for doing a very big job in as far as empowerment of the poor is concerned.  

May I request the leader of Government Business to give an explanation to this House and to –(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Leader of Government Business, the problem hon. Ndeezi is raising concerns Articles 30 and 32 of the Constitution. As a country we undertook to give special attention to the disabled and other marginalised groups. I do not know whether there is any Minister from Education to tell us what is happening.

MR MWANDHA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am happy that hon. Ndeezi raised this matter, which is of great concern. As you rightly pointed out, we have not respected what is in the Constitution. For somebody in government to unilaterally decide that they are not going to sponsor students who are undertaking studies relating to providing services to disabled people, is regrettable yet the demand for the services of these trained people is so high. 

People who qualify from these institutions are not deployed because Disability Studies is a non-teaching subject and since such a teacher cannot accumulate eight hours of teaching a day, then he is regarded as redundant. Therefore, these people end up not being hired. This goes against the principle of UPE, which is supposed to be inclusive, where children who are disabled are supposed to benefit. I am happy that the Rt hon. Prime Minister will answer since he is here. 

3.28
THE PRIME MINISTER (Prof. Apolo Nsibambi): Thank you, Madam Speaker. Two important issues have been raised this afternoon. The first one concerns people drinking a lot of alcohol, which affects a number of ministries, but I think it is a health hazard. It involves the Ministry of Ethics as well, so I have no hesitation in requesting the Minister of Health to interface with the relevant ministries to come up with a policy. We need a policy - I think it will require three months. This is a weighty matter for which we have to define the quantum of the problem and the cause of the problem so we can provide immediate solutions. So -(Interruption) 

MR AMURIAT: Thank you very much Rt hon. Prime Minister for giving way. As we grapple with this issue of alcohol consumption, I would like to bring to your attention that we have another social problem and that manifests itself in the consumption of opium or bangi. In all towns all over this country it is very likely that you will get scents of bangi and many other unpleasant smells. 

Many of our young people have taken to smoking opium. I have carried out research around Kampala and found many of these berserk people running around in the streets of Kampala are mentally ill because of consuming bangi. There is something that needs to be done immediately. Otherwise, we stand the risk of losing an entire generation, especially those who are out of school.  

Even in certain schools students take bangi to their dormitories and share it amongst themselves. We are faced with a bigger social problem than mere consumption of alcohol because bangi is more tangible than alcohol. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, let the Prime Minister give us his solution. The matter is not ending today and I expect that he will have a public hearing where we shall go and give evidence.
 
PROF. NSIBAMBI: As I already said, the Minister of Health should be able to address these matters using different mechanisms, including public hearings. That is why I am saying that the minister should have three months in which to study the quantum of the problem and its causes.

Hon. Ndeezi and hon. Mwandha have raised a very important matter, I wish the Minister of Education and Sports were represented. Under these circumstances I am asking the minister to ensure that he answers these questions within a week from today because some work has to be done regarding that.

BILLS
COMMITTEE STAGE

THE CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT NO. 3) BILL, 2005

Clause 65

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Chairperson, do you have any amendment? 

MAJ. (RTD) KINOBE: Madam Chairperson, I have a slight amendment to clause 1 as it is in the Bill, which reads: “There shall be a chief administrative officer for every district.” I am moving to add, “deputy chief administrative officer” because there is an on-going restructuring exercise, which is formalising the position of a deputy chief administrative officer as a substantive post and second to that of the CAO. The appointment is not on assignment of duties by the CAO but substantively by the Public Service Commission.  

When you look at Article 188, which we are trying to amend, one of the clauses we are getting rid of is the one that used to automatically make the CAO an accounting officer. This way the Government or the Secretary to the Treasury (ST) could appoint either the chief administrative officer or any other officer as the ST may deem fit. But as per the Public Finance and Accountability Act, one of the reasons for reaching out to the town clerks is better control of officers who handle huge sums of money. In a situation where the Secretary to the Treasury does not appoint the CAO, the only likely possibility is to appoint the deputy CAO. Therefore, one of the reasons for moving that we add the deputy CAO is to reach out and here I am using the very arguments that the Government used to bring the CAO and the town clerks of cities and municipalities to the centre. I beg to move.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: What is the total formulation of your amendment?

MAJ. KINOBE: The total formulation is to insert, “There shall be a Chief Administrative Officer and a Deputy Chief Administrative Officer for every district”. The current situation is that every district now has a Deputy Chief Administrative Officer. In the on going exercise, the Deputy CAO is equivalent of a commissioner, while the CAO is equivalent to a director and these two positions are very substantive and powerful. Also they perform similar duties, therefore, the objective is to achieve the same results as those the Government is trying to achieve by bringing CAOs and town clerks to the centre. I beg to move.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Does the minister have any objections? Are you opposing it?

MR KIGYAGI: Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. I would like to oppose the amendment moved by my colleague. I appreciate his concerns but my only fear is that there is a lot of decentralization. We should get the principle of the personnel who are the chief administrative officers and move slowly from there. Also about the deputy chief administrative officer, next someone will move to have the assistant chief administrative officer. I think this is too much. While we are looking at decentralization, it should not be to the maximum. We should regulate all this. 

Therefore, I propose that the deputy CAO not be brought to the centre but stay as they are. After all if need be we can provide for regulations in the Local Government Act instead of bringing it in the principle law, which is the Constitution. It is on those grounds that I oppose the amendment.

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, we have already proposed in the Government amendments, which are being circulated to members, that the office of town clerk should also be constitutionalised and appointed by the Public Service Commission. We consider the position of deputy CAO to be an important one because when the CAO is not in office the deputy CAO will have the same powers that the CAO has. Therefore, we concede to hon. Kinobe’s amendment that  -(Applause) 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, are there any objections now that the Government -(Interruption)  

DR NKUUHE: Madam Chairperson, my concern is that much as the process of decentralization was highly successful, we are going to undermine it by our own actions. What we are doing is re-centralising and dis-empowering districts we had empowered in the process of decentralization. For this reason I would like to move that under Article 188(2), we delete that provision so that the CAOs are appointed by the districts who will have the power to discipline them. 

The reason for saying this is that you cannot give districts power with one hand and take it away with the other. Much as people are arguing that the CAOs have shown lack of accountability, corruption and so on, when you move them from the periphery where they can be seen and you appoint them from the centre, there is nobody to follow them up since they are much further from supervision. 

In theory, therefore, they may be more corrupt since nobody can tell on them. Moreover, we have officers appointed from the centre like the Police department where most of it is still centralized. However, when you carry out a corruption perception index, you find that the Police is the most corrupt yet it is appointed from the centre. Therefore, what guarantee do you have that by appointing the CAO from the centre you will reduce corruption?

PROF. KABWEGYERE: Madam Chairperson, it may be interpreted that getting the CAO appointed by the centre is re-centralisation but at the same time the reason this is happening should be understood. We have had problems of shifting, getting rid or even disciplining CAOs. I can mention five districts where we failed to control the situation. In those districts the CAO was known by the IGG, the Auditor-General and everybody, except those who were collaborating with him, that he or she was not suitable for the job. It required a council to make a resolution for the interdiction of the CAO. 

When you are sending monies, and we are going to do so in large quantities to replace graduated tax for the payment of political leaders, and you have no control over the person who is receiving and distributing this money, you have a problem. 

Let me further inform Parliament that when graduated tax existed, the collectors remained with a percentage of that money, which was able to filter to the villages and was available at the sub-county, parish, and district level. But now that all the money is coming from the centre to reach the toes so to speak, you need machinery that can ensure that the money reaches the village. 

For that reason we must have a reasonable say over the person doing the distribution. You cannot have a big banquet without knowing who is going to be in charge –(Interjection)– and you cannot have a banquet and not be in charge of the chief server. That is the logic behind this. We move forward, backward and forward again and this is normal behaviour for human beings and society. 

DR NKUUHE: The logic by hon. Kabwegyere is neither here nor there. The money you are giving to the districts is not Central Government money. Rather, it is on behalf of the Central Government that you are giving money to the people. The money actually comes from them and you are only distributing it back to them.

Secondly, there will be money going to the sub-counties. Are you going to apportion the sub-counties from the center because in theory -(Interruption)

MS KIYINGI: As soon hon. Sebunya stepped in this House, he wagged his figure furiously at me and I am suspicious that it is probably because earlier on I raised an issue about alcohol. Madam Chairperson is the honourable member in order to hold me accountable for a World Health Organization Report that said that there is a lot of alcohol consumption. Is the honourable member in order and I wish to be assured that the wagging of his figure was not in bad faith. I thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can I know from hon. Sebunya why he wagged a figure at her before I make a ruling?

MR SEBUNYA: Madam Speaker, I was only beckoning to my colleague so that we can go out and talk about something in Rakai. (Laughter)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable, I think he was attempting to assault you with a friendly weapon, so it is okay. 

MR MWANDHA: The reason why Government is making this proposal is to try and fight corruption in Local Government but to me, this is not a solution for the rampant corruption there. Government should look for another solution rather than jumping on an easy one, which may not work. If we are serious about decentralization then we must be so. We cannot take one step forward and two steps backwards. 

The Chief Administrative Officer is a key person in a district and to allow this person to be recruited, hired and remunerated by some other central authority is to undermine the very principle of decentralization. In my view, if there are weaknesses in Local Government with regard to the recruitment and management of the Chief Administrative Officer, Government should tackle this at Local Government level. This solution to bring CAOs to the centre is really retrogressive -(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable, this matter was one that was heavily debated on at the Second Reading. Therefore, what I want is for us to move as follows; we shall begin with Article 65(1) with the amendment as proposed by hon. Kinobe, which Government has accepted then we shall go to Article 65(2).

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, there were 2 abstentions, 2 members voted “No”, and 118	members voted “Aye”.

(Question agreed to.)

MAJ. KINOBE: Madam Chairperson, hon. Mwandha was wondering why Government is taking a cure that will not provide a solution. When you read the phrase and the objective, the major problem has been that of disciplining CAO’s and removing them from office when there is a problem. The objective of this Clause is to give the Public Service Commission powers to appoint, exercise disciplinary control and remove CAOs from office if they become impossible. As far as day-to-day work, monitoring, supervision and remuneration are concerned, everything is going to remain as it has been. 

MR MWANDHA: Madam Chairperson, the explanation given by my Brother hon. Kinobe is in total contravention of Personnel Management Principles. You cannot give one authority the appointing and dismissing powers and then have a different authority rewarding, assessing and evaluating a person. It cannot work. So, really -(Interruption)

MR LWANGA: Thank you Madam Chairperson and thank you hon. Mwandha for giving way. The honourable member is an accomplished auditor and he is very well aware of internal controls. I am surprised therefore that he is against strengthening internal controls in the Local Government management. I want to inform the member that Government is trying to strengthen internal controls as far as management of Local Governments is concerned by separating responsibilities.  Thank you.

MR MWANDHA: Madam Chairperson, the information hon. Lwanga has given has nothing to do with the principles of internal control. We are talking about the Chief Administrative Officer, the woman or man in charge of the district. Districts have structures for appointing and even disciplining these kinds of persons. If the structures are weak because Government has failed to do something about them, you cannot come to the Constitution and begin amending it – (Interjection) – I will take the information  -(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, this matter has been debated many times. I put the question that Clause 65(2) (Interruption)

MR KIWALABYE: Madam Chairperson, my amendment is on (3).

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Let us finish with (2) because that is what we are dealing with. I put the question that Clause 65, sub clause 2 do stand part of the Bill (Interruption)

MR WANDERA: I have a consequential amendment on Clause 188(2). Since we have created the position of Deputy Chief Administrative Officer, we must also provide in (2) that, “The Public Service Commission shall appoint persons to hold or act in the office of the Chief Administrative Officer and Deputy Chief Administrative Officer”.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: That is what we did in sub clause (1) where we said, “There shall be (Interruption)

MR WANDERA: Madam Chairperson, sub clause (1) simply talks about the existence of the Office of Chief Administrative Officer and Deputy Chief Administrative Officer and sub clause (2) talks about their appointment. Since the existing Clause 188(2) provides for the appointment of the Chief Administrative Officer by the Public Service Commission, it should in like manner provide for the appointment of Deputy Chief Administrative Officer.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable minister, do you intend that the Public Service Commission will also appoint the Deputy CAOs, the Town Clerks and so on? Is that your intention?

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, that is the spirit in which I accepted hon. Kinobe’s amendment. Since in effect when the CAO is not in office, the Deputy CAO performs the very functions that the CAO performs, it is only proper that the Deputy CAO like the CAO is also appointed and discharged by the Public Service Commission.  

PROF. KAMUNTU: Madam Chairperson, there are issues of consistency which the Attorney General can really help out with and I beg him to do so. Hon. Kigyagi proposed something as a balance between centralizing the appointment and payment of the CAO since he is centrally appointed, paid and disciplined. We could have a balance since there is debate about strengthening decentralization and building the capacity of decentralized units so that they can be able to discipline, appoint and even pay their officers –(Interjection)– if you can listen to me. 

It would make sense to say that the Chief Administrative Officer will be appointed by the public service but let us leave the deputy to be appointed by the District Service Commission. This way, we would have struck a balance. I wish to submit that this be reconsidered.

MR WANDERA: Madam Chairperson, that the salary of the LCV Chairman will be paid by the Central Government is a fact. If the salary of a politically elected person is paid by the centre, I see no reason why Prof. Kamuntu should find any problem with my proposal.  

The other thing I would like to refer him to is Article 176(2)(g). It says, “The Local Government shall oversee the performance of persons employed by Government to provide services in their areas and to monitor the provision of Government services or the implementation of projects in their areas”. Therefore, the supervisory function of the Local Government is still going to remain.  

Actually for me, this is a big concession because my submission to the committee was that all civil servants should be appointed by the Central Government – (Interjection) – please listen, because in certain districts, decentralization has become localization. 

If you do not come from a particular district you cannot get a job there. The Chief Administrative Officers are finding problems in disciplining certain people because of that.  For instance a chief may misappropriate money but because he is a son of a cousin or a grand father, they cannot take action. Therefore the earlier we free these people the better. I invite members to support this amendment that the Deputy CAO be appointed by the Public Service Commission under 188(2).

MS ERIYO: Thank you, Madam Chairperson. I do not have any problem with the amendments but I want to bring here the concern of my people. My people opposed this amendment and they do not want the Chief Administrative Officers to be appointed from the centre. Although I know this is going to happen, I want to raise their concern here because -(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Order members!

MS. ERIYO: Our people are worried because ever since this Government came to power, not a single person has been appointed as RDC, Deputy RDC, Assistant RDC or even a commissioner from my district and yet there are people who have qualified. Therefore, they fear that the Public Service Commission may easily– There are people who push their hands under the door and so forth and yet our people do not have the powers to reach such offices. Therefore, our sons and daughter may never be appointed by the Public Service Commission. I want to put this on record.

MRS MUKIIBI: Thank you Madam Chairperson, and I thank hon. Eriyo for giving way. The information I want to give is that the Public Service Commission appoints people on merit. It does not discriminate.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, this matter has been spoken for and against. I put the question that Clause 65(2) be amended as proposed by hon Wandera. 

(Question put.)

MR KIWALABYE: There is a small amendment I want to propose under (3) and it is a consequential amendment. I want to move that sub-clause (3) be amended to include Deputy Chief Administrative Officers as well. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, I put the question that sub-clause (3) be amended as proposed by hon Kiwalabye.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: This is the outcome of the vote on Clause 65. There were 4 abstentions, 13 members voted “No”, and 154 members voted “Aye”.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 65 agreed to.

Clause 66

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, before Clause 66, Government proposes to introduce an amendment called 65(a) whose effect would be to amend Article 191(2) of the constitution by repealing personal graduated tax. Members may recall that in his Budget Speech read by the Minister of Finance, His Excellency the President announced that with effect from the 1st of July 2005, the collection of personal graduated tax by Local Governments would cease.  

The Attorney General’s Chambers looked at Article 191(2) and ascertained that the levying and collection of personal graduated tax is mandatory by Local Governments. Therefore, if we left the Constitution as it is, nothing would stop Local Government from levying, charging and collecting graduated tax. It is for that reason that this amendment is introduced to formerly repeal personal graduated tax from the Constitution and to state that this amendment will be deemed to have come into force on the 1st of July 2005.  Madam Chairperson, I beg to move. 

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chairperson, the committee would wish to put on record that they received a proposal from hon. Dr. Okulo Epak to the same effect. If you look at our report on page 8, we make reference to his proposal to make the same deletion. Therefore, I would like to put on record that the committee received a proposal from Dr. Okulo Epak in advance. 

Secondly, I have just seen the proposal that this should take effect from the 1st of July 2005 but I do not think that is a constitutional matter. It should be left for whatever will operationalize this particular provision in the Acts of Parliament. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, I put the question that a new Clause 45(a) be inserted into the Bill –(Interjection)- you are creating a new clause. 

MR MWESIGE: Well, the effect of my amendment, Madam Speaker, is to repeal part of 191(2). So I would expect that it be voted on by roll call (Interruption)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: We are going there, but first we must agree to create a new one. (Interjection) You are seeking to introduce a new clause into the constitution. 

DR. OKULO EPAK: Madam Chairperson, about the said article and clause, the clause contains many other taxes which Local Governments may levy among which is the graduated tax and the proposal is that the personal graduated tax component be deleted. Therefore we are not repealing the whole of that clause. I do not know, maybe it is a question of legal language but I think that you do not have to introduce a replacement. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I am reading what the Attorney General gave me and he said, “Insert a new clause”.

DR. OKULO EPAK: Unfortunately, I had not seen the Attorney General’s proposal. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Attorney General, what do you want to do?

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, the amendment I am moving, is not in the Bill. Therefore, I am inserting a new clause in the Bill the effect of which is to repeal personal graduated tax from the Constitution. I have no problem if we insert it by show of hands first and then vote by roll call. I have no problem with that.

MR RUKUTANA: Madam Chairperson, after his consent the Chairperson raised an issue about sub-clause (2) regarding the commencement date and I did not heard what the Attorney General is proposing. In my view, it is important to maintain this date because it saves on the matter of arrears –(Interjections)- yes, if we do not put it, come the commencement of the Constitution, Local Governments will not be able to pursue defaulters who defaulted when the tax was still in force. 

MAJ. KINOBE: Madam Chairperson, the clarification I am seeking from the honourable minister is about the statement he made that Local Governments can tomorrow start chasing and imprisoning people because of arrears on graduated tax. This goes with the statement I read recently and it is attributed to hon. Kabwegyere. I know that the decision was a political commitment by the Government. Therefore, the arrears can remain in the books and become an audit query which the Auditor General may recommend that Parliament decide to wave off. 

However to send a signal that Local Governments can, even today, start harassing and chasing people is going to reverse the gains of the political commitment that was made by Government when we scrapped the tax. Let us be clear on this. If it is a question of arrears then it is in the books and we can handle it administratively at a later time. We should not to send a signal that whereas they have a cut of debt they can start harassing people about old tickets because this is going to reverse all the gains we had achieved out of this. I am seeking clarification from the Minister of Finance on this.

MR RUKUTANA: Madam Chairman, when Government came up with this policy, it was very clear when the policy would be effective. Any person who owed graduated tax and had not paid is still obliged to pay, even after the coming into force of the policy.  

If the amendment comes into force and it does not mention anything about the date, then that means, that revenue will be lost.  The policy came specifically with the commencement date, that is why it is important to maintain this commencement date in the constitution, because after the amendment has been approved, you cannot now put it in any other law.

MR MWONDHA:  I know honourable Mwesigwa Rukutana to be a very zealous tax collector (Laughter)  But I would like to inform him that the practice of collecting arrears of graduated tax is going to be very difficult and you are putting some of these officers in big trouble. They are going to find a lot of wrath in the population.  The earlier you keep quiet about it, the better for you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON:  Okay honourable members, let us do this: let us first delete one part and then insert a new one.  So, there is an amendment to delete personal graduated tax from the constitution.  Let us first deal with that.  

Those in favour of the deletion, vote by show of hands.  If you agree to incorporate the words  “personal graduated tax” into the bill, because that is what he wants to delete.  Those who support it?  

Now, honourable members, Article 191 has a number of taxes, one of them is personal graduated tax.  So, the minister says, let us amend Article 191 by removing it.  It is about removing the word personal graduated tax?  Isn’t it clear?

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chairperson, I think what is introducing that deletion is the proposed new clause 65(a).  

Now, once we approve the introduction of 65(a), then whatever decision we take on clause 65(a) would have the effect of doing that. But 65(a) as proposed now has two parts; we have objections on the second part.  So, I would propose that we deal with the objection on the second part of Clause 65(a); then we can proceed to adopt the amendment by roll call vote.  

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON:  What is the problem, we are doing 65(1) that is what we are dealing with before we go to 65(2).

MR OULANYAH:  Madam Chairperson, the whole of 65(a) is a clause in the bill.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON:  No, it cannot be in the bill when it is an amendment?

MR OULANYAH:  It has to be in the bill, so that when we take a decision in third reading, it is carried with the bill.  If it is not inserted in the bill, then it cannot reach third reading, because we would be doing third reading for the bill.  So, that is why 65(a) is proposed as a clause.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON:  But that is what we are doing honourable members. He has to put it into the bill and then we move.  Yes.  

So, honourable members raise your hands to insert a new clause into the bill.

(Question put.)
   
(The Members voted by a show of hands_)
 
THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, honourable members, there are no abstentions, no Nays, 123 Ayes.  The Ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON:  Now, sub clause (2) on the date.

CAPT BYARUHANGA:  Madam Chairperson, the personal graduated tax, which is in Clause 2 of Article 191, was operationalised by Parliament using the Local Governments Act. So, we should only amend the Local Government Act to remove this, instead of inserting the date in the Constitution.  I do not think that it is necessary to insert it in the constitution; we can only operationalise it by amending the Local Governments Act.

MR OULANYAH:  Madam Chairperson, I propose that sub clause 2 of Clause 65 be deleted. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Now, are you still interested in the arrears, we would like to be certain about that?

MR RUKUTANA: Madam chairperson, it is true that this clause was operationalised by the provisions of the Local Governments Act.  But once operationalised, it became effective.  

Now, if anybody is to collect any tax and I want to bring to the attention of the members the importance of collecting these arrears.  Government undertook to compensate local governments of graduated tax only with effect from the first day of July 2005.  

Local governments had entered into contracts in anticipation of graduated tax to be collected under this law.  The moment we pass these amendments, if we do not put this clause that means no local authority will proceed against any person for recovery of arrears, because there will be no basis and in the best of my understanding, that is not the policy.  

So, it is important to maintain this clause as it occasions no injustice in the Constitution.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: But honourable minister, for the last three or four years, the payment of this tax has been erratic. Do you really think that you are going to get people to pay this tax? Let us be realistic, they have not been paying anyway.

MR RUKUTANA: Madam Chairperson, I reluctantly withdraw my objection.

DR OKULO: Madam Chairperson, I am glad the honourable minister has withdrawn because I was under the impression that this is making the law applicable retrospectively. The effective date of implementing this thing is when the President assents to the Constitution. So it is not allowed to make a law retrospective and I hope the learned lawyer is not becoming spoiled by his concern for tax collection. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, we are looking at 65(a) 2. Those in favour of the Clause remaining as it is, raise your hands.

MR WANDERA: Madam Chair, may you clarify on the question you are proposing.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: You see nobody has moved a motion, so for me I am asking you what is already there. Move, because we have been going clause by clause.

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chair, I propose that Clause 2 of the proposed clause 65(a) be deleted.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON:  I put the question that the proposed clause 65(2) be deleted.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON:  Okay honourable members, this is the outcome of the vote on the amendment. Abstentions - 0; Nays – Nil; Ayes – 124.

(Question agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON:  Now honourable members I put the question that Clause  65(a) as amended do stand part of the Bill.

MR OULANYAH:  Madam Chair, clause 66 proposes to amend article 194 in relation to the Local Government Finance Commission.  The formulation in the Constitution is much better than what is proposed here.  

Madam Chairperson, the committee proposes that in the interest of the time that we have, this particular clause be deleted.

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, Government accepts the Committee’s recommendation.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable Members, the question is that Clause 66 be deleted.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable Members, these are the outcome of the vote: Abstentions –0; Nays – 0; Ayes - 114. The Ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 66 deleted.

Clause 67

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chairperson, Clause 67 proposes to amend Article 198 in relation to membership for the District Service Commission.  The Committee came to the conclusion that this particular proposal is not necessary at this time.  So Clause 67 should be deleted.

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, Government accepts the Committee’s recommendation.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable Members, the question is that Clause 67 be deleted.  

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

Clause 67 deleted.

Clause 68

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, I beg to introduce an amendment on behalf of Government as Clause 67(a) to amend Article 200 of the Constitution by inserting immediately after Clause 3 the following:

“Notwithstanding anything in this article and Articles 172 and 176(2) and (3) of this Constitution, the power to appoint persons to hold or act in the office of the Town Clerk in the service of a city or a municipality including the power to confirm appointments to exercise disciplinary control over persons holding or acting in any such office and to remove those persons from office is vested in Public Service Commission”.  

The justification for this amendment is to enable the town clerks of cities and municipalities to be better controlled and to ensure probity and accountability in the handling of the public funds as envisaged for the amendment we have just made for the Chief Administrative officers.  Madam Chairperson, I beg to move.

MR AMURIAT: Madam Chairperson, I wish to be advised on two matters.  The first one is whether it would not be appropriate for this particular amendment to apply to town clerks of town councils, some of which are actually very big.  Town councils are quite –(Interruptions)- Madam Chairperson, protect me.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable Members, allow him to make his presentations.

MR AMURIAT: Town Councils are actually more elaborate than sub-counties are.  Some of them just only fall short of being municipalities.  

Secondly, I would like to be advised by government- by the learned Attorney General, whether Article 200 is the appropriate home for this particular amendment.  Because when you read through Article 200 of the Constitution and refer to the marginal notice, there is not a big relation between what the Attorney General seeks to introduce under this article and what is already included under this article of the Constitution.  I would like to beg the House, Madam Chairperson, to find a better place to put this particular provision of the Constitution.  Thank you, Madam Chairperson.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable Members, as the Attorney General is preparing to answer, I would like to inform you that in the Gallery are Women Leaders from Kibale District. I would like to welcome them to this Parliament. (Applause) Yes, leaders from Kibale District, the honourable Minister of Public Service in charge of Pensions and all her other Colleagues.  

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chairperson, I wish to put it on record that as a Committee, we received proposals for amendment, which have significance of this nature from the hon. James Kubeketerya and the hon. Yeri Ofwono making similar proposals like the one which has been made by the Attorney General.  I wish to put this on record.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: The hon. Amuriat wanted to know about the Town Councils.

MR MWESIGE: Yes, Madam Chairperson, the home of this amendment will be sorted out by the first Parliamentary Council, provided we accept the principle.  Madam Chairperson, I would like to oppose the proposal to include town clerks of Town Councils, of course subject to the input of the Ministry of Local Government, because town councils are at the same status as sub-counties.  So if we were to transfer the recruitment of Town clerks to the centre, it would follow that all Sub-county Chiefs would also come to the centre, and I think that is going to the extreme; interfering with decentralization.  So I would suggest that hon. Amuriat respectively withdraws his amendment.

MR NSUBUGA NSAMBU: Well, I have heard the amendment, but I understand that these are things, which had been already decentralized.  I do not see any reason why the powers should be raised back to where they were.  We have reached a stage where, as I have heard, somebody very big in Uganda claims that he is going to dish out plots of land, which I think his own Ministers could do.  

Under the circumstances, I feel we should stick to our policies to see that there is adequate decentralization, but not lifting things back again.

MR YIGA: Madam Chairperson, in principle, I agree with the Attorney General, but I would like to move an amendment that we include the Deputy Town Clerk in this proposed amendment so that, as we did with the Chief Administrative Officer, we are very aware of who will deputize the Town Clerk of a City Council and a Municipal Council in case the Town Clerk is out of office or he has some other problems.  

That is how we shall enhance accountability, probity and all the other good reasons, which the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs proposed for the Chief Administrative Officer.  Madam Chairperson, I beg to move that we effect that amendment as well.  Thank you.

MR MUZOORA: Thank you very much.  The Office of the Deputy Town Clerk is a gazetted office, except that what he wants now is the appointment to be above.  

But since it is already a gazetted office, it is already known, and usually when the Ministry of Finance is appointing the officers, they mention even those who will deputize.  So I think it is not necessary to amend.  Thank you.  

MR LUKYAMUZI: Madam Chairperson, I am seeking clarification from the learned Attorney General.  Assuming that in the next chapter we succeed instituting the regional tiers, would that amendment you have just read out still apply?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Hon. Lukyamuzi, this amendment deals with Town Clerks of cities and municipalities.

MR LUKYAMUZI: I am saying, Madam Chairperson, that we still have another chapter on regional tiers, not so?  Suppose we institute regional governments, we expect that the regional governments would enjoy the autonomy capable of appointing such officers.  What has the Attorney General got to say about that?

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, the creation of the regional tier will not interfere with the status of district local governments at all.  It will not also interfere with the status of lower local governments, including municipalities and sub-counties.  

So there is no contradiction between this amendment and the anticipated introduction of the regional tier in Bill No.2; there is no contradiction at all.  

The regional government will not appoint the Chief Administration Officer (CAO) at the district, it will not appoint Sub-county Chief at the Sub-county; it will not affect the powers of local governments as we have them today.

MR LUKYAMUZI: If that is what the Attorney General is saying, then it is unfortunate because I do not see any power substance underlying the tier you are anticipating, and this is a serious matter.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, we are not discussing the regional tier today, that is Bill No. 2. This is Bill No. 3.  Are you insisting on your amendment, hon. Yiga?

MR YIGA: Madam Chairperson, I moved the amendment, I do not know whether the Attorney General is accepting it or not before I make any further –(Interjections)- do you support it?  

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chairperson, I would like to formally appeal to hon. Yiga for the reasons given by the former Town Clerk of Entebbe, who is an authority on these matters, to withdraw his amendment.

MR YIGA: Madam Chairperson, I withdraw.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Okay, thank you.  The question is that a new sub-clause (4) be introduced –(Interruption)

MR ERESU: Madam Chairperson, I live in Entebbe and the statement has intimated that the source of information is a former Town Clerk of Entebbe.  May I know whether the campaign sources of funds were from Entebbe?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Hon. Eresu, I want to rule you out of order for introducing irrelevant and malicious matters into this debate.  

MR ERESU: Madam Chairperson, I withdraw accordingly.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, I put the question that a new sub-clause (4) be introduced into the Bill.  We vote by show of hands.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands.)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, this is the position: Abstention – One; Nays –three; Ayes -109.

(Question agreed to)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that the new clause do stand part of the Bill.  We vote by roll call.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 68

MR OULANYAH: Madam Chair, Clause 68 proposes to amend by replacement of Article 203, which owes on the office of the Resident District Commissioner.  I should report that there were strong objections on this office. The reasons that were raised were that now you have centralized the appointment of CAOs and it was meant to be that he should be a senior civil servant and now that you are going to multi-partyism, there would be no need for a Resident District Commissioner. 

The Committee examined this but adopted the proposals in the Bill with an amendment in Clause 3(a) that the provision to monitor the implementation of central and local government services in the district should be amended by deleting the word local so that the supervision by the Resident District Commissioner is only restricted to central Government services in the district. While it may be justified for Resident District Commissioner to oversee central Government services, adding an oversight function over local services is a recipe for increased and unnecessary conflict. Local government services should be out. We proposed that amendment.

MR MWESIGE: Madam Chair, I would like to thank the Committee for recognizing the central role of the RDC in the district. I would however, with due respect, like to oppose the amendment proposed by the Committee, the reason being that even local government services are largely funded by central government funds. It is therefore, important that the RDC continues to monitor not only Central Government services but also local government services.

MR KIWALABYE: Madam Chair, I am one of those who made a submission to the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs and most particularly on this matter. I propose that the entire Article 203 in the Constitution be deleted. 

We all know the origin of this office of the RDC. It came about immediately NRM came from the bush, captured power and introduced a new ideology to Uganda. It was at that particular time that it was so necessary that somebody, I would call cadre, should be specially appointed first of all to mobilize the population and entrench the new ideology in the population. This office kept on changing the name from special District Administration to CGR, to whatever and now to RDC.  

This change of titles also went with change of roles because at that time as I said earlier, it was very necessary that somebody should be specially appointed to do the role of sensitization into this new ideology and at the same time ensure the beginning of the democratic process which would bring in other Ugandans into the system. I am happy to note that this office did a very tremendous work. Most of us are cadres because of that office and the democratic process, which continued strengthening all of us into the new ideology.
 
As the democratisation process continued, elections were made, new cadres came in and, therefore, the role of the RDC or the SDA started changing. Hence the role of mobilization is no longer the function of the RDC as we know him or her today. It is now the responsibility of the elected chairmen, say LC5s.

Today, the role of the RDC has changed. I would say that they have done the job so well and now we have reached even a point where we no longer think of the original ideology of the Movement. We are returning to multi-partyism, which means that that role is no longer there.

I therefore, feel that under the new dispensation, which we are going in, the role of the RDC is no longer necessary.  It is now a cause of conflict. We all know what is happening elsewhere, say in Busia, whatever you call it, but that personality also comes in form of a position.

The role of monitoring is now the responsibility of the LC5 and as the Committee said, we are having even the Chief Administrative Officer appointed by the centre and being disciplined from the centre.  So, under the new dispensation of multi-party system, I do not see the role of the RDCs. Therefore, I propose that Article 203 be deleted outright.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Hon. Oulanyah, I would like confirmation that hon. Kiwalabye brought the amendment and it was rejected before we proceed.

MR OULANYAH: Yes, Madam Chairperson, it is true it was rejected by the Committee.

MR MBABAZI: Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. I rise to oppose the motion by hon. Kiwalabye and the main ground is that hon. Kiwalabye I think has not fully internalized the workings of Government.

Uganda is still a republic with one central authority. The President according to this Constitution is the Chief Executive of Uganda and the Constitution says he will exercise that authority through subordinate offices as stipulated in the Constitution and other laws.  

When you look at the functions that are assigned to the Resident District Commissioner, they have nothing to do with the political system in place. It is simply talking about having an office, which represents central authority in the district and it charges, those functions that are specified, which are reserved for the central authority.

In the district, they have their own functions as you know. In this Constitution, we decentralized specific functions to be performed by the local government. The person, who oversees the functions of the central authority in the district, let us say security, is the Resident District Commissioner. Therefore, whatever political system we have in place as long as Uganda is a republic, as long as we have this central authority extending over the entire territory of Uganda, you will need representation of the Centre in the district.

I therefore, think the argument presented about Special District Administrator and so on does not touch the point behind the creation of this office, which is a presence of central authority in local government.  I therefore, oppose the amendment.

MRS MUKWAYA: Madam Chairperson, I stand to oppose the amendment on the following grounds. I think the office of the RDC - by the argument of hon. Kiwalabye Daniel, we are pushing our people into multi-partyism against their will –(Interjection) yes, let me speak for my constituency –(Interruption)

MR MWONDHA: Is hon. Janat Mukwaya, Minister of Agriculture, in order to say that we are pushing people against their will into multi-party system when actually on 28th of this month it is slated for a referendum?  Has she now adjudged the referendum?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, the people’s decision will be known after the 28th. Now we are just canvassing.  

MRS MUKWAYA: Madam Chairperson, I am going to mobilize but the report of Ssempebwa was very clear that this percentage of the population still wanted a status quo. You are discharging us on Wednesday to go and mobilize our people to vote for the tree in order to create a new political dispensation.  

The argument I am putting forward is that the more reason - because people have lived in this all-inclusive political system - that the office of the RDC should be protected to go and mobilize the people to understand the new political dispensation to live in harmony as we have been as if there was no change.

But, Madam Chairperson, I want to draw the attention of this House that we may have a President elected nationally with the minority in the House and the minority in the local governments. How would this President hopefully with a coalition Government enforce his or her mandate in the population if you deny that person a presence in the local Government?  

So we should not really consider personalities –(Interruption)

MR KIDEGA: (Interruption)

MRS MUKWAYA: Let me develop my point then I will allow you. You should separate personalities from offices. Even here we have had Members of Parliament who do not respect others but because we are controlled by the Speaker we have lived in harmony because we have the office of the Speaker.

So, I want to plead with my Colleagues that where we are going this office is more necessary than even. I want also to add that our biggest challenge, whether you are in Government or you are a backbencher, is actually service delivery to our people. But we have known that some councillors and some chairpersons much as there are political leaders in the district - because of tender awarding and what not - have created problems.  

The Committee on local Government reported here the report that we debated. So, I want to plead with you that fair equity demands that there must be an arbitrator who is not a participant in the day-to-day management of the business of the councils.

DR KIBIRIGE SEBUNYA: Madam Chairperson, I am actually thinking about Nava Nabagesera, when she was RDC in Bugiri, she almost lost her life there fighting corruption. I am also thinking about my friend Bageya Patrick with all the problems that he is having in the district of Busia, fighting corruption. May I think about my own RDC Lukooya Mukome and thank him for all the work that he has done in Wakiso district. We always move together to ensure security. We always move together with this Mukoya of mine in monitoring and evaluating all the other government programmes.

We in Wakiso district are under the tyranny of the rich from Kampala. They have bought all our land; they are chasing us off our Bibanja. -(Interjections). These rich people from Kampala some of whom are in this House, are chasing us from our land and the only person we can turn to is our RDC to protect us. May I plead with everybody in this House to ensure that we maintain this position of RDC otherwise there is a lot of trouble.

MR ETONU: I thank you, Chairperson. I would like to take you back to the history of this country. RDC is not a new office, we used to have a District Commissioner who is now actually the post of RDC. -(Interjections)-  Please listen. There was a Secretary-General during the multi-party system who is now the equivalent of LC5 chairman and a Deputy Secretary who is now supposed to be CAO. Now there are no new developments, we are not creating new offices here.  

There was no confusion that time when we had multi-party system. DC or RDC now as we call him is a central man in the district, -(Interjections)- or woman okay. Sorry a central woman or man in the district. The duties of a District Commissioner as I knew it - because at one time I was administrative officer - is to monitor all government activities in that district. I did it and we also have to care and look after the security of the district so as to allow even monitoring all the activities of other departments in that district.

If you remove the post of RDC, then there is no way a central government will know what is going on in that particular district and, therefore, we need to retain this post. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I want to hear those for the motion. Now hon. Kiwalabye, it would appear there is nobody speaking for your position. (Interjections)

MR ANANG-ODUR: Madam Chairperson, my belief is that we are trying to amend this Constitution and this particular clause in order to improve service delivery. We have just amended a part, which brings appointment of the CAO to the centre, the Chief Administrative Officer is now going to be appointed by the central government. In my own simple understanding of government, what I have in mind is, with the new arrangement we are now able to have the Chief Administrative Officer reporting directly to the Minister of Local Government who in turn will be able to report to the President.

In the district as we have it now, we have the chairperson. Now the chairperson is responsible for the well-being of his district. With the appointment of this Chief Administrative Officer now not in his hand, I think it is going to be important for him to make sure that this person performs and I know we are also looking at the operation of tender boards and so on so that we reduce on the corruption at other levels, which is our major concern.

Secondly, the central Government has got –(Interruption)-

MR MIKE SEBALU: Thank you very much my Colleague for giving way. You know we can get a chairman and definitely we must have a country moving together in terms of mobilizing for agreed national policies.

Now in a situation where the chairman LC5 is elected and is not in support of useful government policies, then how do you expect government presence to be realised in that area to be able to mobilize the people along those useful programmes? How would that be done for example? 

MR ANANG-ODUR: Madam Chair, what we have to understand is that if Government has come with a policy -(Interruption)-

PROF. KAMUNTU: The information I want to give to the honourable Member is that, while the Chief Administrative Officer is appointed by the Public Service Commission, he reports to the district council and he is not required by the virtue of his appointment to report to the President.  

Consequently, once you have a Presidential system of governance where the President gets his mandate from the universal suffrage of the entire country - If he had a manifesto and policy programme, which does not tally with the programmes of a district because the district itself has an elected chairman, he would have considerable difficulty to get the report back to him on his programme. This is the information I thought should be given to distinguish between the office of Chief Administrative Officer and the role of the Resident Commissioner.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON:  Yes former RDC.

MR PETER LOKERIS: Thank you, Madam Chairperson. Not only former RDC, I was SDA, I was DA, I was Administrative Secretary, I was a district treasurer and I have all those qualifications. 

MR OKUPA: Madam Chairperson, the hon. Minister has just told us that he has qualifications of RDC SDA, treasury. Is he in order to assume that appointments are qualifications?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, in this House we come from different backgrounds and different experiences. What the minister is saying is that he has done several kinds of work and he wants us to know about it.

MR LOKERIS: Thank you, Madam Chairperson.   That is precisely what I said that I have done most of this. During our time, these very positions existed, the District Commissioner was there supervising the districts and reporting directly to the President and other specified offices.  I, who was then Administrative Secretary, was reporting to the Council and to the Ministry of Local Government. There is no contradiction at all. I think we are putting things in the right perspective. Thank you.

MR ANANG-ODUR: Madam Chairperson, I am very surprised indeed. You see this is the way government should work. Once the President has come with his mandate, manifesto, and this has been translated into government policy, it is the duty of those in the administrative line to make sure that this is implemented. 

So, I would expect that the President through the line ministries and through the CAOs would give his orders, which must be respected. This is the way it should be. Now if anybody in the district, CAO or whoever refuses to implement the President’s directives through policies he must be brought to book. In fact we should not wait for the RDC to come and report to the President because the reported land is very clear. I am so surprised hon. Prof. Kamuntu that this point seems not to be clear. 

What we are trying to say here is that we should improve on the institution of government. We should not think that the President should do everything for us. In fact what we are trying to say is, without the President taking action himself, we cannot move and we are saying -(Interruptions)

MR WAMBUZI: Madam Chairperson, is the honourable Anang-Odur in order to suggest that when the Mayor of Kampala, his Worship Ssebaana Kizito, starts saying the President’s programme is contrary to what we want, therefore, according to him the Mayor should be punished for taking a path, which is contrary to the Government? Is he in order to suggest that in a situation like that people who have contravening views should be punished?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: No, we shall not legislate for anarchy, so he is out of order.

MR ANANG-ODUR: What is being said is that if the Mayor is wrong, he should be punished; he is not above the law. My other point is that we are now talking about cost of administration. Although we have been saying that democracy is expensive and so on, there are certain things as a country, taking into account the various needs we have, which are very urgent, that we can actually afford to avoid certain costs. To me the RDCs are almost an unnecessary additional cost to government and we should try to avoid this. We have so many problems in the north, we have so many problems elsewhere in this country and this money could be well saved.

Lastly, on the issue of corruption, I really do not want to drum this issue because first of all we have failed even at the Central Government to stamp out corruption. I am not saying it should not be done at the district level. It is a fact and I believe that corruption is worse in the centre than at the district. 

If we are trying to fight corruption, it is not through the RDCs, it is government action first at the centre and then we can move down. We have got other institutions, we have got the IGG and so on, which can help. We have DISOs and others who can help to track down those who are corrupt and bring them to book, not necessarily the RDCs. I therefore, support strongly the idea of striking off this particular provision.  I thank you.

MR LUKYAMUZI: Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. Madam Chairperson, I will just give two points. I have been listening to the debate very attentively and I would like to thank hon. Kiwalabye for having been bold enough to call a spade a spade. We all appreciate the power of the Presidency but as we move into a new political dispensation, there are certain sacrifices we should volunteer to make.  For example, you all know that the donors have already made a protest, namely, that we are spending a lot on administration. If we are spending too much on administration, the time is now for us to improve on our expenditure as we go into a new dispensation.  

For example, the RDC is supposed to represent a President in a district.  –(Interruptions)

MR BASALIZA ARAALI: Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. Is hon. Lukyamuzi right to play double standards when the same person was supporting federo, which is more costly than the single RDC in the district? Is he in order to advocate for double standards?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, when we are considering the national purse, we should be objective. So he is out of order.

MR LUKYAMUZI: I will go by your ruling. But under a federo arrangement, you do not need a multiplicity of RDCs. You only require a single presidential representative in the region and what does that translate to?  I want to concretize my point. The President is represented purportedly by the RDC in the district. 

The person the RDC is representing is supposed to be the fountain of honour. We have three important sectors where we would require such a person. The first is, in regard to security, fighting corruption and monitoring. The point I want to make is that the equivalence of a CAO, a Police Commander, a Town Clerk, an IGG, Auditor-General - all these are represented at the district level in one-way or the other. So, they can marshal and tussle to ensure that they fight corruption and they also check on monitoring. Is it worthwhile?

MRS MUKWAYA: Madam Chairperson, while I appreciate the point my brother hon. Ken Lukyamuzi is making, he is arguing that because we have a Police Commander and these people, we do not need the office of the RDC. But many times hon. Lukyamuzi exhibits himself as Chairman, LC1, a Muluka Chief in Lubaga South, and he continues to be the MP and nobody has complained that he does this work very well. But he also knows that the chairmen who are supposed to mobilize resources in their respective areas have failed, that is why the Central Government is going to pay them. That is also cost on administration.

MR LUKYAMUZI: Yes, Madam Chairperson, a good leader in a crisis period takes up any challenge. What is she talking about?  

The last point I want to make is about the political role a Resident District Commissioner (RDC) plays in a district. You are all elected leaders; do not be narrowed down by the equivalent of RDCs. Once you are elected as a Member of Parliament, you are elected as Chairman LC5, you are elected as Chairman LC3, you have all the political potential capable of putting things correct in your area and under the new –(Interjection)- so in conclusion I would like to persuade you all, regardless of the side you may politically share, to appreciate the input of comrade Kiwalabye because it is a just demand that we understand.  Thank you very much.

ABSTENTIONS:

1.	Pajobo Bruno 


MR ARUMADRI: As we tally the votes, it is now almost certain that we shall have RDCs and I want to give a word of caution here. (Laughter)  Usually, ministers who lose elections are the first people to be appointed RDCs and when they get there they use their office to malign those who defeated them. This is happening in the field. I hope this time round RDCs will be impartial.  

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I think the ministers in charge have taken note of this. Have you noted his worry?

MRS WABUDEYA: Madam Chairperson, I had wanted to rise on a point of order, but now that I have been given an opportunity to speak, I would like to dispute what my colleague is saying. I do not know whether all the ministers who have lost have been appointed RDCs. I think I am just hearing it from him today and I would like to put the record right. He is just inflaming the voters in this House with out reason.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: But hon. Arumadri, are you of the view that anybody who loses an election becomes useless? Do people who lose in elections become useless?

MR ARUMADRI: Madam Chairperson that is not what I am imputing.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, this is the outcome of the vote; Abstention - 1, Noes – 9, Ayes - 124. The Ayes have it. (Applause)

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 68 agreed to.

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Adolf Mwesige):  Madam Chairperson, I beg to move that the House do resume and the Committee of the Whole House reports thereto.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Madam Speaker, I beg to report.

MOTION OF THE ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Adolf Mwesige): Madam Speaker, I beg to move that the report of the Committee of the Whole House be adopted.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I put the question that the report of the Committee of the Whole House be adopted.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Now, honourable members, I want to thank you for the amount of work you have done today but because we did not all come at the same time, we lost a total of two hours, which could have been used in completing this work.  So, I would like to appeal to you to come in time tomorrow at 10.00 O’clock so that all those can be done.  So, the House is adjourned to tomorrow morning at 10.00 O’clock.
