Parliament met at 3.15 p.m. in Parliament House, Kampala.

PRAYERS

(The Speaker, Mr Rebecca Kadaga, in the chair.)

The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you to this afternoon’s sitting, and I will begin by adjusting the Order Paper to bring item four in the place of item three; the statements will come after the committee of supply.

I also want to welcome hon. Hussein Kyanjo, who has been away on sick leave for several months. He has returned; I will be giving him one minute to just say hullo to you.

I also wanted to inform the Minister of Agriculture, that during the weekend, I was in Kiruhura with hon. Col. Mwesigye and other Members of Parliament, and one of the biggest complaints we received was the issue of East Coast Fever, and farmers are unhappy that we have not attended to their plight.

They have lost nearly 6000 heads of cattle, and they need an urgent response. I hope the Minister of Agriculture can rise to the occasion and help to handle this issue.

So, let me invite hon. Kyanjo to say hullo to the Members of Parliament.

MR HUSSEIN KYANJO (JEEMA, Makindye Division West, Kampala): In the name of God most gracious and merciful. Madam Speaker, and honourable members, I consider myself privileged to be able to address this House after an unsolicited absence of a couple of months.

During this period, I have followed some of the debates, enjoyed the deliberations, and missed the fun.

I have wished all of you success and prosperity in your tasks of serving mother Uganda in this very important way.

I continue to associate myself very strongly and proudly with your efforts to give this country a democratic election.

In fighting corruption, I wish to congratulate and welcome into the House the new Members who have joined the House during my absence, and to wish them the very best.

In the same breath, I wish to convey my sincere condolences for the death of our colleague from Katakwi, and other Ugandans, among whom are the late professors Kakoma and Senteza Kajubi.

As Members may have learnt from the Speaker, the reason for my absence has been changing shape. First, it was jaw dislocation, which was treated, but when I went for a review, new findings were revealed; I had another serious disease called Dystonia. I think the doctors will help us in future, to tell us exactly what it is, but the little I was able to be informed of, was that Dystonia is a condition which causes involuntary movement of some parts of the body. My case is vocal Dystonia of the tongue, which makes speech difficult, painful and sometimes frustrating.

Over the past months, I have shared the pain of my colleagues, friends, members of my family and other loved ones as they have watched me struggle to say what I wanted, and many times failing to do it. It has been a heart-breaking experience, which I am not quite done yet. I have been under the care of some of the most skilled medical personnel.

I would like to place on record my appreciation for the support given to me during this period. I am greatly indebted to the Rt Hon. Speaker of Parliament, Deputy Speaker, the Leader of Opposition, the Parliamentary Commission, the Office of the Clerk and the National Medical Board of Uganda to most especially to hon. Latif Ssebaggala and hon. Kaddunabi, who were running my communication while I was still in hospital. They took off time to come and visit me all the way in Dubai.

Some of you have visited me physically in hospital in Dubai and at home, and others have consistently inquired about my health on phone and by mail.

The support has been very touching, and it has been a very great source of inspiration and strength for my family because this has been one of the most stubborn diseases that they have learnt of. 

The doctors in that regard have advised me to do the opposite of what I would have loved to do most; they have stopped me from talking for long. Imagine someone stopping Kyanjo from talking for long; it is not a simple thing.

Finally, I want to appeal to all of you honourable members, to always create time on purpose to carry out regular medical check-ups because sometimes some of the illnesses that attack us can be prevented early enough. 

The doctors laughed at me and asked me how I had lived with this condition for all this long. They expected my doctor to have advised me.

I told them that I did not have a doctor; when I read a signpost with “Doctor” on it, I go there and get treatment. They laughed, but continued to give me the best medication.

I want to associate myself to the appeal to invest more in the health sector following what I have gone through.

I am an MP who can afford extra treatment abroad, but what about a poor Ugandan in Rwashamaire? Really, what would you expect such a patient to do?

Madam Speaker, I want to thank you for your generous and open heart towards some of us when we get into trouble. My old father was telling me, when I visited him, that people were calling him to tell him that Hussein Kyanjo has died.

He said that, “I did not send Hussein to work on a radio station. I accepted that he goes and works in Parliament and Parliament has leader. I think I will listen to death announcements of Hussein from the Speaker.” So, Madam Speaker, my father is 97, and he is waiting for your announcement in case I died.

MR JOHN SSIMBWA (NRM, Makindye Division East, Kampala): Thank you very much Madam Speaker. I am rising on a matter of national importance. 

Madam Speaker and dear colleagues, our city Kampala is under a lot of tension, fear -is under “siege” - I think that is the best word I should use. 

The people of Kampala come from all over the country – because Kampala is composed of people from the whole country - cannot leave their homes now to go to hospital, work or look for food because of fear and tension. This tension has come up as a result of the actions of the Executive Director of Kampala Capital City Authority and her staff.
 
Madam Speaker, we have seen evictions and demolitions taking place, and people being displaced without considering what was agreed upon between the evictees and the former KCC. This has brought a lot of tension.

Today morning, the tension involved the honourable Minister of Trade; she had a confrontation with the officers of KCCA while they were demolishing Centenary Park.

MR SSEBAGALA: Thank you so much Madam Speaker and honourable colleague for giving way.

Madam Speaker, ee are representatives of the people and we were elected to do so, but what is going on in Kampala leaves a lot to be desired.

The most disturbing thing is that Parliament authorised what is going on simply because the chairman of the Presidential Affairs Committee, hon. Tinkasiimire, met with the Executive Director.  

So, they are now saying that it is Parliament that has ordered yet we know according to our rules that whenever there is anything that has been handled by the committee, it must come to the Floor of Parliament.

Now hon. Tinkasiimire is masquerading around Kampala that he is working on behalf of Parliament, yet we know that as far as these allegations are concerned, that they have employed three of hon. Tinkasiimire’s sisters in KCCA, and he is even a regular visitor to the Executive Director of Kampala Capital City Authority -

THE SPEAKER: Honourable member, I think you should not make unsubstantiated allegations. Just concentrate on the problem do not make allegations.

MR SSEBAGALA: Madam Speaker, according to our rules of procedure, when an issue is being handled by the committee, before they pronounce themselves, they must come to Parliament; but the feeling created in Kampala right now is that Parliament authorised what is going on.

MR SSIMBWA: Madam Speaker, as Members from Kampala are not against the idea of organising Kampala, but the way these issues are being handled is what we are against.

MS AMONGIN: Thank you Madam Speaker for giving me this opportunity. The information I want to give regards the situation in Kampala today. I want to give an example of Nsambya. Madam Speaker, if we leave what is going on to continue, we shall find ourselves with a bigger challenge.

We have to agree that we have all contributed in one way or another in disorganising Kampala City. Therefore, now is not the time to wake up and order Police to demolish buildings anyhow. NEMA should come up clearly to define the gazetted areas. We then protect those people who are already settled in those areas, and stop further encroachment. Because, where shall we settle the hundreds of people already settled in those areas, if we continue in the way we are handling the issue? We should come up with clear guidelines. 

Today, while I was driving from Munyonyo, I met a group of people - over 1000 - and they were crying. I stopped and they told me that they cannot go to work because they had been told that next week all their properties would be destroyed.

I think as Parliament, we should be humane; we also need that sustainable development. I can site some countries where wetlands have been reclaimed for settlement. Now is the time for us to come together, work closely with KCCA and NEMA, and ensure that we protect the people, while ensuring that we protect the wetlands as well; rather than just waking up one morning and you find that you are nowhere. Madam Speaker, we are moving in the wrong direction now as we speak.

MR SSIMBWA: As I conclude on this matter, we have said that we are not against what is happening, but the way it is being done.

THE SPEAKER: No, honourable members, this is becoming a debate. I thought you were raising issues for the minister.

MR SSIMBWA: Madam Speaker, it is a matter which concerns many of the Members because they reside in Kampala; they see what is happening and the image of Parliament is being tarnished.

THE SPEAKER: Can I finish my urgent item? Let us finish the committee of supply and then we deal with this issue later.

Votes 501 to 778 - Local Governments 

THE CHAIRPERSON: I put the question - 

MR MWIRU: Madam Chairperson, I seek clarification in respect to vote 755, Jinja Municipal Council. I happened to have been in Parliament but now I see some cuts, up to Shs 70 million, from the development budget. When we were in this Parliament, the Prime Minister supplied the list of the proposed cuts and did not actually include this. I am therefore seeking clarification from the chair about how this is coming about. On some votes I can see that they are adding to their development budgets but for Jinja, I see there is a cut of Shs 70 million.

THE CHAIRPERSON: Can the Minister for Finance explain? Honourable member, did you say that money for Jinja local government has been cut?

MR MWIRU: Yes. It has been cut by Shs 70 million and yet I see there is increment on some votes. Also, on the list supplied by the Prime Minister on the proposed cuts, it did not actually appear as one of the areas where there were proposed cuts. I am seeking clarification from the minister.

THE CHAIRPERSON: Can the minister explain?

MR OMACH: This is a result of a corrigenda and it was supplied to all members. 

THE CHAIRPERSON: Hon. Mwiru, do you have this list because it is here under corrigenda?

MR MWIRU: I remember very well that when the committee actually came back to report, the chairperson of the committee informed the House that there was no report. If you remember, the issue was that we had agreed that money would be cut from various areas and the committee would report to the House. When they came back, they told us they had no reports and so they did not report to us in respect to that. They only supplied a list from the Prime Minister, and I remember he came with a list that was not signed. When they proposed the cuts, we did not see the corrigenda which is actually being talked about. The corrigenda talks about cuts but here I see that there are cuts and also increments for some districts. If the issue was cuts, then it would have been identified where there were actually cuts. That is why I am seeking the clarification.

MS AKOL: I thank you. I think the honourable member here is confusing two issues. When the budget estimates book was presented, corrigenda was laid on the Table and every member got a copy. It is that corrigenda that introduced those amendments to the budget estimates book. The cuts that you are talking about came much later, and those cuts are reflected under a separate paper - I wish we had this paper. If you have it, it is reflected under Parliament, and your municipality is not among those that were cut. I just want to give you that clarification. Thank you.

THE CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that the total sum of Shs 397,338,178,000 be provided for from vote 501 to vote 778, local governments, as development expenditure for FY 2012/2013.

(Question put and agreed to.)

(Question put and agreed to.)

MR LUBOGO: Thank you. I seek further clarification from the honourable member from Jinja about the issue he raised. We have been told that the deductions are reflected under the column of Parliament. However, as far as I remember, the Prime Minister tabled figures which totaled to Shs 6.5 billion but under this column, we have a total of Shs 11 billion. I am therefore seeking clarification as to how, if actually this column caters for those deductions that were made here, it comes to Shs 11 billion. Thank you.

THE CHAIRPERSON: Which paper are you looking at?

MR LWANGA: Thank you. The deductions and additions under Parliament are not only Shs 6.5 billion. The Shs 6.5 billion is just a portion; so you have a total of everything that has gone in and the adjustments that we put forward before. Originally, we had estimates and as you read, you will see what has happened. When you get to the Parliament column, you either see a negative or a positive. A negative is a deduction, a positive is an addition. At the end of the day you have a total, and that is what it is. It will not exactly agree with the Shs 6.5 billion. Is it understood? (Interjection) Some are from the finance committee, which made adjustments. Thank you.

THE CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, on the grand total budget, I put the question that the total sum of Shs 11,475,352,187,000 be provided as the grand total government expenditure for the FY 2012/2013.

MOTION FOR ADOPTION OF THE REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY

5.11
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Ms Maria Kiwanuka): Madam Speaker, I beg to move that the report from the Committee of Supply be adopted.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I put the question that the report of the Committee of Supply be adopted. 

(Question put and agreed to)

(Report adopted.)

THE SPEAKER: I want to congratulate the Minister of Finance for finally getting over this hurdle, and of course to thank the members for their co-operation in this very long exercise.  

Honourable members, I am delighted to introduce my voters. They are in the public gallery. They have come from Kiyunga in Kisozi. You are welcome. Tusangaire okubabona! (Applause) We also have another team from Kibaale District represented by hon. Kasaija, hon. Tinkasiimire, hon. Nabanja and hon. Besisira. (Applause)

I think the Minister of Finance has time to present the Appropriation Bill tomorrow because we have a sitting. Is it here? We have a special sitting tomorrow, if she wants to take advantage of it.   

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Fred Omach): Madam Speaker and honourable colleagues, we could not do the printing of the Appropriation Bill before the supply. But now that we have supplied, we are going to take it to the printery and we think that by 2 O’clock we should be able to appropriate. 

THE SPEAKER: Can’t you do it earlier? Can’t we do it at midday, at the end of our special sitting?

MR OMACH: We may not be ready by midday but by 2 O’clock we shall be ready. 

THE SPEAKER: But it is in your interest to sleep in the printery today.

MR OMACH: Okay. We shall do our best to make sure that by 12 O’clock, it is here in Parliament. Thank you.

MINISTERIAL STATEMENT

5.14
THE MINISTER FOR THE PRESIDENCY (Mr Muruli Mukasa): Madam Speaker, come 9th October this year, Uganda will celebrate 50 years of our independence. This is a milestone in the history of our country. So, a number of commemorative activities and events have been planned for which some are already being implemented. Some of the commemorative activities include the following: 

Commemoration Project on the Redevelopment of Kololo Ceremonial Grounds 
This project started on 9th May this year and will be executed in two phases. The works are being executed by Medallion as the main contractor but being assisted by UPDF Engineers’ Brigade providing labour and close supervision.

Phase I of the works will be completed by the end of this month, and it involves the following:
i) 	Construction of a three-bay suspended pavilion with a seating capacity of 5,280 people; 

ii) 	Paving the parade ground, of approximately 5,400 square metres, using concrete pavers including associated kerbing and drainage works; 

iii) Construction of two monuments - the Independence Golden Jubilee Monument and the Monument of the Unknown Soldier; and

iv) Repair of the existing roads, landscaping, lighting and face lifting of the 1962 flag post.

Phase II of the works will begin after the celebrations and will include the following:
•	Construction of a VVIP pavilion 
•	Construction of roads 
•	Car parking 
•	Landscaping and fencing 
•	Solar power plant 
•	Construction of a police post, health club, conference and recreation facility.

The works on the pavilion are being finalised. The external works are complete and the pavilion seats have been fixed. The contractor is in the process of paving around the pavilion and installing the sewerage lines.

The parade ground has been completed with pavers. The sweeping of the parade ground to rid it of debris and drainage works is on-going. We are hopeful that by 9th October this year, everything will be ready.

Construction of the Monument of the Unknown Soldier is already complete. It is located at the Heroes’ Corner. The Independence Golden Jubilee Monument is now complete and is adjacent to the parade ground. 

Finishing touches are being done on the existing roads along with the finishing of the construction of a temporary road along the Lower Kololo Terrace, so that access to the grounds is made easy.

Madam Speaker, I request that we turn to paragraph 3 of page 3 and look at other commemorative activities. The launch of the commemorative year celebrations was done on the 5 May 2012 at Serena Conference Centre. During that launch, which was presided over by H.E the President, the Golden Jubilee theme, logo and website were unveiled. The theme is: “A 50 Year Journey since Independence (1962-2012): a good foundation for social and economic transformation.” The logo was given to the media houses for publicity purposes and indeed some of them, including members of the private sector and government departments, are already publicising it.

Another commemorative activity involved the “Plant a tree initiative”. This initiative was tagged to the monthly theme, “Climate Change is real: conserve and protect our environment.” This theme was also launched by H.E. the President on 9 June 2012 during the 23rd  Heroes Day Anniversary celebrations held at Kitunguru in Mbarara District. This launch kick-started the nationwide planting of trees in an environmental drive, which shall continue well beyond the celebration season. 

The National Forestry Authority agreed to provide between 5,000 to 10,000 tree seedlings per district for planting. The exercise targets government institutions and civil society organisations, among others. Resident District Commissioners (RDCs) are spearheading this tree planting in their respective areas of jurisdiction. The President’s Office has earmarked Shs 500,000 per district for mobilisation purposes. 

The districts shown below have already been contacted and the distribution is already on-going. These include: Mukono, Hoima, Butaleja, Mubende, Nakasongola, Mpigi, Kasese, Mbale, Kyenjojo, Masindi, Ibanda, Mbarara, Mityana, Ntoroko, Buvuma, Bududa, Kabarole, Kyegegwa, Kaberamaido, Arua, Mayuge, Kiryandongo, Kibaale and Rukungiri.

Madam Speaker, it was felt that because the exercise had started somewhat late, we would concentrate on those districts around the lake crescent, which have a lower period of rainfall before the onset of the dry season. Other districts will be considered in the next rainy period next year.

A national public lecture, as part of the commemorative activities, was supposed to be conducted on Saturday, 29 September 2012 focusing on the theme of the Independence Golden Jubilee celebrations. The President was supposed to be one of the chief celebrants at this public lecture, which would involve renowned scholars like Prof. Augustus Nuwagaba and Dr Samuel Sejjaaka as presenters. 

The public lecture has been postponed to Tuesday next week due to the involved programme of H.E. the President, but it will still be held at the Serena Conference Centre. Over 1,000 dignitaries have been invited from government departments and the private sector. Members of Parliament and the diplomatic corps have also been invited.

The jubilee song was launched on the 4 September 2012 at the independence sculpture adjacent to Sheraton Hotel. It is now sang and played by many of our broadcast media houses.

Madam Speaker, there will be two “Uganda at 50” video documentaries - a one-hour documentary and a 45-minute documentary focusing on the theme for the Golden Jubilee celebrations. These documentaries are in the process of being produced.

In addition to that, there will be golden jubilee publications. There is going to be a commemoration book detailing parts of Uganda’s modern history from 1962 to the present 2012. We expect to produce 1,000 copies. There will also be a golden jubilee coffee table book. This one will entail a photo documentation of Uganda, again from 1962 to 2012, and it will also include the 2012 celebrations. 

We expect that the first book will be finished before the celebrations. The one of 2012 actually will be produced soon after the celebrations because we expect some of those photos that will be shown to include the actual photos taken on 9 October 2012.

We are today going to have a cultural evening at the Serena Conference Centre. Many people have been invited to attend this event including Members of Parliament, the diplomatic corps and the private sector. The activities during this event will include, among others, a one-hour theatrical production by Alex Mukulu. This production is a theatrical rendition of what we have gone through from 1962 up to the present, – (Interjections) - bananas inclusive.

Madam Speaker, as part of the commemorative events, and because we are a God-fearing nation, we are going to hold national thanksgiving prayers on 8th October and these prayers are being organised by the Office of the First Lady. These prayers will be carried out at the Serena Conference Centre.

In addition, we also expect to hold a cultural festival gala and within this there will be many activities taking place. This gala has been made possible with the help of the European Union and the African Union Travelling Art Exhibition. 

There are already several events that have taken place as part of the cultural festival gala. There has been the Mayors’ Conference, and this was held on 18th September at City Hall. After that conference, the mayors and the rest of the public gathered for the official opening of the art exhibition, Pavilion, at the KCCA railway grounds. A workshop for artists took place on the 20th at the Uganda Museum. The exhibition at Kampala Capital City Authority railway grounds started on the 18th and will go on up to the 14th October this year.

In addition to the EU taking part in these activities, Makerere University and Bayimba Foundation also assisted in organising this gala. They will also hold the Kampala Art Festival in 12 locations in Kampala, which will start from the 7th up to the 14th October: 

•	There is a Chinese troupe spearheaded by the Chinese Embassy in Uganda and it has also come to take part in our celebrations. Today the Chinese have come as friends of Uganda and they are also marking 50 years of excellent cordial Uganda-China relations.

Actually, today they are going to be carrying out a public performance at the railway grounds in the evening before the public. Tomorrow, 28th , they will carry out a performance for VIPs and Members of Parliament at the National Theatre. So, VIPs and Members of Parliament, you are cordially invited to come to the National Theatre tomorrow from 6.00 p.m. to about 8.00 p.m. to enjoy this art performance.

The Chinese have also donated a number of books at our public library this morning. Interviews with various ministers - finance, gender, foreign affairs and so on -  have been conducted.

•	The Bayimba Festival was held between the 21st and 23rd of September at the National Theatre. 

•	There is the National Jubilee Family Summit organised by the Ministry of Gender and Family Life Network. A breakfast was also organised, and the National Jubilee Family Summit was held on the 22nd September at Nakivubo Stadium.

•	Between 5th and 8th, there is going to be the Uganda Cultural Festival at Lugogo Cricket Oval. It is again spearheaded by the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development, Office of the President and the Uganda Cultural Gala Secretariat.

•	The National Women’s Week is planned for between October 5th and October 7th at Hotel Africana.

There is going to be an Independence Dinner organised by the Private Sector Foundation. This will be on 9th October 2012 after the celebrations. As is customary, normally before Independence Day celebrations, the Uganda Manufacturers’ Association also holds an exhibition. This is going to take place between 4th up to about 9th or beyond. Ministries, departments and agencies have also been given space to exhibit something at the UMA grounds.

On 8th October, it is expected that Bujagali will actually be switched on. That occasion will be used to commemorate two very important books written about Uganda, detailing the period between 1962 and 2012. One has been written by a Ugandan and the other by a non-Ugandan.

On the 7th October, in the morning, from about 8.00 a.m. to evening, the Kampala Carnival will take place for the residents of Kampala to express their joy in a carnival manner on the main streets. You are of course welcome to take part.

On the same day, 7th October, we are going to have the Musaazi Memorial Lecture at Makerere University. You are all invited to listen to this lecture. Yes, there are many heroes of Independence in Uganda and Musaazi is one of those heroes and it was felt that a lecture should be held in his honour at Makerere University. We all know what Musaazi did in the struggle for the independence of our country.

Madam Speaker, one other commemorative event has been to recognise 50 company brands. This exercise was spearheaded by the Private Sector Foundation. Fifty vibrant companies were chosen by the public and were recognised and given awards on 16 August 2012 in a function officiated by the Prime Minister. 

There will be a state dinner for VIPs and invited guests on 8 October 2012 at State House Nakasero.

On 9 October 2012, on the D-Day, when we shall be 50 years old as an independent state, what is expected to be there? We expect to have the parade, as usual, and various floats. This event is being coordinated by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Co-operatives. The ministry will be liaising with the Private Sector Foundation, industrialists and others. 

There will be a 20-minute theatrical production by Alex Mukulu. There will be cultural and traditional performances, and renowned Ugandan music artistes will also perform. 

We are also preparing a list of renowned Ugandans who are going to be recognised and mentioned on that important day for the work they have done for this country. 

Many state visitors have been invited - those from outside the country and of course we, Ugandans, are invited. Let me mention the state visitors; 44 invitations were sent out to African Union heads of state and government, to the Queen of England, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the President of the United States, the President of the People’s Republic of China and the head of state of the Palestine National Authority. The heads of international bodies, regional and economic communities, the African Union and regional banks were also invited. Special guests, including His Highness the Aga Khan and Prince Fumulito of Japan, were also invited.

Twenty-four delegations have confirmed their attendance and they are:

Heads of State
•	H.E. President Yani Boni of Benin 
•	President Yahaya Jammeh of Gambia 
•	President Joyce Banda of Malawi 
•	President Paul Kagame of Rwanda 
•	President Salva Kiir of South Sudan 
•	President Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania 
•	President Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi 
•	President Joseph Kabange Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo 
•	President Mwai Kibaki of Kenya.
•	Regional Bodies
•	Prof. Ntumba Luaba, Executive Secretary of the Great Lakes body 
•	H.E. Tomaz Augusto Salomao, the Executive Secretary of SADC 
•	H.E. Dr Richard Sezibera, Secretary-General of the East African Community.

The ones below have delegated:

•	Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II delegated His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent, Prince Edward. You remember that Prince Edward was the same person who came here in 1962 at the time we gained our independence. Fifty years down the road he is coming to see how we have fared. (Applause)

•	President Hu Jintao of China has delegated the Vice Speaker of Parliament (Chinese People’s Congress).

•	President Jacob Zuma of South Africa has delegated a senior government official.

•	Mr Emmanuel Barraso of the European Union has delegated the head of the European Union in Kampala to stand in for him. 

•	President Barack Obama has delegated the US Ambassador in Uganda.

•	President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria has delegated the Vice-President, H.E. Nanadi Sambo.
•	President Omar Bashir of Sudan has delegated the Vice-President. 

•	Mr Ban Ki Moon, Secretary-General of the UN, has delegated a representative.

•	Mr Donald Kaberuka of ADB has delegated Mr Youssouf Ouedraogo.

•	Mr Kamalesh Sharma, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, delegated Mrs Masiremwaba, Deputy Secretary-General.

•	President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola has delegated someone.

•	President Michael Sata of Zambia has also delegated someone.

Madam Speaker, there are a few issues for clarification. Some of the billboards that have been displayed indicate the NRM and so on. (Laughter) Yes, there is a reason for this; billboards were left to the private sector just because of budgetary constraints. All that these people who wanted to put up billboards had to do was to come and say, “We want to put up a billboard in commemoration of the 50th anniversary celebration” and they were given a go-ahead. They just put the logo and put a message in commemoration of 50 years and some of them put NRM, but it was not an NRM arrangement.

As part of the commemorations, it was planned that we should have four secondary schools built – one in every region of Uganda that existed in 1962. We expected these schools to be on the ground and for them to be ready come 9 October 2012. Unfortunately, due to budgetary constraints, we were not able to construct these schools. However, we have talked with the Minister of Finance and Cabinet has decided that money will be raised in the subsequent years so that the schools are built as part of the memory of the 50 years.

Phase II of Kololo Ceremonial Grounds will also be completed. The budget allowing, we shall go ahead until all these plans are completed so that at the most, the Independence Day celebrations of 2015 will be conducted in a completed ceremonial ground and our schools will also be on the ground.

The Indians of Ugandan origin in the Diaspora will also be here to celebrate the 50 years of our independence. They are going to have a big do here during the celebrations. After that, I think around 11th October they will hold a trade conference with the Ugandans.

Madam Speaker, there was some disquiet in the press about the authorship of the jubilee song. The jubilee song was indeed composed by Ugandan artistes. The national organising committee went ahead and looked at the various compositions and chose one of them. So, the disquiet is really between the various artistes’ groups which worked together to produce this jubilee song.

There was also some concern, which I have not recorded here, about the political parties, particularly those old political parties which were in Uganda in 1962 - the Democratic Party and the UPC. They worked very hard during that independence exercise and they were saying they have not been involved in the arrangements. We took that very seriously and said, yes, it is true they also have a stake and they have sweet memories of the struggles they went through to bring about this independence - (Ms Nambooze rose_)- I am about to end.

THE SPEAKER: Let him finish. 

MR MURULI MUKASA: Honourable members, let me just finish. So-

THE SPEAKER: Why don’t you allow the minister to finish? I think he is explaining all his arrangements.

MR MURULI MUKASA: I am sorry, Madam Speaker, that what I am actually explaining now was not recorded. It is because this statement came to Parliament a little bit earlier. However, what I want to say is that yes, after we received that, I contacted the chairman of the party co-operation to make sure that all these wonderful views and opinions they have could be gathered and forwarded to the national organising committee so that they can be included. 

The national organising committee is meeting from tomorrow and in the subsequent days it will be meeting certainly everybody. Every good idea will be accommodated. Let us go together and make this celebration very wonderful. It is a milestone celebration. It is 50 years of age and it is a threshold to some other 50 years of development. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable minister, I want to thank you. We shall comment on this matter for only 15 minutes. I have two questions: One, it has been the tradition of Parliament to hold the National Prayer Breakfast every 8th October. Now I see that other offices are organising and will be targeting the same guests and yet we are really in advanced stages. So, we need to synchronise where the prayer will be. I do not think we should have two prayer ceremonies on the same day with the same people. 

The second one is that over the weekend, I ran into some chairpersons of districts and they asked me, “Do we come to Kampala or do we remain in our districts?”

Let us have comments; half a minute each.

5.49
MR RAPHAEL MAGYEZI (NRM, Igara County West, Bushenyi): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I would like to thank the honourable minister for his statement. I have listened very carefully - public lecture at Serena, prayer breakfast at Serena, cultural evening and exhibition is already going on at Serena, festivals in Kampala, dinner in Munyonyo, billboards in Kampala, carnival for the people of Kampala, women’s week in Africana, the Chinese are coming to Kampala and the Indians will be here. (Laughter)  

As I listened I was very disappointed. We come here and we sit here to represent a multitude of people in the villages and in the sub-counties where this independence makes meaning. I am looking at our gallant visitors here in the gallery - (Member timed out)

THE SPEAKER: Okay, one minute, hon. Magyezi. He is saying very important things for Kamuli. (Laughter)    

MR MAGYEZI: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am wondering what type of message they are taking back home. What are the people of Uganda going to celebrate? Where are the districts? Where are the sub-counties? I have just talked to a number of CAOs and district chairpersons; they are totally out of the arrangements. Even the one programme they have been given, the tree planting, it is actually the RDCs in charge, and it is only just 20 districts out of 120. 

Madam Speaker, I think this Parliament should make a resolution to request the honourable minister to come back tomorrow with a programme for the celebrations for the districts, ensuring adequate funding of not less than Shs 5.0 million for each district for their celebrations of Independence Day. Otherwise, it is only Kampala. It is as if Uganda has collapsed into Kampala and we are celebrating the independence of Kampala. (Member timed out)

5.51
MR IDDI ISABIRYE (NRM, Bunya County South, Mayuge): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I also want to thank the minister for this update. This is a very important day, where we need all Ugandans to feel that Uganda is celebrating 50 years of independence. However, having looked at the number of activities that the minister has submitted, the activities do not reflect the Uganda we want. 

The only reflection that Uganda has is just a few districts that have been selected to receive the trees, and the minister has told us that the communication has already gone to the districts. We are all representatives from districts but we are just learning about it from here that some districts are going to receive these tree seedlings. (Member timed out)

5.53
MS CONNIE NAKAYENZE (NRM, Woman Representative, Mbale): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to thank the minister for the presentation. My concern is, the whole of this week we have had a Parliamentary Week but I have not seen it included in this report. Yesterday, we had activities - we had netball, we had football - but they are not reflected in the minister’s report. We launched the Parliamentary Studies Institute but it is not indicated anywhere. So, I do not know whether the minister was not aware of what was taking place in Parliament. I would like to know that. (Member timed out)

5.54
MR REMIGIO ACHIA (NRM, Pian County, Nakapiripirit): Thank you, Madam Speaker, I think we are more disorganised 50 years after getting independence compared to 1962. Many people who were from all over Uganda who came to Kololo to celebrate getting independence from the British are here but 50 years later, nothing is happening around the country to remember this day. 

Two, the minister has not told us about foreign missions abroad. What is happening to foreign missions abroad? Are we celebrating our 50 years in foreign missions? Where are the materials for this jubilee? Where is the face of Uganda in other countries? 

The minister came to us and asked from this Parliament Shs 20 billion to modernise that place. As we talk now, I am not sure that she is worth Shs 20 billion and they are still plucking grass and planting it somewhere else. (Member timed out.) 

5.55
MS ROSE AKOL (NRM, Woman Representative, Bukedea): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I want to thank the minister for his detailed statement. I just want to comment on the issue of tree planting. When you move around this country, with this opportunity I believe there are certain districts which should not have missed on this list, and those are the districts of Manafwa, Sironko, Bulambuli, the Karamoja region, Bukedea and Kumi. This is because of climate change issues and environmental degradation. 
I do not know whether the minister saw NTV when they showed a lady in Bugisu region burning jerry cans in order to cook food. That was Manafwa. In Bukedea, I have a sub-county where people sleep hungry not because they do not have food but because there is no firewood. So, I am requesting you to amend that list and include these districts. (Member timed out)

5.56
MS EVELYNE ANITE (NRM, Youth Representative): Thank you, Madam Speaker, for giving me this opportunity. I want to first of all thank hon. Okupa for reminding and awakening Government to realise that they are supposed to make this statement. Honourable minister, thank you for responding to the call of hon. Okupa.

I have listened to the speech of the minister and he says that due to financial constraints, Government has not been able to put up billboards at Kololo. Madam Speaker, just like you helped Parliament and put up photos of leaders who have led this country since 1962 - We admit Government does not have the money because NRM, which has the money, has been in position to put photos and billboards there and then, there are political parties which truly did not have the money. 

Can we just kindly find out from the minister if he can allow, since they cannot also afford to put billboards, to just hang the photos of all the leaders we have had since 1962? Some of us who were born in this regime have not seen any other President; we need to see those presidents. Actually, I only got to see some of these presidents when their photos were hung up there – (Member timed out.)

THE SPEAKER: They are part of the 50 years.

5.58
MR AMOS OKOT (NRM, Agago County, Agago): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I request the minister to borrow from what we did during the IPU Conference where we involved our children during the celebrations, since after 50 years some of us may not be here. If these children are involved, it is going to be a more historical event because they will live to tell a story. During IPU, we involved the pupils who were the best in the national musical festivals. At this point, the minister can also involve our children in these celebrations so that we can go a long way in preserving history.

Just like he was putting across, some of the leaders picked the flag from the British, like Dr A. Milton Obote. If his name appears on the list they are going to present, I think we shall be more nationalistic than toeing a forced party line. However – (Member timed out.) 

5.59
MR NELSON SABILA (NRM, Kongasis County, Bukwo): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to thank the minister for the report. However, we feel that Uganda at 50 should be reflected down there in the sub-counties as one of the members has already remarked. All the activities to be carried out at the national level should also be reflected down there. We should have functions there so that the common man knows that this is Uganda at 50. 

The other issue is that when giving commemoration medals, it is important that even the Members of the Ninth Parliament who are hosting Uganda at 50 are given medals, starting from our Speaker. We hope that one is on the list.

The other one is the issue of trees. I do not know what criterion was used to arrive at the 24 districts in which trees will be planted. We expected at least areas which are hard hit by climate change to be first on the list of those getting trees so that environmental change becomes significant. Thank you.  

6.00
MR BAKER SSALI (NRM, Buikwe County West, Buikwe): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I heard the minister mentioning documentaries which are going to be shown around Kampala. I request that those documentaries be availed to us. Some of us have projectors and we can show the documentaries to our people so that they appreciate what happened and what is happening in Uganda. It would be prudent to take these programmes to our districts or constituencies so that those people, like the people of Kamuli whom you have brought here, - (Member timed out.)

6.02
MS SARAH KAYAGI (NRM, Woman Representative, Manafwa): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I will start with the prayer breakfast. Parliament has organised a prayer breakfast at Hotel Africana on 8th October. The First Lady has also organised thanksgiving prayers on the same day at Serena. When you look at the image of the First Lady and Parliament, we are likely to have invited the same people. So, I am wondering, which one do we attend? - (Interjections) - I kindly appeal to the minister to sit down with his colleague and reconsider. 

On the issue of celebrations on the 9th, if our celebrations in the districts are on, as Members of Parliament we shall all run back to celebrate with our people. I am appealing to the minister to postpone the district celebrations so that all Members of Parliament – (Applause) - turn up for the national celebrations. (Member timed out.)

THE SPEAKER: Okay, half a minute for our goal scorer. By the way, I forgot to tell you that we did very well yesterday although we lost. She was our best scorer in netball, and that is part of the celebrations which the minister forgot. 

MS KAYAGI: Thank you, Madam Speaker, and I want to thank you for participating and being a centre player, the best one at that. 

Lastly, I am so surprised; how do you leave out Manafwa and Bulambuli? These are districts which have got cracks everywhere. We need trees more than any other place in this country because of the landslides we are having. Honourable minister, please adjust your list and put Manafwa, Bulambuli and those lower ends where floods are sweeping the soil away. Please help us and bring us on board. I thank you.

6.04
MR RICHARD TODWONG (NRM, Nwoya County, Nwoya): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am a little schooled in diplomatic areas. When I see that we invited His Excellency Barack Obama and he is delegating the US Ambassador in Uganda, it makes me want to seek a little clarification because when you invite political leadership rarely do they send civil servants to represent them. 

Two, I see there is the Indians in the Diaspora Association Conference; I wonder whether Ugandans in the Diaspora are equally incorporated into the association. 

My last contribution is that in Northern Uganda, we celebrate Independence Day more than even Christmas. I kindly request to know whether the districts will also have celebrations on the same day; or will you postpone the district celebrations so that we can all attend the national celebrations? Thank you.

6.05
MR EMMANUEL DOMBO (NRM, Bunyole County East, Butaleja): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I had the opportunity to travel to Ghana about five years ago when they were celebrating their Independence Anniversary, and they capped it when they hosted the African Cup of Nations that same year. To them, the celebration of the day was the climax but it was preceded by other celebrations in other areas in a build-up to the celebration on the day, which was at the central headquarters. So, could the country do the reverse so that we launch the celebrations in Kampala but progressively celebrate in other areas, to let the people of Uganda know what Independence is? 

You recall that one time I raised an issue on the Floor of the House when the President travelled and won an accolade because of his fight against AIDS. When he returned, at the airport he was received by some people who gave him banana leaves. I said it was fine to give banana leaves, but let us learn the culture of respecting the Uganda flag – (Member timed out.)

THE SPEAKER: Half a minute for the commissioner.

MR DOMBO: When we were in Ghana, every vehicle, every house and every Ghanaian was flying the Ghanaian flag. So, what plans do we have on that day? As we launch patriotism and celebrate, what arrangements do we have? Can we launch the celebrations but progressively celebrate throughout the whole year as we commemorate our independence? (Member timed out)

6.07
MR JOHN SSIMBWA (NRM, Makindye Division East, Kampala): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I have three points to make. One is on the involvement of school children at primary, secondary and tertiary institutions level. We are talking about patriotism and I think this is the time to involve our children in order to instill in them a sense of nationalism. 

Secondly, Government always gives awards to companies that cannot afford to do these subsidiary activities, for instance when you talk about documentary production, jubilee production and others. This time round, I stress that the national organising committee, through the Minister for the Presidency, addresses this issue.

The other matter concerns the Inspector-General of Police who stopped public meetings and it is during these meetings that we as politicians – (Member timed out.)

MR TOM ALERO AZA (NRM, West Moyo County, Moyo): Madam Speaker, I have two observations to make. One, Moyo District was affected by the influx of refugees from Sudan and, therefore, I would be very happy if the tree planting process is also taken to Moyo District.

Secondly, there are very many of us in this House who are now 50 years old. I would be very happy if we could be recognised tomorrow also. Those members who are 50 years old should come and register with me so that we can be recognised. (Laughter)

6.09
MS HARRIET NTABAZI (NRM, Woman Representative, Bundibugyo): Thank you, Madam Speaker. Mine is a simple one. I have gone through the presentation but I have not seen the core theme of the day. What is the theme of the day and what are the districts going to learn from this?

Secondly, on most of these functions, we have always had problems from the Opposition. How has government prepared the Opposition not to walk to work on that day? In most cases, when we are carrying out government activities, they are on the road walking to work, involving the police and confusing our visitors. (Member timed out)

6.10
MS OLIVIA KABAALE (NRM, Woman Representative, Iganga): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I have two concerns. We want transparency. The minister said that due to financial constraints, they were not able to unveil the four schools to be built in line with the regions which existed when we got independence. I request that when you are bringing more information tomorrow, you tell us the schools so that we get that clearly.

My second concern is that Uganda is an agricultural country and so the minister should tell us what message the country has for the farmers. Thank you. 

6.11
MR MIKE MUKULA (NRM, Soroti Municipality, Soroti): Madam Speaker, who is also the “golden Speaker”, let me say that I welcome the brief from the minister. On the issue of transport, rather than getting Members of Parliament move in various vehicles, can’t we have centralised bus movements from here under escorts of Parliament to the venue? (Applause) That should also be done for ministers, the PSs and all these other people to avoid congestion at the parking place. 

Secondly, on the eve of 9th October, at mid-night, we could have fireworks in the country. (Applause) It is very important that this is marked. 

Furthermore, the man who raised the Uganda flag in 1962 is still alive. We could honour him again and bring him to come and raise our flag and mark that day. (Applause) 

6.12
MR GABRIEL AJEDRA (NRM, Arua Municipality, Arua): Madam Speaker, I thank you very much for giving me this opportunity. First of all, I want to thank the minister for giving us this brief. Just picking from what my colleague has said, the gentleman who designed the flag is actually in my constituency; he is alive. I think it would be good to honour him on that particular day. 

Secondly, on the issue of tree planting, I think the budget which has been allocated per district is very little. Madam Speaker, I am 50 years old; I celebrated my birthday about a month ago and I took it upon myself to plant trees as part of that celebration. I have been able to plant 2,160 trees as part of the celebrations. (Member timed out.)

6.14
MR PAUL MWIRU (FDC, Jinja Municipality East, Jinja): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I seek clarification from the minister in as far as project implementation is concerned. Money appropriated by Parliament is governed by PPDA. Here it is stated that the Office of the President signed a memorandum with UPDF, and the Ministry of Defence contracted Medallion to execute the project with UPDF engineers providing labour and close supervision. From the pace at which these works are moving and the money which the minister has been commenting on, everything seems to be behind schedule. Uganda has been associated with having activities and later we end up with scandals. From the way this contracting was done, there was subcontracting which Government seems not have control over. So, what guarantee do we have that actually after this, we shall not end up with the same scandals?

Secondly, it said that parties were allowed to erect party billboards at the venue. May we know the procedure because we had also intended to erect ours? (Member timed out) 

6.15
MS BETTY AMONGI (UPC, Oyam County South, Oyam): I thank you, Madam Speaker. The minister has stated that the billboards do not indicate other former presidents or history because they are sponsored by the private sector. I want to know from the minister - we in UPC honour the founder member of our Independence, Dr Apollo Milton Obote. There are people on that Front Bench and in this country, who would not be where they are if Dr Obote did not do what he did for this country. [HON. MEMBER: “All of them.”] Many of us studied in single sex schools initiated by the government of Obote I. I want to know the procedure to follow by some of us who want to sponsor a billboard in recognition of Dr Obote. Whom should we contact? Give us the contact because we want a billboard depicting Dr Apollo Milton Obote who –(Member timed out.)     

6.16
MS RONAH NINSIIMA (Independent, Woman Representative, Kabale): I thank you, Madam Speaker, for this opportunity. I want to caution our minister on the attire of the day. Can he tell us what kind of attire will be adorned? If at all it is there, can it be attire that is neutral so that members of the other parties do not see T-shirts written on “Fifth term” –(Interjections) 

THE SPEAKER: Order! Members. Please listen to these important issues.

MS NINSIIMA: We do not want a situation where other party members attend the function and they see attire written on “Fifth term” and they are distracted. I experienced this on the Youth Day in Kabale, where hon. Jack Sabiiti refused to come and explained that he did not want to come to a national function which was being turned into a one-party function. Indeed, what he predicted is what happened. When people came with T-shirts depicting one party, members of other parties left the function –(Member timed out.)

6.17
MR PARTICK NSANJA (Independent, Ntenjeru County South, Kayunga): Madam Speaker, mine is on page 5, under “Commemoration Book: 1962 – 2012” where the minister says that the book depicts Uganda’s modern history since Independence. We should not only include the good events, but also recognise other events like the one of the Black Mambas at the High Court where the temple of justice was “raped”.

Secondly, we also have to include the attack on the Kabaka’s Palace in 1966. It is also important to note. Thirdly, the massacre of the people in Northern Uganda. 

We also have the issue of Kiprotich, our medalist. What is also important to note is that with Uganda at 50, we have to pray for the Uganda Cranes –(Member timed out.)    

6.19
MS PHYLIS CHEMUTAI (NRM, Woman Representative, Kapchorwa): I thank you, Madam Speaker. My concern is about tree planting. Some time back, I read a report made by the meteorological department whichnoted  that rainfall was going to continue up to January and, therefore, I see no reason why Government should fear to continue planting of trees. 

In Kapchorwa, we have heavy rains at the moment, and I feel that this is the right time for me to plant those trees. I request the minister to consider Kapchorwa as one of the districts that has landslides so that we plant trees there during this rainy season.

I also want to know from the minister whether he has considered inviting traditional dancers from Kapchorwa, the district of the gold medalist. That is what I request for. (Member timed out.)

6.20
MR LATIF SSEBAGALA (DP, Kawempe Division North, Kampala): I thank you, Madam Speaker. I believe and we must agree that we are ill-prepared. We did not make enough preparations, as if we did not know that we were going to celebrate 50 years of Independence. 

However, on the issue of national thanksgiving prayers – I will appeal to the minister that thanksgiving prayers should not be concentrated at Serena Hotel. You should engage the religious leaders on Friday, Saturday and Sunday before the celebrations.

Lastly, the culture of prayer within us as Members of Parliament is wanting. On Monday, at the Imam, we had only 14 Members of Parliament who attended our prayers. So, I will appeal to you that whenever we are called upon for national or parliamentary prayers, let us turn up in big numbers. For God and my Country!

6.21
MR GILBERT OLANYA (Independent, Kilak County, Gulu): Honourable minister, looking at the cultural gala, you clearly indicated that a team of Chinese performers shall be performing during the gala, but you did not include any team from Uganda. This is the time Ugandans need to enjoy themselves. We have so many beautiful dances from Buganda, the Acholi Bwola Dance, the Laka-raka Dance, the Bugisu dance, Kadodi – you mention them. Therefore, let us give an opportunity to Ugandans to enjoy this day. 

Secondly, you talk of video documentaries. I would like to ask if you can avail Members of Parliament with the documentaries before the 9th of October because we need to see what messages were put in these documentaries –[HON. MEMBER: “Procedure.”]

THE SPEAKER: Point of procedure. Where is the minister? (Laughter) [HON. MEMBERS: “The minister is out.”] Are you are in charge? The Government Chief Whip is in charge?

6.22
THE GORVENMENT CHIEF WHIP (Ms Justine Lumumba): Madam Speaker and honourable members, I want to inform you that the minister got a call, and as Minister for Security, he had to step out, but I am taking note of what you are saying and when he returns, I will brief him. He is just in the lobby making a phone call. (Applause)

MR OLANYA: I would also like to know the procedure that the minister used in the selection of districts to benefit from the tree seedlings. Other districts are really in high need of tree planting.

Finally, the district –(Member timed out.)

6.23
MS BETTY NAMBOOZE (DP, Mukono Municipality, Mukono): I thank you, Madam Speaker. Please allow me to start by making a clarification about a report here that my district is benefitting from tree planting as a way of marking the –(Interruption) 

MR MWIRU: I thank you so much. I rise on a point of procedure. Our rules of procedure require that ministers attend the House to answer questions.

Secondly, when the Government Chief Whip told us that the minister received a call and yet the rules do not allow Members of Parliament to receive calls within the House, we need to put that record very clearly. Is it procedurally right for - how did he receive the call?

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Nambooze, please speak.

MS NAMBOOZE: I thank you, Madam Speaker. Through you, I want to inform this House that there is no tree planting taking place in my district as a way of marking the 50 years of Independence. It is not true information and I want to challenge the minister to prove that he has brought trees to Mukono, which are being planted.

Secondly, when you look at this report and you want to summarise it, the best words to use are that Uganda is not ready to celebrate the 50 years of Independence. We are not ready as a country, and it can be seen from this report. When you visit Kololo, you will see that we are not ready. 

The whole of this year should have been a celebration year. We should have started celebrations right from January, but you will find that up to now, even the theme is not known. It is not publicised. The Police have moved to ban all public rallies and meetings. (Member timed out.)

6.25
MR ELIJAH OKUPA (FDC, Kasilo County, Serere): Madam Speaker, I am disappointed, because basing on the minister’s statement on page 2, he says that the works are in final stages. When you look at this page, and he is saying that on Sunday it will be complete, I doubt given the weather that we have these days. 

Secondly, it is a disappointment that after budgeting – we started budgeting for these preparations two years ago. I am shocked that from the 18 schools that we had planned for, we reduced to four and then to zero. There is nothing to show for that. What a disappointment! 

Finally, I hope the government is going to recognise the contributions of Ugandans, especially Ugandan women, during these celebrations, for having elected the Woman Member of Parliament for Kamuli District as the first woman Speaker. Thank you. (Applause)

6.26
MS JALIA BINTU (NRM, Woman Representative, Masindi): Madam Speaker, I want to add to what hon. Okupa mentioned that in recognition of women’s participation, especially in the leadership of this country, the first woman Vice-President of Uganda and in Africa, Dr Specioza Kazibwe, should equally be recognised. I want also to add that we would be pleased – because the history of Uganda goes way back from Independence -all those leaders who acted as Presidents of this country should have billboards erected in their honour around the Kololo circuit and this should be the initiative of the government and not to leave it entirely to the private sector. Thank you very much.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable minister, I must register my disappointment that the government has chosen to ignore the contribution of Parliament. When we hosted the IPU here, we told you that was our contribution to the Golden Jubilee, but you have not mentioned it anywhere. It is as if nothing happened and yet it was one of the most successful conferences ever held in this country. You should acknowledge that. (Applause)   

This week, we held a charity walk to raise funds for the crested crane, one of our national symbols, but there is no mention about it. 

Yesterday, we played football with the generation of 1962; it is not mentioned anywhere. 

Tomorrow, we have invited the Members who are still alive from the first Parliament to come here and we are having a special sitting for them. All these you have not mentioned, and yet we have talked about this every day in this House. 

We are really disappointed with the way you are acting. Yesterday, we launched the Institute of Parliamentary Studies but there is no mention of it. I don’t know whether you are thinking about the Judiciary or you are also leaving them on their own. I think this is very disappointing, honourable minister. You can now answer. (Laughter) 

6.28
THE MINISTER FOR SECURITY (Mr Wilson Muruli Mukasa): Madam Speaker, let me begin with a very sincere apology to Parliament and the Rt Hon. Speaker for failing to recognise, in my speech, the effort of Parliament in celebrating the 50 years of our Independence. My very sincere apologies; this was just an oversight. We sincerely apologise.

However, I am very glad and happy that Members of Parliament have shown interest in this subject and have given very important and very good proposals as to how we can make this event very colourful, good and vibrant, and how to make it all inclusive for the rest of the country as we celebrate the 50 years of our Independence. 

On the question of synchronising the prayer by Parliament and the one that has been organised at Serena, that is taken note of. In due course, the National Organising Committee will definitely come up with a way forward on how this event will be organised. 

Madam Speaker, it was initially planned that the districts would hold the celebrations on the same day. The message of His Excellency the President would be taken to the districts and the Resident District Commissioners would be the chief celebrants –(Interjections)- that was planned initially. However, we have got –(Interruption)

MS KABAALE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Given the previous organisation that the minister has told us, the tree planting programme has been organised without the knowledge of Members of Parliament. In addition to that, the minister is saying that the national celebrations will proceed on that very day. I don’t want to object to the President’s call, but you find that there is a conflict in such a situation. 

When we are not in our constituencies during such celebrations, the people who officiate at the functions portray to the public that the Members of Parliament have ignored their constituencies. When Members of Parliament were calling upon the minister to postpone the celebrations so that we can interact with our people and inform them about the value of 50 years of Uganda’s existence, I think it was a good gesture. 

I seek guidance from you, Madam Speaker. Should we avoid the national celebrations and go for our district celebrations or is there a way we can harmonise them? Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, this is a national function which should involve everybody. We are expected at Kololo. So, the minister should postpone the district celebrations so that Members can go there later. (Applause) They will have to make a choice to either drive at night to Bundibugyo, maybe get an accident because they are trying to get to Bundibugyo. I don’t think you are being fair to us. After attending the prayer breakfast here, and then you run in the night! And even those RDCs, I think they want to come here; even the chairpersons would want to come. It’s a once in a life-time opportunity. Anyway, it’s your business.

MR MURULI MUKASA: Madam Speaker, I was going to continue and explain –(Interruption)

MS ANITE: Madam Speaker, the minister did apologise and I believe as a humble and good leader, you have taken his apology. But to me, I don’t think that apology is enough. It is just not enough to say, “I am sorry that I have omitted all that you have done as Parliament” and, therefore, we should say, “It is okay.” I cannot say it is okay. As Members of Parliament, it took us time. Madam Speaker, these activities you have been organising have been very early in the morning. We have had to leave home – Madam Speaker, in my condition - I had to wake up very early in the morning to come and attend this prayer breakfast and even leave my husband - you know I am a Mugole. (Laughter) So, if all this effort is not recognised – in IPU I also did the same thing; ran after cars and did a lot of work. 

I really feel that the minister should put this on record, for future Hansard readers that Parliament, under your leadership, did something very commendable. Thank you.

MR MURULI: Madam Speaker, with your indulgence, that will be certainly known that Parliament did a very commendable job in commemorating the 50 years. I hope that will be noted.

And, Madam Speaker, with your indulgence, we could present another statement for the record that will include the very commendable work that Parliament has done in commemorating the 50 years.

On the question of holding the district celebrations on the same day, I would like to request that I go back to consult the National Organising Committee together with Public Service before I come back to you. Anyhow, I would like to inform you that I have taken note of concerns because I know the technicalities involved in Members of Parliament not being in their districts during this celebrations. So, we can come back and make the situation quite clear.

MS NAMBOOZE: Madam Speaker, the minister has apologised for having brought here a report that does not indicate the activities that were undertaken by Parliament in celebrating 50 years of Independence. He has also indicated that he needs to go back and consult in order to solve the problem of having the district celebrations held on the same day with those at national level, and in harmonising the programme.

In the circumstances, therefore, wouldn’t it be procedurally okay for us to release the minister to report back with a new and comprehensive report for debate by this House? Wouldn’t that be procedurally okay since we are debating 50 years of Independence tomorrow?

THE SPEAKER: I think he had already offered to come back with a comprehensive statement, but really –(Laughter)– please come back with a comprehensive statement including, for example, what the Judiciary is doing, so that we can get to know that the whole country is celebrating and not just the Executive. Thank you. Next item, please. Yes, Minister of Finance, how about taxation. But will you be here tomorrow because we have a sitting and Members want to know how they can erect the billboards of their leaders –

MR MURULI: Madam Speaker, I think the question of whether we can postpone district celebrations or not, needs a little bit of more time because we have to consult Cabinet and it may take a bit of time for the Cabinet to assemble. So, it may not be possible for me to come up with a statement tomorrow.

THE SPEAKER: What about the issue of the billboards? They want to know how to contact you so that they can bring their billboards to Kololo.

MR MURULI: You mean the billboards? Yes, on the billboards we said –(Interjections)– even past leaders; there is no problem. No, this is an item that was given to the private sector because of budgetary constraints. So, really, what we can do –

THE SPEAKER: No, honourable minister, I think what the Members are saying, maybe in not so many words, is that this is a national celebration of our history. So, they want that history depicted. They want you to show what Uganda has gone through. You, know what they are asking for.

MR MURULI: Well, we like our past leaders because they have been our leaders in this country. Yes, this is something I shall present to the national organising committee and – (Interruptions)

DR BARYOMUNSI: Madam Speaker, I am seeking a clarification from the minister. This House voted money to the tune of Shs 20 billion to facilitate those activities. So, are you telling us that in your wisdom, you didn’t think that raising portraits to capture our past leaders wasn’t a priority for this kind of celebration? In other words, can’t you really raise those portraits of former Presidents: Dr Milton Obote, Gen. Idi Amin Dada and all the other past leaders? Are you saying that is not a priority?

THE SPEAKER: Yes, even those of Gen. Tito Okello, Nyamukyonkyo, Wacha Olwol, Sir Edward Muteesa and Sir Edward Nadiope, the former Vice President of Uganda. (Laughter)

MR MURULI: Madam Speaker, that point is noted and we shall comply. I can say that at the appropriate time, those portraits of past leaders will be put in place. Thank you. That is an assurance; it will be done.
 
Madam Speaker, on the question of tree planting, I would like to say that yes, a few districts have been mentioned here. But we said that all the districts in the country would be covered. The exercise was kick-started and will continue, and all the districts including Bulambuli, Manafwa, Bududa and all the other Elgon sub-region districts plus all those other districts in Bukedea and so forth, where trees are now very scarce. I promise they will be covered because it is in the plan.

Let me also say that foreign missions are expected to celebrate 50 years of Independence –(Interruptions)

MR MAGYEZI: Thank you, honourable minister. I am seeking clarification on the issue of the tree planting exercise. You have just told us that all the districts will eventually be brought on board. The question I am raising is: When will this be done? I am asking this because earlier you said that the rest of the districts will be brought on board next year. But somebody has just clarified that according to the weather forecast the rains will be going on up to January. So, can we be assured that as part of the Independence celebrations, my district of Bushenyi will also be brought on board, in terms of this tree planting project.

But we also asked: How many trees - because Shs 500,000 for tree planting is really paltry. If that is for mobilisation, could you tell us what we should expect for each district and when? Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: But honourable members, I thought the minister has said that he is going to come back to the House with a comprehensive statement so that we can get all the answers. So, let us not do it piecemeal; let us go to the taxation. Minister, when you return, make sure you bring all those answers. 

6.43
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PLANNING (Mr Matia Kasaija): Madam Speaker and dear colleagues, I am here to present a statement on the taxation of reproductive health products as I promised to do, about two weeks ago.

I wish to reiterate that it is a Government policy to provide a favourable tax regime for the health sector. Accordingly, there has been a deliberate effort to ensure that all tax laws reflect this tang as illustrated below: 

1.	The VAT Act

The tax provides for the exemption of medical supplies in the Second Schedule and zero-rating of medical supplies in the Third Schedule as follow:

(a)	Second Schedule - Exempt Supplies
 
i.	1(h) the supply of veterinary, medical, dental and nursing services.
ii.	1(q) the supply of dental, medical, veterinary equipment and ambulances.
iii.	1(bb) the supply of contraceptives, sheaths and examination gloves.

b)	The Third Schedule - Zero-Rated Supplies
 
i.	1(c) The supply of drugs and medicines.
ii.	1(j) The supply of sanitary towels and tampons, and inputs for their manufacture.

In a nutshell, what we mean is that reproductive control products, particularly the contraceptives, are supposed to be both Duty and VAT exempted. For clarity, all contraceptives will henceforth be categorised in the same class as medicines for VAT purposes by issuance of a Practice Notice by URA.

I wish to lay before this Parliament the relevant section of the VAT Act, which I have referred to above.

2.	The East African Community Common External Tariff

The East African Community Common External Tariff provides for zero Import Duty on medical supplies as follows:

a)	Chapter 30, pharmaceutical products including contraceptives. 
b) 	Chapter 90, Specialised Medical Equipment.
c) 	Chapter 94, Medical and Surgical Equipment.

I wish to also lay on Table the relevant section of the East African Community Common External Tariff.

3.	The East African Community Customs Management Act Exemption Regime

Under the East African Community Customs Management Act Exemption Regime, Fifth Schedule, the following medical supplies are exempt from Import Duty: 

(a) Diapers, urine bags and hygienic bags for medical use.

(b) Diagnostic reagents and equipment for use in hospitals, clinics and diagnostic laboratories.

(c) Any of the following goods engraved or printed or marked with the hospital logo imported for use in licenced hospitals: Shadowless lamps, kitchenware, laundry equipment, bedside screens, air conditioners and so forth.

I wish to lay on Table a copy of the relevant sections of the East African Customs Management Act as amended, July 2012.

It is, therefore, evident that the tax policy regime provides that contraceptives attract neither Import Duty nor VAT. Government will accordingly ensure that all contraceptives are exempted from Import Duty and VAT through clarification to the various stakeholders of the legal provisions, including issuance of what is called the Practice Notice by URA.

Similarly, in light of the government policy on tax treatment of medical supplies as illustrated above, Government will ensure that the Mama Kits are accorded the same tax treatment as other medical supplies. Indeed the goods, which were pending clearance in customs, have now been released to the owner without demanding any taxes at all. Madam Speaker, I wish to hand over.

6.49
MR ELIJAH OKUPA (FDC, Kasilo County, Serere): Thank you, Madam Speaker. Honourable minister, I think you would have started by apologising to the people who suffered the inconvenience.  You should have also categorically stated here that those who were assessed should be refunded that tax.

Under your statement here on page 2, Chapter 90 and 94 of the East African Community Common External Tariff, there are specialised medical or surgical equipment. One of those are the photographic plates for x-rays. I have a tax assessment here for one of the companies that imports and works with these medical equipment, who was assessed the tax. So, this falls under it. These are part of the items, which are supposed to be exempted, but they have been taxed. 

Can that tax be refunded? I am going to lay this tax assessment, which was done on 13 September 2012. We want to hear from you that these taxes will be refunded and any others associated to this should also be refunded.

I hear my colleague there saying, are they marked? They are very clear on what is supposed to be marked, if you look – 

So, I will not waste time to answer whether they are engraved or not because it is very clear what is supposed to be engraved and what should not. So, we want to hear from you. Apologise for this, refund the money and adhere to the tax laws.

6.51
DR CHRIS BARYOMUNSI (NRM, Kinkizi County East, Kanungu): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I thank the minister for the statement, but when you listen to the statement, it is as if the issues we brought here were a falsehood. He does not make reference to the statement to the media and the documents that were laid on the Table that there was a problem. He only states the position of the law as if nothing has been happening. Therefore, you should acknowledge that there was an error or that this tax was being imposed irregularly. 

When you read the last statement, it says, “Indeed the goods, which were pending clearance in Customs have been released.” When I received this document, I sent a message to the Executive Director of Reproductive Health Uganda whose contraceptives were being held and my question was, has URA released the consignment of contraceptives? The answer was, not yet. On the contrary, URA has now put sanctions against our clearing agents for not clearing our consignments for over three months.

So, I want to ask the minister whether he is in touch with URA. He is telling us one thing, but the reality on the ground is something different. So, can you be sincere to this House on whether by the time you prepared this statement you had liaised with Uganda Revenue Authority?

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I hope you remember what Mr Werunga told us yesterday when we were amending these things. These are the Bills I was talking about yesterday.

MR KAKOOZA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. The information I want to give to my colleague is, you know, sometimes when we are using the East African Community Customs Tariffs, the items are classified under a harmonised code. The moment you don’t classify them in that particular harmonised code - in the computers within the region and in Customs ASCUDA, when you classify it wrongly it captures and you pay tax. But when you classify it in the right code, it does not.

I want to give this information in view of what the minister has given, and I have the law here with me. Mama kits are classified under harmonised code 90.18. It says, “Instruments and appliances used in medical and surgical are described and classified under 90.1900.” According to what the petition was, they classified those ones under 36.060. In the computers of customs, it is a taxable item.  

THE SPEAKER: Who classified them?

MR KAKOOZA: The clearing agent. The only way out like the import duty in this code (East African Customs Tariffs) is you do not pay tax. What the minister is saying here is that contraceptives and orals do not pay VAT. So, it is a problem, but the only way they can do it is by the Ministry of Finance directing URA to release the items and use the practice notes, which are ordered within the law by the Minister of Finance.

MR OKUPA: Madam Speaker, what hon. Kakooza is stating could be the case. But as the clearing agent declares, it is captured. However, there is also physical verification, and during that exercise, you are able to determine with precision. So, that would be corrected; why didn’t they do that?

DR BARYOMUNSI: Madam Speaker, I laid here a lot of information, including letters from the Ministry of Health, complaining that there was no change in the classification of the items. And even the consignments which were being shipped in had clear labels showing that they were contraceptives with their specific names. It was just a deliberate decision taken by URA to pick out these items and it should be reversed. So, we would like the Minister of Finance to direct URA to stop forthwith and also the organisations which have paid the taxes should be refunded; and we want that assurance that they will be refunded that money.

6.57
MR JULIUS MAGANDA (Independent, Samia-Bugwe County South, Busia): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am contributing on the importation of goods that are exempt from paying tax. URA has a system which is now managed. Despite hon. Kakooza coming up with a better description on how the tariff sometimes dictates on particular importations, however, the current URA system does not even allow a clearing agent on the Ugandan side, despite discovering that there is a mistake on the classification for the system, to amend. 

They have already put conditions that for an amendment to be done it has to be passed by the Commissioner-General. And now, that one still takes us back to the description that hon. Baryomunsi says. The description of the commodity after verification can mandate an amendment to be done on spot, especially if this item is being imported for a purpose that is not meant for business – these are items imported to facilitate the health sector. (Member timed out.)

THE SPEAKER: Please conclude within half-a minute.

MR MAGANDA: What we ask the ministry is that since the importers had already notified the Ministry of Finance, this was basically an instrument that would have been issued and then the taxes would just be automatically exempt. We have come across these cases within the business system and it is being made. Let it be done at the national level that it is being imported for the support of the community and the health sector, and the problem will be sorted out. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

6.58
MR FRANK TUMWEBAZE (NRM, Kibale County, Kamwenge): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am seeking for clarification from the minister and maybe we would also follow it up. I am bothered about people who may wish to use this exemption to abuse the exemption on medical supplies for other purposes and we will lose revenue. Take an example of surgical spirit – I think it is used in the theatre; isn’t it, Dr Baryomunsi? But we use the same thing in the salon; when I have my beard cut, I need surgical spirit to be applied to prevent me from getting pimples. So, they divert this surgical spirit from being medical for a different commercial use. So, how does URA –(Interjection)– No, I have a reason for saying this. Look at sugar – it is taxable - but for companies that use it as input material for manufacturing it is given a tax exemption, but the sugar is escorted up to the factory. So, what similar arrangement can we apply to medical sundry that may not necessarily serve only one purpose of medical use?

MS SARAH KAYAGI (NRM, Woman Representative, Manafwa): Thank you, Madam Speaker. The minister has stated that he is going to ensure that the clarification is made to the various stakeholders as far as these taxes are concerned. I want the minister to state the timeframe when this communication is going to be passed on. This will avoid us from having a case like that of the Youth Fund, where they said without an O’Level certificate, the youth could get the loan, but when they go to the bank, the banks say the guidelines have not changed. So, when is the minister going to make this communication so that the Mama Kit will also be tax-free? Thank you.

MS OLIVIA KABAALE (NRM, Woman Representative, Iganga): Thank you, Madam Speaker. We thank the minister for helping our mothers to be saved through that clarification. But I would also wish to know using reference. Last week, we went to the Busia border as the Committee on East African Community. Some of us had to disguise ourselves to know how the tax system is operating there because we do not want to hear from rumours. Based on that, I would like to seek clarification from the minister whether these traders – regarding the way they informed us about how the URA officials treat them – whether you organise seminars to sensitise them. We cannot just assume that these traders know the procedures of taxation; if they are informed, these complaints will reduce because they will know which items are taxable and by what percentage -(Member timed out.)

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE (PLANNING) (Mr Matia Kasaija): Madam Speaker, I wish to thank colleagues for raising these issues. First of all, hon. Baryomunsi, I want to state categorically that the Mama Kits have been released. I do not know which officer you are dealing with; I have just got a note here saying, “Hon. Minister, the Mama Kits were released to their respective owners.” So, I do not know where you are getting that information, but mine is different from yours.

On medical sundries not being diverted for commercial use; hon. Tumwebaze asked how we can ensure that. That is a tricky one, but I think once goods have been classified as hon. Kakooza says “coded” and we have issued them – in any case, for the surgical spirit being used to avoid one from developing pimples is more or less for medical use. (Laughter) (Interruption)

MR OKUPA: Thank you, honourable minister for giving way. For the specific one which you have stated here, the laws are very clear – they are tax-exempt or zero-rated. So, there is no problem even if it is of dual-use. But for the cases like the example of sugar that he gave, which can be both a final product as well as a raw material, URA can use three different methods. For example, there is the apportionment method which can be used in order to arrive at the correct tax; if this was used as a final product and the other portion used as raw material, then the tax can be assessed. There are methods used to handle products which have two or more uses. 

MR KASAIJA: Thank you, hon. Okupa for that information. (Hon. Baryomunsi rose_) 

DR BARYOMUNSI: Thank you very much, honourable minister, for giving way. You were asking whether I have up-to-date information. When I laid documents on Table, I did say that one of the agencies, Reproductive Health Uganda, had two consignments of contraceptives - this time not Mama Kits. They paid Shs 14 million for the first consignment and it was delivered. There was another consignment taxed at Shs 36 million, which has not been released. That is the message which I read, that when I asked their management they said instead URA is penalising the clearing agent for not paying the taxes. So, it could be true the Mama Kits have been released, but the contraceptives by these agencies, including USAID, are still stuck with URA. So, you need to cross-check.

THE SPEAKER: Minister, please conclude.  

MR MATIA KASAIJA: Okay, I had taken this in the context of Mama Kits and not the contraceptives. I know what is happening to the contraceptives. All I want to assure this House is that when a tax is wrongly assessed you are supposed to be refunded. So, where a tax has been assessed wrongly, not in accordance with the law, definitely appropriate action will be taken.

When are we going to communicate to the stakeholders? Immediately! (Laughter) URA should begin. Yes, immediately! There is no need to wait because the law is very clear. We have clarified things so it is the job of the URA. Don’t worry Madam Speaker and colleagues; we shall tell URA to begin discussing this matter with the stakeholders. 

There is a whole department within URA about tax education - the traders - and for all I know it is very active. It may not be as active as many people would want, but I want to assure colleagues that we shall definitely push URA further on this tax education in case they are slackening, for the public to understand their tax obligations and everybody to know when and where to pay their taxes. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.   

THE SPEAKER: Now, honourable Minister of Finance, since we have done your work, can you commit to releasing the money for this quarter? (Laughter)

MR MATIA KASAIJA: Since my senior minister is here, Madam Speaker, may I ask her to come and make a comment on that?

THE SPEAKER: Yes, we want a commitment from the minister.   

7.07
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mrs Maria Kiwanuka): Madam Speaker, I have heard your instruction; I am your obedient servant.

THE SPEAKER: Okay, so that is a Government assurance. The money will be released forthwith.

Now, honourable members, I want to adjourn the House to 10 o’clock tomorrow, but as I informed you, we have a special sitting, and one of the people who has flown from Australia to be here is the first Speaker of this Parliament. He will be in the gallery tomorrow, together with very many others. So, 10 o’clock, and since they are old people, we do not want to keep them here for long. From 10.00 a.m. to 12.00 noon should be sufficient for them. Thank you very much. House adjourned to 10 o’clock tomorrow.

(The House rose at 7.08 p.m. and adjourned until Friday, 28 September 2012 at 10.00 a.m.)
