The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you to this morning sitting. I apologise for the inconvenience caused in making arrangements for us to be here when we are still under lockdown conditions but please, bear with us.

I would like to thank you, again, for completing the budget process. As we come to the end of the Third Meeting of the Fourth Session of the Tenth Parliament, there are a few Bills, loans and petitions that remain outstanding. I will be giving permission, on case by case basis, to particular committees to sit so that we do not congest the premises.

With respect to today’s proceedings, we would want, as much as possible, to do the work so that by 5.00 p.m., we are out of here not only because of the curfew but also to enable our colleagues in Ramadhan go home early.

Honourable members, I have heard that there are Members who would like to return the Shs 20 million. I would like to inform you that anyone who returns that money - we shall actually give it to your district. So, no money will remain here. (Applause) If you bring it, we shall take it to your district taskforce because it was given for that purpose. Thank you very much. 

I also have a petition from a teacher called Rwakabuga who claims that there are teachers in private institutions; they were the first to go on lockdown yet, they are paid each month. The worry is that they, who work in private schools, may not be paid. They want the Government to take an interest in this issue and ensure that teachers in private schools are also paid during this period.

I also want to congratulate and announce the nomination of hon. Anifa Kawooya, who was assigned by the Pan African Parliament to work on gender matters both at continental and inter-continental levels. She is a member of the Joint Bureau and Vice President of the Pan African Parliament Women’s Caucus, and the President of the Eastern Region Women’s Caucus and a member of the Committee on Gender, Family, Youth and Persons with Disabilities. You can count on us for support. (Applause)

Honourable members, the matters of national concern will come a bit later. Let us start with major business first.

MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT ON ALTERATION OF BOUNDARIES UNDER ARTICLE 179(1)(A) OF THE CONSTITUTION AND DECLARATION OF CITIES UNDER SECTION 7(2)(A) OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT CAP. 243

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I would like to remind you that this matter was partially handled in December. We had a sitting on 3rd December 2019 in which the motion was presented and the justification made. Debate ensued and what was remaining was for the House to take a vote. The matter then subsequently got adjourned to 5th December 2019 just to take a vote but on that day, some Members were present but when the Speaker checked, they were not sufficient to take a vote. He later suspended the House for a few minutes. 

However, when he came back, even those who had been there had left. Therefore, it was not possible for the House to vote. So, really the matter is for voting; it is not for debate.

12.10
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR ENERGY AND MINERAL DEVELOPMENT (Ms Sarah Opendi): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise on procedural matter. It is true this matter was introduced to the House last year. However, Madam Speaker, considering what is going on in the country and the decision by this House requesting the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to give us a detailed statement on the effects of COVID-19 on the economy, before we vote on this matter, wouldn’t it be procedurally right for us -(Interjections)- I am entitled -

THE SPEAKER: Order.

MS OPENDI: I rose on a procedural issue. Wouldn’t it be procedurally right for us to first receive a detailed statement on the effects of COVID-19 on this economy?

Secondly, I want to remind the House that there are town councils and sub counties that were created but up to now, we do not have money yet to operationalise them even in this year’s budget. Therefore, why are we now proceeding to pass cities, Madam Speaker?

Therefore, wouldn’t it be procedurally right for us to first hear from the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development on where the money for the sub counties and town councils is before we proceed to look at the cities? 

Madam Speaker, let us –(Interjections)– I am speaking as a Member of Parliament from Tororo and a minister in Government. I have not been attending Cabinet meetings and I do not know what has been discussed of late. 

Anyhow, sometimes, we have to do first things, first. If there is no money for town councils and sub counties, why should we move into cities? I wish we could first discuss this before we proceed. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, my understanding of the motion that was moved is that it is about either declaring cities or not but not the financing, at the moment. Let us ascertain the numbers first before we take a vote. 

Honourable members, we are required to have 50 per cent plus one. (Members rose_) We are ascertaining the numbers. Therefore, please, allow us to first ascertain the numbers. Take your seats.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, we are required to ascertain the numbers present so that when we take a vote, we are able to raise 50 per cent plus one. Therefore, give us a few minutes and the Clerk will tally the numbers present. 

Honourable members, the meeting is called to order. Can we invite all the Members to come back to the Plenary? Can you ring the bell? 

Honourable members, please, take your seats. As I indicated earlier, the motion for altering the boundaries for declaration of cities was moved in December. We have ascertained that there are 310 Members present today. We require 50 per cent plus one. 

Therefore, we are going to start voting by roll call. I am required under Rule 98(4) to close the doors and draw the bar. No Member shall either enter or leave the Plenary hall. I do not have doors to close today. I am just appealing that you remain here until the vote has been taken. Please, no coming in nor going out.

THE SPEAKER: Okay, honourable members, we shall call ten names at a time and Members will come and stand in a small queue.

2.34
MS JALIA BINTU (NRM, Woman Representative, Masindi): Thank you, Madam Speaker. Yes, you stated that this motion was debated way back last year - four months down the road now. However, allow me seek clarification from you on whether it is not necessary for the minister and the mover to take us through the summary of the motion to help us vote, knowing what we are voting on.

That is my prayer, Madam Speaker. 

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, just for clarity, the minister is going to read out the clusters before we start voting. Can I invite the minister to just make a synopsis?

2.40

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, we are improving on our capacity to use technology. However, we would like the votes that came in on Zoom and the votes that came in by phone to be recorded and then we also tally the votes that were taken here in the Plenary before we make our decision. Can you give me the tally of the Zoom votes, the telephone votes and then the physical votes here?

MR SSEGGONA: Madam Speaker, as I indicated earlier, I would like to seek your guidance. Members of Parliament from Wakiso and I have conferred with the minister and we would wish to seek your leave to amend and bring Wakiso and Entebbe closer to 2021. I would like to seek your guidance.

THE SPEAKER: No. Honourable members, I think we should be fair to the whole country. This is a part of the region in this country that has got more cities than others. Please, no amendment. Let us have the tally.

MR SSEGGONA: Madam Speaker, this concession was brokered by the Office of the Speaker. We had indicated that because the ministry had not sought a resolution from the district to incorporate some of the sub counties and town councils, the resolution was secured conditional to the two cities starting together. I would implore the patience of the House that fairness in this case would require us to stick to the concessions made with Government.

MR WALUSWAKA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. With pain, I would like to raise a point of order. Is it in order for a senior colleague, who is a lawyer by profession, to bring an amendment when we have already finished voting and the Clerk is tallying and doing the mathematics? 

Is it in order for hon. Sseggona to start confusing the Clerk, and indeed, the House, when we have already voted? Is he in order, when other regions like Bukedi do not have anything but we are painfully quiet? Is it in order for Wakiso, which is near Kampala and Entebbe – even Kampala is here – Is it in order for the Member to start confusing the Clerk when she is tallying? Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, there are issues of equity in this country. I really would like to appeal that we go with the motion as proposed by the minister. The minister came here and read them out and none of you said anything. We started voting and we have finished. Clerk, please, give us the tally.

MR JOSHUA ANYWARACH (Independent, Padyere County, Nebbi): Madam Speaker, I was here in the House in the Ninth Parliament when we passed very many administrative units to come into operation in phases and indeed, they came. The only area that we would ask you to pronounce yourself on is this - when, for example, Nebbi Municipality became operational, Government took one year to organise elections –

THE SPEAKER: Honourable member, let us finish with the vote on the cities. The minister is here; he will have to answer those questions. Let us take a vote on the cities first. Let us finish with that first.

The requirement was to get 50 per cent plus one. We have achieved it. As a result, the Ayes have it. Thank you very much. 

Honourable members, this is the tally: The total “Yes” votes were 325. Out of these, the physical votes were 313. One Member voted “No.” There was no abstention. We note the 12 telephone votes but they will not be added to the final tally. So, we will only deal with the 314 votes - the 313 who voted “Yes” and the one who voted “No”. Those are the total votes we have.

Honourable members, on the Order Paper, we have other motions but you will note that we have spent the whole day on this and each of those motions will have to be voted on independently. So, we want to find time and see how we can shorten the process. Otherwise, it will require us to take a week if we take one day on each of all these motions. 

Therefore, we want to look for time to see when we can do them. I will adjourn the House to Tuesday next week. However, from tomorrow up to Friday, the committees, which I will have allowed to work will carry out their tasks while we find a strategy to deal with these motions without sitting the entire day doing just one motion.

THE GOVERNMENT CHIEF WHIP (Ms Ruth Nankabirwa): Madam Speaker, I am standing here to sincerely thank you very much. You were here since morning and you have not left your seat. Some people broke off for some inevitable issues but you have been seated here since morning. I thank you very much. (Applause)

I would also like to thank members of Parliament for turning up in these numbers and also for doing the needful. Kindly, when the Speaker calls us again, let us turn up in these big numbers. These tents were put here for us and they are going to be paid for. Let us utilise them and finish the work.

I thought that I would air out this happiness and wish you a blessed evening and a happy Ramadhan. Thank you very much.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, we had agreed that we stop at 5.00 p.m. because of the curfew and Ramadhan. I know there were matters of national concern but if we delve into those, it would take us some time. However, I will note them and at the next sitting, I will give you an opportunity.

5.05
THE MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr Raphael Magyezi): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to join the Government Chief Whip in thanking you, the Members, the Leader of the Opposition and everybody for the big support. This has been a fundamental decision for the urbanisation and development of our country.

I would like to say that for the sake of Wakiso, the motion could not come now but it can come later on its own merit and we will consider and process it accordingly. I thank you, Madam Speaker, and I wish you a happy Ramadhan.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much. Honourable members, the House is adjourned to Tuesday next week. The committees will be informed. 

(The House rose at 5.06 p.m. and adjourned until Tuesday, 5 May 2020.)
