THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS INTERIM PROVISIONS BILL, 1995

MR OBWANGOR: Point of order.  Mr Chairman, according to our orders or dispatch or public business, apparently the House has no quorum because people are sick.  Are we in order to continue?  

DR TIBERONDWA: Mr Chairman, is it in order for us to continue debating this very important Bill without the Minister responsible in the House?

THE CHAIRMAN: It is not in order.  Therefore, I adjourn the Council until tomorrow at 2.30 p.m.  Thank you.

(The Council rose at 2.45 p.m. and adjourned until Wednesday, 24 January 1996.)
