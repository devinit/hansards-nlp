(The Speaker, Mr. Ayume Francis, in the Chair).
The House was called to order

FORMATION OF SESSIONAL COMMITTEES FOR THE FOURTH SESSION OF THE 6TH PARLIAMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 142 (I) AND (V) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE.

THE SPEAKER:   Hon. Members, the rules of procedure require the House to form Sessional Committees at the beginning of each Session in a manner described in rule 142 sub rule (1).  

The bulk of Parliamentary business is,  as you know, transacted in Committees before being reported to the Plenary for our collective decision.  

At the beginning of the Fourth Session of this Parliament, a number of Bills were given a first reading but were not referred to any Committees,  because they had not been formed.  Some business is coming in and more is anticipated.  There is, therefore, urgent need to constitute the Sessional Committees to enable Parliament to embark on its work in accordance with our rules of procedure.  

I have been advised that as per rules,  Members were requested to indicate the Committees on which they wish to serve and I am equally advised that most of you have done so.   Rule 142 sub rule (5) requires that the names of the members to serve on each Committee be approved by this House. I will now proceed to read the names of the Members on each Sessional Committee and ask whether you approve of them or not.  You can indicate your approval or disapproval in the usual way of aye or no.  Let me begin with Members of the Sessional Committee on Finance and Economic Development.

MR. AWORI:  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for granting me the opportunity of raising this procedural matter.  You are about to announce the names of various Members of the Sessional Committees and probably this will be followed by the election of their chairpersons.  But,  Mr. Speaker, among other things, you also referred to the matter of the rules governing elections.  

I learnt from the corridors of Parliament that at some stage, the rules of procedure were subjected to Amendment.  Has this been effected, Mr. Speaker?  And if so, will that affect the election of the chairpersons we are about to elect?  Have the rules been amended;  are they still intact?

MISS. BABIHUGA:  Thank you Mr. Speaker.  We are about to commence on constituting Sessional Committees and since we begun our term here, each of these Committees has been having a base in which to meet and deliberate and as far as I know, a lot of that room is either being renovated or has otherwise been converted to other business.  I am seeking clarification on where these Committees will be based in the circumstances pertaining.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

THE SPEAKER:  Let me start with the point of clarification which has just been made.  It is quite true that we are likely to have problems of the office space or meeting space, but I think we shall try our best to ensure that the business of Parliament,  and especially of the Committees,  is not disrupted on account of lack of space.  At least for today, when Members who will have been elected proceed to elect their chairpersons, I will try and indicate where in the premises they will transact that business.  For the long term problem, it is being addressed and you will be advised in due course.

Coming to hon. Awori's inquiry, I do not think that is a procedural matter.  But I will give him the benefit of doubt, although I think he was seeking clarification.  Yes, there was an exercise to amend our rules of procedure, that exercise is going on and when we get to a stage where we shall seek the approval of the House,  we will be involved in the decision making.  I would like to assure you that the exercise is going on.  

It is not to say, however, that until those rules are amended and approved, the House cannot transact business.  When you propose to change a law, you do not stop to obey the laws that are in existence.  You continue to obey the laws that are in existence until you change the law to suit the circumstances and the dictates of the change.  

I will now proceed to read the names of the Members of the Sessional Committee on Finance and Economic Development:

1.  Hon. Kikulukunyu Faisal Ssali
2.  Hon. Wagidoso Mabibo Charles

MR. MAO:  Mr. Speaker, I have heard some names of those who hold positions in the Movement Secretariat as Directors and I would like the clarification from the Chair whether it is compatible with the rules to have such persons serving on Committees.  Since we do not have Ministers on Committees, is it in order to have Movement Secretariat Directors - who are renumerated like Ministers - on our Committees?

THE SPEAKER:  It is in order.  Members on Sessional Committee on Tourism, Trade and Industry:

1.   Hon. Ofory Rugette Arthur
2.   Hon. Omongole Tom

MR. NABUTALA:  Thank you,  Mr. Speaker.  Part of my clarification has been sorted out.  According to rule 142, each Sessional Committee shall consist of not less than 15 Members.  Since we are 14, can we have one more Member to make 15?


THE SPEAKER:  Unless there is a volunteer, I cannot force anybody to be on that Committee. -(Mr. Kintu Musoke rose-).

             (Question put and agreed to).

We will take it that the first indication is where he really wanted to belong and therefore this will create a vacancy.  We should therefore delete the name of hon.

20.  Hon. Bitahwa
21.  Hon. Lukyamuzi Ken

(Question put and agreed to).

THE SPEAKER:  Members on the Sessional Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs covering the following Ministries:  Defence and Internal Affairs, Internal Security Organisation, External Security Organisation, Uganda Police Force, and Uganda Prisons Service.  

1.   Hon. Olum Zachary
2.   Hon. Maj. Tonny Otoa
3.   Hon. Kule Muranga Joseph

19.  Hon. Kimera Vincent, and;
20.  Hon. Onzima Alex  

MISS KABASHARIRA:  According to our rules of procedure, that Committee is supposed to handle,  apart from Defence and Internal Affairs, Internal Security Organisation and External Security Organisation.  But I have not heard it being read out, Mr. Speaker.

THE SPEAKER:  I read as follows: Members on the Sessional Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs covering the following, and it includes the two areas you have just mentioned hon. Member.  Is that alright?  Okay.  I now put the question.

(Question put and agreed to)

MR. KARUHANGA:  I rise on a point of information with regard to what hon. Kabasharira has just raised.  The Committee on Presidential and Foreign Affairs has traditionally handled the Office of the President, which  includes the Minister for Security who is in charge of the Security Agencies.  So  ESO and ISO have traditionally reported to the Committee on Presidential and Foreign Affairs.  That has always been the case.  

THE SPEAKER:  Yes if I remember well, there were complaints about the anomaly in the arrangement which you are talking about.  Maybe that is what has been intended to do,  namely,  to correct it.

MR. NJUBA:  Mr. Speaker I had enlisted for this Committee, but I did not hear my name,  yet I served on it very faithfully last year -(Laughter).

THE SPEAKER:  I now put the question.

(Question put and agreed to).

THE SPEAKER:  Finally hon. Members, we look at Members on the Sessional Committee on Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries covering the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries.  

1.   Hon. Kanyike Anthony
2.   Hon. Bantariza Francis
3.   Hon. Bigirwa Bernadette
4.   Hon. Lubega Waggwa
5.   Hon. Kityo Mutebi

20.  Hon. Kayizzi Asanasio
21.  Hon. Wandyaka. N. Moses
22.  Hon. Mpanga Joyce. R


MR. CHEBET MAIKUT:  Mr. Speaker, I also enlisted for this Committee.  I think it is by some mistake that my name is not appearing there.  Thank you. 

THE SPEAKER:  That is hon. Chebet Maikut.  I now put the question.

(Question put and agreed to).

THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Members, under rule 142  -(Interruption).

MR. TIM LWANGA:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  The Committee on Finance and Economic Development has got only 14 Members, it should be 15.  I wish to propose that hon. Matthew Rukikaire joins this team.

THE SPEAKER:  Well,  according to the list, I seem to have omitted the name of hon. Pascal Mukasa.  I had missed the updated list.  Is hon. Pascal Mukasa around?

MR. RUKIKAIRE:  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to propose that my name be added to this Committee -(Laughter).

THE SPEAKER:  The hon. Matthew Rukikaire's name has been added to the list, I now put the question.

(Question put and agreed to).

MR. KUTESA:  Mr. Speaker, I recall that on the Committee on Natural Resources you deleted the name of hon. Dombo.  I would like for ecstatic reasons to be put on that Committee in his place -(Laughter).

THE SPEAKER:  I did not get you.  Which Committee?

MR. KUTESA:  My name is hon. Sam Kutesa, I am not on any other Committee.

THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Sam Kutesa has requested to be included on the list of Members of the Committee on Natural Resources.  Any objection?  I now put the question.

(Question put and agreed to).
(-Mr. Lokawua rose-).

THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Member, we have still some business to do.  Unless your information is really -(Interruption).

MR. LOKAWUA: Mr. Speaker, my name does not appear on any list,  yet I had registered myself on Defence.

THE SPEAKER:  Any objections?  Apart from the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, I will close the adding of names to the Committees.  Let us consider the Legal Committee.  It is rather scantily populated.  I do not see why you are not interested in it hon. Members.  We only have 13 Members on the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs.  Can we have two more;  any volunteers to serve on that Committee?  It is a Committee which looks after Legal interest, you should be more concerned.

DR. LYOMOKI:  Mr. Speaker, I beg to nominate the name of hon. Bigirwa Bernadette for that Committee.

THE SPEAKER:  Nominate who?

DR. LYOMOKI:  Hon. Bigirwa Bernadette.

MRS. BIGIRWA:  I decline, Mr. Speaker.

THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Lyomoki, you should read our rule on this issue.  It is the person himself who has to indicate interest.  Any volunteers?  Yes, hon. Njuba.

MR. NJUBA:  Mr. Speaker in view of your comment, I would like to revert back to Legal,  from Defence.

THE SPEAKER:  So you have withdrawn your offer there and you want to move to Legal?  Is there any objection from the House?  No objection.  Hon. Njuba's name is deleted from the Committee on Defence and transferred to the Committee on Legal.  And now that makes it 14 Members on the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs.

MR. RWAKOOJO:   Mr. Speaker, I do not think my name is included on any of the lists.  I wanted to replace hon. Njuba on Defence.


THE SPEAKER:  Any objection?  I now put the question.

(Question put and agreed to).

THE SPEAKER:  Any other volunteer on Legal?  Can someone help us please so that we move a step further?  The minimum is 15 for that Committee.  

AN. HON. MEMBER:  Col. Kahinda Otafiire -(Laughter).

THE SPEAKER:  Is hon. Kahinda Otafiire around?  Is he around?  

HON. MEMBERS:  Aye, aye.

THE SPEAKER:  It cannot be aye,  whether he is around or not, unless you have seen him.

DR. NYEKO Pen'MOGI:  Mr. Speaker, I was hearing the name of hon. Dombo everywhere, so I presume he can fit anywhere. I propose hon. Dombo to fill up this place.

THE SPEAKER:  Any volunteer,  please? 

MR. DICK NYAI:  Mr. Speaker, this is a very serious matter.  There are hon. Colleagues here who refer to each other as 'my learned Colleague,'  and I am quite sure that among their numbers I can find 15 people.  Maybe you can ask one of them to call upon his Colleagues.  I propose that hon. Ben Wacha calls his Friends and they agree that they must constitute a Sessional Committee.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I think the Committee need not necessarily be composed of those of the learned profession.  We can blend it with other disciplines,  and enrich it that way.

MR. OLUM: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I think I will join the learned fellows on that Committee.  So, I propose that you move my name from Defence;  I go to Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee.

THE SPEAKER: Any objection?

HON. MEMBERS:  No objection.

THE SPEAKER: So, hon. Zachary Olum's name is deleted from the list of the Committee on Presidential Affairs and transferred to the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee.  I wish to thank hon. Zachary Olum for his courage and determination to go and enrich that Committee.  

Hon. Members, under rule 142,  sub rule 6, each Committee is to elect its own chairperson and deputy chairperson.  This now takes me to the problem raised by the hon. Babihuga.  Because of shortage of rooms, we shall try to share the little space available for the time being,  in order to dispatch business, particularly at the Committee level.  

The Committees on Agriculture and Trade will remain here in the Chamber to transact their business,  the Committee on Social Services will go to the eastern lobby,  the Committee on Transport will to the western lobby,  the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs will be in the Speaker's waiting room next to the western lobby - I think it is appropriate that they should be there.  That on Public Service,  in the Speaker's VIP room,  Natural Resources in the east committee room,  Presidential and Foreign Affairs in the east committee room,  Defence in the new library,  and Finance and Planning also in the library.

Hon. Members, I now adjourn the House,  to allow the Committees to dispatch business, to tomorrow 2.00 p.m. The House is adjourned.

(The House rose at 3.06 p.m,  and adjourned up to 16th June, 1999, at 2.00 p.m.)
