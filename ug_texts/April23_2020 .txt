COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you to this afternoon sitting. I will begin by apologising for the late start. We have been having meetings with the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development so that we can move without skirmishes on the Floor.

Secondly, honourable members, I would like to give the agreed guidelines on the issue of the COVID-19 funds. You will recall that Parliament, in the recently approved supplementary appropriation, allocated funds to the Parliamentary Commission in support of parliamentary activities to further the Government COVID-19 pandemic intervention programmes. 

To this end, the Commission, on the 17 April 2020, disbursed to each Member of Parliament funds to enable them participate in the furtherance of the aforesaid Government programmes.

Following a meeting held yesterday between His Excellency the President, the Speaker and the Prime Minister, we agreed on how best the activities of Parliament can be incorporated within those being implemented by the Government structures. The Parliamentary Commission has considered and reached the following guidelines: 

Henceforth, Members of Parliament are being incorporated into the respective district COVID-19 taskforces as members. The structure and leadership of the district taskforce shall remain as is. 

The honourable members of Parliament representing special interest groups in Parliament will be absorbed in the national taskforce, where the interventions are being coordinated. The National Workers’ Members of Parliament are already there. The National Female Youth Member of Parliament will join that taskforce. Hon. Safia Nalule, Female National Representative of Persons with Disabilities will also join the national taskforce.

A Member of Parliament will spend the funds advanced by the Commission for the COVID-19 pandemic only on those interventions meant to support the national response to the COVID-19 in their respective districts. 

We should appreciate, honourable members, that our districts are not homogenous. The needs of one district may not be the needs of another district. So, each district will determine how best to utilise the funds.

I would like to remind members that the Shs 20 million of MPs’ funds is not the only money available. There is also Shs 163 million that has been sent to the district for the same activity. No one has been talking about it but money has gone to the district for the COVID-19 campaign. The RDCs have been given Shs 55 million for the same activities. 

So, the members of the taskforce will agree on the best interventions depending on the priorities but it may include food, medical and emergency supplies or emergency relief. 

Accountabilities for the money shall be made to the accounting officer of Parliament with a copy to the chief administrative officer of the district where the district applies. The members belonging to the national taskforce will have no districts. I think their accountability will be to the Clerk and the head of the national taskforce. 

However, Members of Parliament shall adhere strictly to the Government of Uganda’s guidelines on COVID-19 pandemic and shall not personally get involved in the distribution of food or materials purchased with those funds. For avoidance, a member shall not organise meetings in his or her constituency in breach of the national guidelines especially on social distancing among others.

Each Member of Parliament shall use his or her official identity card issued by Parliament for purposes of traveling to join their respective COVID-19 taskforces, and participate in those activities as will be designed by their district taskforces. 

Honourable members, those are the guidelines for you to do your work.

Honourable members, again yesterday, there were members who wanted to raise issues but we are really so short of time. If we are here tomorrow or Tuesday, I will give an hour for members to raise matters of national importance. For now, we would like to go to the committee of supply. 

Thank you. 

Hon. Karungi, just clarification. 

MS KARUNGI: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I am seeking a clarification from you. It is very good that you explained that we shall not be allowed to hold any meetings or distribute anything to the community. 

However, in some districts, we are getting surprised that there are some people who wish to come to Parliament being given letters by the RDCs to distribute different kinds of materials. If I can give an example, in my district, one of my opponents - through good channels, we passed money here to ensure that we plant coffee in every area. We also passed money for fertilisers. 

In my district, one of my opponents together with Uganda Coffee Development Authority have been authorised to move around to distribute the fertilisers and to have meetings. All the leadership including the RDC are aware of that. She affirms to them that she was allowed to do that. It is not only in Kanungu. I am told it is happening in other districts as well. 

So, much as we are following the rules here, people who want to remove us from office are using this chance to go and meet with the voters privately in small and big meetings and the leaders in the districts are not cooperative. 

Thank you, Madam Speaker. 

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, the guidelines are not only for Members of Parliament. They are for all the people of Uganda. I think the guidelines were that you should not meet more than five people at ago. Whether you are an incumbent or an aspirant, you cannot go and distribute food anywhere. The RDCs who are doing that should be put to task by the Prime Minister. There is no exception to that rule.

MS ATYANG: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am seeking clarification especially on the issue of the funds that have been allocated for COVID-19 to the districts and the RDCs. This morning, I talked to the RDC who, at the time, was with the chief finance officer of my district. I asked him if the allocation for the district had reached them and the RDC told me that they have not yet received it. 

I am seeking clarification from the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development why certain districts have got the money and others have not. I do not know why my district has not got the money and yet other districts got. What could have happened? 

THE SPEAKER: Okay. The Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development will answer. 

3.07
MS HELLEN ASAMO (NRM, PWD Representative, Eastern): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I do not intend to go against what you have just said. However, as you are aware, as your Member of Parliament, I have 36 districts in my eastern region. Therefore, I am asking myself; which district will I be going to with that money? I need guidance on how we move as Members of Parliament, representing interest groups but who do not have specific areas. This is because, if I have to go to Busoga, others will complain and the reverse is true if I go to the other side. Therefore, can I be guided on which district I will focus on? Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: You will go to the district called “Uganda” at the national taskforce.

MS ASAMO: Thank you, Madam Speaker.

3.08
MR MOHAMMAD NSEREKO (Independent, Kampala Division Central, Kampala): Thank you, Madam Speaker. Of course I would like to thank you for having stood your ground on this matter and Members of Parliament for having brought the cause for the world to realise that as an arm of Government, we also need to participate in the fight against COVID-19.

Madam Speaker, there are endless calls - like you have said to us. While we accept that Government is in distress with endless calls but also Members of Parliament are getting endless calls. I will give you an example that for me, in Kampala while holding my Facebook live on Saturday, I got 65,000 people sending me messages to ask for food.

Now, I am between a rock and a hard place. The Shs 20 million that we have gotten, if you look at Kampala and its structure, unless we take it according to guidelines you have read and just re-donate it back to the national taskforce, it is only a drop in the ocean. 

You talked about the matter of accountability; the only way I feel comfortable is to give my people that have no food the food. However, I cannot carry it in form of food.

Otherwise, does your directive stop me from sending electronic money to people and account for it through the mobile money platform?

THE SPEAKER: No problem. You can send and bring the accountability to the Clerk - that “I sent money to 100,000 people.”

MR NSEREKO: Thank you, Madam Speaker. We can use from you, the mobile money platform and electronic transfer to feed our people. Thank you very much.

MOTION THAT THE HOUSE RESOLVES ITSELF INTO A COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY FOR CONSIDERATION AND APPROVAL OF:

    A. THE REVISED EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018/2019

    B. THE BUDGETARY PROPOSAL FOR ESTIMATES OF REVENUE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020/2021.

3.11
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Matia Kasaija): Madam Speaker, I beg to move -

THE SPEAKER: Honourable minister, sorry. There is a matter we asked the Attorney-General to handle yesterday. He wants to give us his brief and then we can proceed. Let us have the Attorney-General first; I had not seen him arrive.

3.12
THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr William Byaruhanga): Thank you, Madam Speaker. Yesterday, you made a ruling that I should come and explain the order that was delivered by the court on 21 April 2020.

Madam speaker, this is my explanation:
 
On the 8 April 2020, this Parliament approved a supplementary budget and this budget included a payment of Shs 10 billion to the members of this House. This was done pursuant to an amendment of supplementary expenditure, Schedule No.2, Addendum 1 and 2 for the Financial Year 2019/2020.

Madam Speaker, on the 20 April 2020, a member of this House, hon. Gerald Karuhanga of Ntungamo Municipality, filed a suit in the High Court of Uganda against both the Parliamentary Commission and the Attorney-General. In this suit, which was registered as miscellaneous application No.179/2020, hon. Karuhanga contends the amendment of the report of the budget committee on the supplementary expenditure Schedule No.2, Addendum 1 and 2 for the Financial Year 2019/2020, by the chairperson of that committee, to include Shs 10 billion for the Parliamentary Commission on the Floor of Parliament. He alleged that it was irrational, questionable, arbitrary and unfair. He, therefore, requested the court to declare that these amendments were illegal, null and void. He also asked court to issue an order quashing these amendments.

Madam Speaker, on the 21 April 2020, the High Court issued an interim order against the Parliamentary Commission and the Attorney-General in these terms - you actually said them yesterday.

    1.  Miscellaneous application No.179/2020, be and is hereby set down for hearing on the 29 April 2020 at 10.00 a.m.

    2. It also held that until the hearing and determination of the miscellaneous application No.179/2020, the status quo, which was pursuant to paragraphs 16,17,18 and 19 of hon. Karuhanga’s affidavit, which was sworn in support of his application be maintained.

Meaning that the monies in the sum of Shs 10 billion which were appropriated to the first respondent, the Parliamentary Commission under the impinged amendment to the report of the budget committee in supplementary expenditure schedule No.2, addendum 1 and 2 for the Financial Year 2019/2020 should remain undistributed until the determination of the miscellaneous application No.179/2020, or that if it had been paid, the Members of Parliament were ordered not to spend the same until the hearing and determination of the miscellaneous application No.179/2020, or until further orders of that court.

Now, Madam Speaker, my quick interpretation of this High Court order is that; first of all, it is too prompt. The first order of the court is the Parliamentary Commission in the event that it had not yet distributed the sum of Shs 10 billion, they should remain undistributed until the determination of the miscellaneous application No.179/2020.

That particular application is one for a temporary injunction and this was an interim order. 

Secondly, was that in the alternative, if the Shs 10 billion had already been paid out by the Parliamentary Commission to the Members of Parliament, they (the Members of Parliament), were ordered not to dispend or spend the same until the determination of the miscellaneous application No.179/2020 that I have already spoken about, which has been fixed for hearing on the 29 April 2020 or until further orders of this court.

Therefore, Madam Speaker, it is important that the status quo of the payment of this Shs 10 billion as at the 21 day of April 2020, as determined by the High Court - it is, therefore, imperative that this status quo is clarified by the Parliamentary Service Commission. What is in issue here is whether the Parliamentary Commission was aware of the order before the payment was made or not? Similarly, whether any honourable member, who has already spent the money, was aware of the order at the time of the expenditure?

Madam Speaker - 

THE SPEAKER: Order, honourable members.  

MR WILLIAM BYARUHANGA: Madam Speaker, from the facts available to me - and the Clerk to Parliament presented to me evidence of payment - I have found that the Parliamentary Commission paid out these monies on 17 April 2020, before the court order was issued; it was issued on 21 April 2020. That being the case, that court order appears to have been overtaken by events in that particular respect. 

However, needless to add is the fact that the court decision itself is binding on the parties to the suit and Members of Parliament, until it is reversed or until the court gives further guidance. 

In accordance with Article 128 (3) of our Constitution, it is incumbent upon both the Government and the Parliamentary Commission to ensure that a court order is respected. That is in addition to the fact that any action to the contrary by a person, to whom that court order applies, would expose that person to contempt of court. 

The question is one of fact. The question that has to be interrogated is for those Members of Parliament – and that would of course include the Parliamentary Commission – if as has been shown to me by the Clerk, the money was sent on 17 April 2020 and then up to until the date of the order, which was 21 April 2020; that particular segment has been obviously been overtaken by events. 

The question shall be about monies, which are on the accounts of Members of Parliament after 21 April, after the court order had been made known to this honourable House. 

Madam Speaker, needless to tell you, there is a general duty to obey the court orders. The general principle regarding this is that the party who knows of the order, whether it is null or valid, regular or irregular, cannot be permitted to disobey it once they know of it. That principle is founded in Common Law and has been reiterated many times by our Ugandan courts. 

It was also established in the Supreme Court, in which they rejected the argument that a court order should not be obeyed if it has errors. The Supreme Court, in the case of Arim Flexis v. Stanbic Bank of 2015, held it that way. 

Therefore, as I conclude, the issue is that all persons who know of a court order affecting them, whether they think it is null or valid, regular or irregular, have a duty to obey it. And failure to obey that court order, of course, exposes them to contempt of court proceedings and that is punishable by a fine and imprisonment, depending on the court. 

The honourable members of Parliament who spent the money after the 21 April 2020, the date on which that court order was issued, would, from what I have said, be held to be in contempt. 

Permit me then to point out, Madam Speaker, that, of course, the Parliamentary Commission and any honourable member, who feels aggrieved by this order, is open to challenge it before that court and have it discharged. I think that is what is expected to be done on 29 April 2020. 

My office, of course, shall interact with the Parliamentary Commission on the instructions that we shall be given on this matter. However, as I have said, spending of the money after 21 April 2020 would tantamount to contempt of court.

Finally, to state the obvious, the cooperation and compliance by both the Government and the Parliament is always taken as a given in view of the cardinal doctrine of separation of powers between the three arms of the state. I thank you, Madam Speaker, and I hope I have clarified on this issue.  

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much, Attorney-General but I beg to differ with you. The status quo upon which the court ruled was that money had already been sent out. That is the status quo, which it maintained. There was no money in the Commission at that time because it had been paid out at the time the suit was filed. The suit was filed on 21 April 2020 yet the money had been paid on 17 April 2020; I want you to understand that. 

Therefore, the status quo that the court eventually talked about is that the money had already gone. For you to say that a court can gun-shield the accounts of members who are not party to a suit is something that we should really avoid. The Members of Parliament were not party to this suit and the court had no business to interfere with their accounts. Attorney-General, no way. 

MR WILLIAM BYARUHANGA: Madam Speaker, I thank you - 

THE SPEAKER: Next time, the court will say, “Take off your clothes when you are in the House” and we shall have to obey?

MR WILLIAM BYARUHANGA: I hope that they would not do that. Madam Speaker, clearly, that would be the first – as I have already said, the court sits as long as it is factual. What you have just stated that on the day of hearing, the money had been dispatched - 

THE SPEAKER: Even the day of filing and hearing, the money had already gone. 

MR WILLIAM BYARUHANGA: Yes, even the day of filing but, Madam Speaker, of course - 

THE SPEAKER: Do not encourage the courts to overrun Parliament. No!

MR WILLIAM BYARUHANGA: Madam Speaker, the issue is that, that would be the first ground by which, on the 29 April 2020, that matter would be expected to be thrown out. However, the court is entitled to make the order -– (Interruption)

MR KATUSABE: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I have heard and listened in to the very wise legal submission by the Attorney-General. However, as a scholar, a philosopher and thinker, the Attorney-General’s submission borders on the scandalisation of Parliament.  

Madam Speaker, as a peer and one of the best lawyers that we have in the country, you made a legal and extremely wise interpretation and a ruling. 

Is the Attorney-General, a learned fellow and somebody that has the constitutional mandate to guide and advise Government and the three arms of Government, in order to proceed to scandalise the institution of Parliament, to the extent that he is opening this Parliament literally to be impended with a mockery from an institution of Government that is supposed to reinforce Government and work together? 

Madam Speaker, I am asking for your ruling and guidance if the learned Attorney-General is in order to continue with a submission that borders nothing but scandalising this great institution, and making a mockery of our mandate and our constitutional duty in this country? Thank you, Madam Speaker.

3.26
MR ABBAS AGABA (NRM, Kitagwenda County, Kamwenge): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I have also listened to the Attorney-General’s interpretation of the interim order. I think we need to agree; it is a principle of law that we don’t legislate in anticipation. 

Therefore, the fact that the order was issued with two prongs:

    1. Address to the Parliamentary Commission that in the event that they have not released the money, they should not.

    2.  In anticipation that if the money has been released then the Members of Parliament would not use it. That in itself is challenging legally because:

    (i) The Members of Parliament were not directly party to the suit so we were surprised that in the order, the learned judge dragged the Members of Parliament into the suit and instructed them not to touch the money. I think this was irregular.

    (ii) Madam Speaker, our accounts are person-to-holder and they are transactional accounts. I don’t know how the judge separates the money I have on my account - that this is money for COVID-19 and this is money for Abbas when it is on my account. 

I would like to agree with you, Madam Speaker, that it would be fair that the learned Attorney-General also sees the loopholes in the judgement that it could be basis for them to contest it again in the courts of law. However, to explain to the House that we are bound by this judgement, especially when we were not directly party to the suit, is in itself very difficult to appreciate. Thank you.     

THE SPEAKER: Also, honourable members, by interfering with the Shs 10 billion, the judge is actually interfering with the whole supplementary; the Shs 304 billion. Therefore, even those are injuncted - Yes, because they are one Bill. 

3.29
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SPORTS (SPORTS) (Mr Denis Obua): Madam Speaker, the learned Attorney-General, in his interpretation, stated that the decision, in his opinion, is binding to the parties and to the Members of Parliament.

One of the parties is the Parliamentary Commission. May I seek to find out from the learned Attorney-General whether the Parliamentary Commission was dragged to court in its corporate capacity or representative capacity? 

Secondly, I am a Member of Parliament and by the interpretation of the Attorney-General, this decision is binding on me. I have not been heard, I have not been served with the order and I am not a party to the suit in court. How does this bind me as a Member of Parliament? Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: I looked at the papers and the part of the order saying members’ accounts should not be touched was not one of the prayers. The judge got excited and said now, even the accounts.  

3.31
MR JAMES KAKOOZA (Independent, Kabula County, Lyantonde):  Madam Speaker, there are three Arms of Government and they work independently. If Parliament is doing its work, can another Arm of Government tell Parliament, don’t do your job? Can Members of Parliament intervene in the work of Judiciary?

Moreover, the appropriation was a total and not only Parliamentary Commission. It was the Judiciary, Ministry of Health, President’s Office – We appropriated a total amount when we supplied. We did not supply only one item; we supplied the total. 

Why is the accuser talking of only Parliamentary Commission and not the other amount of money that was supplied? We would like to seek clarification from the Attorney-General. A supplementary is brought by Government; it is not through a private member’s Bill. A supplementary came from Government and I would like to know whether Parliament cannot do its work to amend it; to add or to subtract. That is the clarification I would like to seek from the Attorney-General. 

3.33
MR JOHN BAPTIST LOKII (NRM, Matheniko County, Moroto): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to comment on the statement by the learned Attorney-General in regard to the interim injunction for the Members of Parliament to spend the Shs 20 million that was given to them to go and join the rest of Ugandans to mobilise communities to fight the coronavirus disease. 

Madam Speaker, I am shocked by the statement of the Attorney-General. This is a direct attack on Parliament; they have attacked the work of Parliament and the Attorney-General is not telling us clearly why he is taking that position. Parliament, in its mandate, followed the right procedures to appropriate that money to various expenditure entities. I expected the Attorney-General to tell us that maybe we flouted certain procedures and that is the reason they are denying Members of Parliament to spend that money. This is an attack on Parliament and it is unacceptable.

Secondly, this appropriation was done to different entities. You cannot pick Parliament and say, they should not spend while you leave other entities to spend the money. We have allocated money to the media, we have allocated money to the districts, we have allocated money to security, we have allocated money to the Ministry of Health and we have allocated money even to the Judiciary. Why are they picking on Parliament? 

If that is the case, we have to take all this money back to the Government coffers and go back to the drawing board. Why single out Parliament? What interests do you have? You want to stop us from using the law to appropriate money, you want to stop Parliament from joining the rest of the country in fighting COVID-19 so that tomorrow - Because we missed out in the districts, they will say, “These Members of Parliament are insensitive. Even when there is danger, an enemy within the country, they cannot come to help the rest of the country to fight the enemy.” Is that what you want to show the whole world; that the Parliament of Uganda does not want to fight the enemy? 

Madam Speaker, I beg to submit.     

MR ISAAC MUSUMBA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am disturbed and I require guidance from you. As Parliament, the rules say a motion can be brought to the House for appropriation and we refer it to the committee and the committee comes and makes a report. On the other hand, the rules say we can listen to a minority report – an opportunity is given to a member to present a minority report, the House listens to the minority report and the main report and the House votes against the minority report. 

The question on which I seek clarification is: can we justify, within our rules, a situation where a member, whose motion is defeated in the House, can now go to the court to have his or her motion heard and determined? We discussed and voted against the minority report here. We voted in favour of the main report. The very member who presented and lost over the minority report went to court and he is not raising a procedural issue – like quorum or things like that – but he is raising the substance of his minority report. 

I seek to be guided on whether the Rules of Procedure of Parliament permit it. If so, is it now open for everybody who loses a presentation that he makes in the House to go to court and have it overruled? Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, within our rules, there are avenues for redress or for complaint. We have a channel for objecting. If you lose and you think you have lost – 40 of you stand up to reject the decision. They did not do that. They lost and went out to court. I think we need to find a way of dealing with these members. (Applause) You cannot solve parliamentary issues in the court. 
	
Now, honourable members, this is the Attorney-General – you know we have been complaining about the role of the Attorney-General in defending Parliament. Sometimes we do not know which side you are on – sometimes you have abandoned us there, in the courts. You have consented with the other side, leaving us. (Applause) Yes. We look at this as an attempt to suffocate the work of Parliament – to diminish the powers of Parliament. (Applause)

Secondly, I would like to warn the banks, which are interfering with members’ accounts: you will be sued. You, the banks, will be sued. The members you are disturbing have no judgement against them. None! Which bank can produce a judgement against hon. Nankabirwa? No one! So, all is just stupidity. (Laughter) 

Anyway, let us have the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development.	

3.40
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Matia Kasaija): Madam Speaker, I would like to move that the House resolves itself into the Committee of Supply for the consideration and approval of:

1. The revised expenditure estimates for Fiscal Year 2018/2019
2. The budgetary proposal for the estimates of revenue and expenditure for Financial Year 2020/2021.

 I beg to move.

THE SPEAKER: Is the motion seconded? Yes, it has been seconded.

MR KATUSABE: Madam Speaker, during yesterday’s sitting you gave members the opportunity to make their passionate submissions on this particular budget. There were a lot of items raised, relating to the concerns of communities that they represent: water, electric wire, stimulus package, research and many other things. We also received a minority report. 

My procedural issue is, wouldn’t it be procedurally right that, before we translate into an appropriation committee, the minister first responds specifically to the issues that originated from the members yesterday? The communities we represent in this House must be listening and they want a response.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable member, you are interfering with my work. We agreed with the minister that before we start the supply, he will speak. The motion was seconded. You make your statement and we move.

MR KASAIJA: Madam Speaker, let me begin by thanking the Committee on Budget for the time they have dedicated to discuss the Budget for Financial Year 2020/2021 during this difficult time of COVID-19. 

As we are all aware, I made a statement on the Floor of this House on the impact of COVID-19 on our economy during which I elaborated the Government’s economic policy responses in dealing with the impact of this pandemic. With Uganda recording its first case of COVID-19 on 21 March, 2020 and now having recorded 63 cases, the negative impact on the economy – and largely on the private sector – may worsen even further in a few months to come.

A number of sectors have already been affected, like the tourism industry which is one of the major sources of our foreign exchange earnings. Foreign exchange earnings from the tourism sector have significantly reduced on account of declining demand and travel restrictions. 

Manufacturing and trade sectors, which rely heavily on supplies especially from China, India and Europe have also registered a significant decline in production and sales. However, as an emergency, Parliament passed supplementary funding of Shs 304 billion, in addition to the Shs 25 billion that had been provided earlier from the Contingency Fund. This was allocated across the relevant sectors to curb the immediate –

THE SPEAKER: Honourable minister, I do not know whether you are responding to the debate or doing something else? You are supposed to respond to yesterday’s debate.

MR KASAIJA: I am coming to that, Madam Speaker. This is a preamble.

THE SPEAKER: Okay.

MR KASAIJA: I have actually completed the preamble. Now, I want to respond to the specific issues raised by Members yesterday.

Health Sector 

The honourable members raised a number of issues under the health sector.

i. 	Upgrading of the health centres II to health centres III

I would like to use this opportunity to talk about Government’s policy on health centres II and III. According to the policy of the Government of the National Resistance Movement (NRM), every sub-county is supposed to have a health centre III. We are moving very well in that direction - (Interjection) -– At an appropriate time, I will ask my colleague, the Minister of Health, to come and lay on the information on the Table. I am the one giving the money, so I know what we are doing down there.

ii. 	The functionality of health centres III.
iii. 	The operationalization of Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in referral hospitals.

Madam Speaker, I wish to respond as follows:

1. 	Government has provided Shs 3.5 billion in the budget for financial year 2020/2021 for the operationalisation and salaries of newly upgraded health centres III.

2. 	We are negotiating funding of $250 million from the World Bank for upgrading health centres III for districts, which still have gaps.

3. 	Additional funding of Shs 50 billion from the Uganda Reproductive Maternal and Child Health Improvement Service Project has been provided for equipping health centres III and upgrading health centres II. 

4. 	Under the supplementary funding for COVID-19, funds have been provided for in intensive care units for regional referral hospitals to enhance their capacity to respond to the pandemic.

Education Sector 

Madam Speaker, under the education sector, the following issues were raised:

i. 	The functionality of seed secondary schools.
ii. 	Recruitment of staff. 
iii. 	Salary enhancements. 

Madam Speaker and colleagues, I wish to respond as follows:

1. 	Shs 50 billion has been provided for the enhancement of salaries of teaching staff in public universities. As guided by His Excellency the President, a professor will get the promised Shs 15 million per month. I was expecting to hear a clap.

2. 	Shs 20 billion for recruitment has been provided to the public universities.

3. 	Shs 10 billion has been provided to enhance salaries of scientists under the National Agricultural Advisory Services (NARO).

4. 	For the seed secondary schools, Government has provided Shs 24 billion for equipping science laboratories and libraries across local governments in the budget for the coming financial year.

5. 	Government has also provided Shs 17.1 billion for staffing in seed secondary schools under the Uganda Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer (UgIFT) project.

Agriculture

Madam Speaker, under the agriculture sector, Members raised a concern on the share of the sector in the overall budget. I respond as follows:

1. 	Government has increased the budget of the agriculture sector to Shs 1,304.8 trillion representing 3.7 per cent of the total resource envelop for financial year 2020/2021. This is up from Shs 1,563 trillion, which was 3.2 per cent of the total resource envelop for budget for financial year 2019/2020 in nominal terms. However, it should be noted that there are other interventions implemented by other sectors supporting the agricultural sector such as rural roads, microfinance, rural electrification, irrigation among others.

2. 	Shs 40 billion has been provided for the local government as part of funding from World Bank under the UgIFT project. However, the committee has proposed reallocation of these funds to other areas. We have discussed this with the committee this afternoon. I am sure the chairman of the committee with tell us how this is going to be handled.

Local Government Sector 

Madam Speaker, the honourable members raised the following issues under the local government sector:

i)i. 	Facilitation of the local councils. 
ii.ii) 	Bicycles and motorcycles for the local councils. 
 
In this regard, my response is as follows: Shs 21.4 billion is in the budget to cater for bicycles and Shs 20 billion for motorcycles to facilitate the local councils.

Other Issues Raised by the Committee

Madam Speaker, Members raised other issues which include the following:

i. 	Salary enhancement for scientists.
ii. 	Financing for Emyooga. 
iii. 	Funding for Uganda Development Bank.
iv. 	Mismanagement of the disaster response and displacement impact project under the office of the Prime Minister.
v. 	Compensation for war debts. 

Madam Speaker, I would like to respond as follows:

1. 	On the issue of enhancement of salaries for scientists, I wish to remind the House that in July 2019, Shs 100 billion was provided by cutting transport equipment across Government. We will continue to enhance salaries for all public officers including scientists when external shocks like COVID-19 and locusts have been addressed.

2. 	In the budget for the next financial year, we have provided Shs 100 billion for Emyooga to fund specialised groups.

3.  Shs 103 billion, has been provided for the capitalisation of Uganda Development bank. Furthermore, Government is negotiating with development partners to fully capitalise Uganda Development Bank.

Finally, honourable members raised the issue of mismanagement of the Development Response to the Displacement Impact Project. (DRDIP) under the Office of the Prime Minister, to which I am expected to make report.

Madam Speaker, I wish to respond that the project is being implemented by the Office of the Prime Minister. However, my ministry guided sectors that funds for activities implemented in local governments should be appropriated under the respective local governments. This has not been heeded to by many Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). I request Parliament to ensure that in the financial year 2021/2022, all funds for activities in local governments will be appropriated directly under their respective votes.

War Debts

Regarding the compensation of war claimants in northern and eastern Uganda, Shs 15 billion has been provided in the budget for war debts. However, the committee, in its wisdom, proposed reallocation of these funds for another activity. I propose that these funds remain for war debts as initially planned and budgeted for.

Finally, due to the uncertainty of the immediate future, this budget may be subjected to reviews and amendments. In that case, I will come back to Parliament to discuss this matter sooner than later. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you, Minister. Let us go to the Committee of Supply.

MOTION FOR THE HOUSE TO RESUME

5.54
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Matia Kasaija): Madam Chairperson, I beg to move that the House do resume and the Committee of Supply reports thereto. 

THE CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, I put the question that the House do resume and the Committee of Supply do report thereto.

	(	Question put and agreed to.)

(The House resumed, the Speaker presiding.)

REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY

5.55
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Matia Kasaija): Madam Speaker, I beg to report that the Committee of Supply has considered the Budget for the Financial Year 2020/2021 and supplied without amendments for recurrent expenditure allocations.  

MOTION FOR ADOPTION OF THE REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY

5.55
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Matia Kasaija): Madam Speaker, I move a motion for the adoption of the report from the Committee of Supply. 

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, the question is that the report of the Committee of Supply be adopted. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

Report adopted.

5.56
THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Ms Betty Aol): Thank you, Madam Speaker. The members of the Opposition had a concern and you told them to note it but I would also like to know where we create Missions because I have seen that Mombasa houses our Mission. Probably, it was done in the House when some of us were not there. We have Nairobi but Mombasa is new to me. 

Whenever members of the Opposition want to express something – at least, you know that we are always in the House and we have to listen to each other. 

THE SPEAKER: When I read Mombasa, I thought it was a consulate but then I was told it is a mission; so, I said that I will go with what I was told. Where is the Minister of Foreign Affairs? Do we have two missions or a consulate? It cannot be a mission because the mission is in Nairobi. Where is the Minister of Foreign Affairs? 

Honourable members, I think we shall get the right information -– 

5.58
MR ATKINS KATUSABE (FDC, Bukonjo County West, Kasese): Madam Speaker, as you are aware, the country’s top diplomat serves as a Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs but also the minister for foreign affairs in the peoples’ government. 

In regard to Mombasa, we still count it and it still serves the nation and the region as a consulate. Madam Speaker, the practice has been that it has a standalone budget but we marry them with the Mombasa-Uganda property holding - 

THE SPEAKER: I hope you are not submitting on other things. Is it a consulate or an embassy? You have said it is a consulate but tomorrow we shall confirm - 

MR KATUSABE: To answer that, it is a consulate with standalone branches. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 

THE SPEAKER: Okay, honourable members, the House is adjourned to 10 o’clock tomorrow to complete the remaining processes. Thank you very much. 

(The House rose at 6.00 p.m. and adjourned until Friday, 24 April 2020 at 10.00 a.m.)
