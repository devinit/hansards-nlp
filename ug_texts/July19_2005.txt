PRAYERS

(The Speaker, Mr Edward Ssekandi, in the Chair.)

The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you and I hope that you had a peaceful and fruitful weekend. I hope that you have mobilised people about the coming political event in the country. Thank you very much.

MR AGGREY AWORI: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was just wondering if the satellite dish was destroyed beyond repair. Reading the weather forecast –(Laughter)

THE SPEAKER:  Yes, you must have looked at the sky and seen that it is changing; it is most likely to rain today –(Laughter)- but I have a problem. I do not know whether people are still considering this to be a Monday because we did not sit yesterday! The number is small yet as you remember last time we were not able to pronounce ourselves on the report simply because we lacked the requisite number. I, therefore, have to suspend the proceedings because what use is it for me to put a question when you cannot make a decision? I do not know what you can advise, honourable minister.

THE MINISTER OF STATE, PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS (Mrs Hope Mwesigye): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Maybe we could suspend up to 11.00 a.m. I will endeavour to have as many members present by that time –(Interruption)

THE SPEAKER:  11.00 a.m.! It is about time.

MRS MWESIGYE:  Okay, 11.30 a.m. 

THE SPEAKER: Okay, let us suspend to 11.30 a.m. 

(The House was suspended at 10.37 a.m.)

(On resumption at 11.32 a.m._)

11.33
MR HENRY KITYO (Mawokota County South, Mpigi): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am rising on a point of national importance on the prices of sugar. As you may recall, the current national budget, which we are about to debate increased the prices of sugar by only Shs 50 per kilo; and also VAT went up from 17 to 18 percent a kilo. That is an addition of only 1 percent.  

Sugar is a political commodity. You remember during the last days of Idi Amin, sugar was very scarce and we used to buy it on the black market. If you were found with one kilo of sugar, it could cost your life. During the UNLF time, sugar was listed as one of the major essential commodities and we made endless lines to get it. 

Thanks to the NRM Government that sugar which is an essential commodity particularly to the kids, pregnant mothers, the elderly and the sick, is available although its current price of Shs 2,000 per kilo has proved to be prohibitive. Sometime back I visited Kinyara Sugar Works and had a meeting with the General Manager. He told me that they have not increased the prices of sugar for the last one year. The factory price is still Shs 1,050 per kilo and the new VAT is Shs 185 per kilo. Sugar tax is Shs 50; plus other taxes it comes to –(Interruption) 

DR KIBIRIGE SEBUNYA: Mr Speaker, may I thank hon. Kityo for giving way. He started off by saying that we are just about to discuss the Budget. It will seem to me that it would be more prudent for us to handle this matter when we come to the Budget discussions. I am not so sure whether he can get any satisfactory answer at this stage. Thank you.  

THE SPEAKER: Well, I allowed him to make the statement. People will not stop taking tea because we have not discussed the Budget.  

MR KITYO: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker for that very wise ruling. As I was tabulating the prices, after adding all these costs, sugar should cost Shs 1,200 to the retailer. Who is taking the Shs 800 to make it Shs 2,000? My prayer to this House is to ask the hon. Minister of Tourism, Trade and Industry to give this House a report on the prices of sugar within seven days. Who is cheating who? The Government of Uganda cannot sit back and let people be cheated under the cover of privatisation and liberalisation. We should remember that sugar impacts on politics. 

THE SPEAKER: Okay. Thank you very much. Hon. Minister of Trade.

11.36
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM, WILDLIFE & ANTIQUITIES (Mr Jovino Ayumu Akaki): Mr Speaker, I thank the honourable member for raising this issue. As we are all aware, pricing is a function of the Ministry of Tourism, Trade and Industry but also a function of the Ministry of Finance. I request that we are given time to consult and come and give a statement. I thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Okay, thank you very much. Honourable members in my communication I forgot to tell you that I have seen a lot of things being written in newspapers about you as Parliament and this is in respect of the subsistence allowance, which you get. I think those who are writing it must have been given the wrong information by some people but an appropriate statement, a comprehensive one, will be made on this matter. 

However, I want to advise those who have been writing about this issue of subsistence allowances in which you are accused of being “Shylocks,” that they should further consult those who gave them the information about the existence of Circular Standing Instructions No. 2 of 2005 on the revised rates of duty facilitating allowances. The reference of this circular is PMD80/80/01, dated 15 February 2005. If they read it they would have a balanced reporting on the issue. I can read for the record: 

“The service is hereby informed that the rates of duty facilitating allowances have been revised and take effect from 1st July 2005. The revised rates shall be accommodated within the ministry, departments of local government budgets and implemented within the existing regulations.  

Accounting officers are required to bring the contents of this Circular to the attention of all public officers for information and implementation. 

Signed, Jimmy Lwamafa.
Permanent Secretary.” 

Distribution “A” concerns night allowances within Uganda for political leaders and they give the rates, which range to Shs 140,000 per night. You have been getting Shs 100,000 before, far less than this figure. This circular is here but nobody has bothered to comment about it; they are only hanging you. I sympathise with you -(Applause)- but you will receive a comprehensive statement. It is regrettable that this information was passed to those people but in any case we have not even considered the Budget; we are working on the Constitution Amendment Bills. So, for somebody to jump and hang you when there is an official document, which we can refer to, is really lamentable. Thank you very much. (Applause)
 
11.42
MS BEATRICE KIRASO (Woman Representative, Kabarole): Mr Speaker, thank you very much for that communication. I would like also to urge some government officials to desist from making statements, which are inconsequential, uncalled for and irresponsible. I am referring to the statement made by the Minister of State, Information, hon. Nsaba Buturo, to the press informing them that we Members of Parliament are going to be given money facilitation to campaign for the referendum.  

Mr Speaker, there have been a lot of reactions and that statement has also attracted a lot of criticism from the public because we are very much aware that money for civic education was given to the Electoral Commission. I do not know whether a statement like that is made to appease us as Members of Parliament, or black mail us! Some members of the Executive should be careful with the kind of statements they make in reference to Members of Parliament and their facilitation. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Yes, for instance in this circular a permanent secretary’s allowance per a night is Shs 110,000 and a Member of Parliament’s is Shs 100,000. Can you imagine!

BILLS 
COMMITTEE STAGE

THE CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT NO. 3) BILL, 2005

11.45
THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, you remember when we adjourned the House there was a motion for us to adopt the report after the House had resumed, but apparently we have not pronounced ourselves on this because of certain technicalities. I realise that there was a slight error, since we have not, at an appropriate time, a proper report will be given on the Clause, which we stopped. We had done more than what was mentioned in that report but since the report was not adopted, I think we shall consider it with the report after we have finished the work of today. So, can you go to the next Clause?

THE CHAIRMAN: The report then was that we had stopped at 78. No, we had gone up to 80.

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, Clause 81 –(Interruption) 

THE CHAIRMAN: I think we had dealt with 81.

MR OULANYAH: We had dealt with 81.

Clause 81

MR MWESIGE: Mr Chairman, we raised our hands but we did not have quorum to enable us continue.

THE CHAIRMAN: What was the position on 81, was it to be deleted? Honourable members, the motion was to delete Clause 81. So, can we vote on this amendment since the minister agreed with the motion? 

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the vote on the motion to delete Clause 81 is as follows: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 103. The motion is carried. (Applause).  

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 81 deleted.

Clause 82

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, Clause 82 proposes to amend Article 231 on the reporting system by the Inspectorate of Government. The new Clause proposes to introduce a new reporting system by the President to Parliament on investigations carried out by the Inspectorate of Government. The Constitution as it is makes the Inspectorate of Government responsible directly to Parliament. Creating a double reporting structure is a bit confusing. We propose the deletion of Clause 82.

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, the Government does not agree that Clause 82 should be deleted. We want to ensure that the President informs Parliament of actions taken on the reports of the IGG and we want to ensure that these reports from the IGG are discussed by Parliament. For these two reasons we oppose the deletion of this clause. (Applause)

CAPT. BYARUHANGA: Mr Chairman, I want to get clarification from the committee. You see, there are some special investigations carried out by the IGG and he reports directly to the President. As Parliament we are not informed of any action taken. If you delete this, how are we going to know as Parliament the action taken on special reports of investigations?

THE CHAIRMAN: So the position is not on the annual report which the IGG submits, but on special commissions’ reports on one item or the other. Is that the position?

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, the Inspectorate of Government does investigations at the instigation of various institutions, including the Presidency. What this Article is proposing is that the President should report on investigations that are initiated by him, the action on investigations initiated by him and the Inspectorate of Government as he files the report. There are other investigations that are requested by other departments. 
There is no obligation on those departments to report to Parliament what actions they have taken in respect of those findings. Unless we are suggesting that the President will oversee all investigations and report on all local governments and other institutions that are carried out by the Inspectorate, because there is no obligation for the Inspectorate of Government to report to the President on some of those investigations. So, which investigations is the President being mandated to report on to Parliament? And if it is about investigations that are reported to him, what about investigations from other departments, who will be obliged to report on them to Parliament, is it the President also?

MS KIRASO: Mr Chairman, this argument that you have just given proposes to delete because there is no mechanism of reporting to Parliament on other investigations. Instead of deleting and even removing government’s wish to report to Parliament the actions taken by the President, why don’t you as a committee propose an amendment to capture the other reports that are not made to the President?  Is deletion a solution?

MR LWANGA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I am really surprised that the chairman of the committee has not probably read this carefully and he is somebody I really respect and love as a very good friend of mine. What this thing is saying –(Interruption)

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, is really the honourable minister insinuating that I cannot read?

THE CHAIRMAN: No, you can read definitely. I think you are talking about interpretation, which is different.

MR LWANGA: I withdraw that if it is annoying but what I was trying to say is that he read it as a lawyer. Let us read it as ordinary people. It says “The President shall, at least once every year, cause a report to be submitted to Parliament on actions taken by the President on reports - and these are many reports - submitted to the President by the Inspectorate of Government for the information of Parliament.” What it means is, the IGG may make many reports and Parliament never gets to know what actions have been taken and what this Clause is doing, is making the President accountable to Parliament. It is to say, “Look the IGG reported this and this is the action that has been taken.” I beg that we support the Clause as it is. Thank you.

THE CHAIRMAN: Mr Chairman, any reaction?

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, I think you should put the matter to vote.

MR WANDERA: Before we put this matter to vote I request members to seriously consider what the chairman of the committee is saying. Under Article 231(1), the IGG is under obligation to submit a report to Parliament once every six months.

The committee is saying. Under Article 231(1) the IGG is under obligation to submit a report once every six months, to Parliament. There is no Clause under this Article that makes it an obligation of the IGG to report to the President. What I see is that members seem to be assuming that the reports to the President under the proposed Article 231(4) are those made under Article 231(1). The Attorney-General is saying that the President on his own may require the IGG to make investigations and it is on the basis of those investigations that he will report to Parliament.

The other thing would be to create a new Clause that says the IGG would report to the President - but that would be a double reporting mechanism. I think under Article 231(1), upon receiving a copy –(Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable member, the report is submitted every six months to Parliament and under (2), the copies are sent to the President and they may involve this and the other. I think this particular provision in the Bill is for the President to react and say, “Well, on my part I have done this and that”. That is what they meant.

MR WANDERA: Mr Chairman, you know I am a gentleman; I concede.   

THE CHAIRMAN: Let me put the question. Honourable members, there is a motion by the committee that we delete the proposed Clause 82 in respect of reports and so forth, the one of the committee.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position is: there is one abstention, those for are four, and those against are 124. The Noes have it.

(Question negatived.)
			
MR KIWALABYE: Mr Chairman, I wanted to make an amendment.

THE CHAIRMAN: Did you submit the amendment to the Clerk?

MR KIWALABYE: This is a consequential amendment, Mr Chairman.

THE CHAIRMAN: How do I know?

MR KIWALABYE: That –(Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN: The answer is, “I did not”. That is how you should answer.

MR KIWALABYE: Much obliged, Mr Chairman. Article 231(2) also requires the Inspector General of Government to submit that part of the report concerning local authorities and now that we are requiring His Excellency the President to report on what action he has taken on these reports when they are given to him, I think it would be prudent if we required these local authorities to report to Parliament on what actions they have taken on the report of the IGG concerning the local authorities. Since this Parliament has got a Committee on Public Service and Local Government, I think it is proper that they also report.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, I think it is understandable.

DR MAKUBUYA: I am sorry, I have not seen the text of this proposal and I do not know its implications. So really I am not in position to comment on this.

THE CHAIRMAN: The implication is very clear hon. Attorney-General. He is saying that under Article 231(2) copies of reports are sent to the President and it is because of this that the President is required to submit to Parliament what action he has taken - assuming there are actions to be taken by the President. 

In the same constitutional provisions they talk about an extract of the portion of the report on the matter that shall be forwarded to the local authorities. So, he is saying since local authorities receive copies in the same way the President does, they should also report to Parliament so that it can know what actions they have taken. Because the President is most likely to report on matters affecting him as the Executive, the local authorities should also report concerning them. I think that is what he wants to say. Mr Chairman, do you see any problem with it? Well, there is that proposal. Can we vote on it?

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, I have now understood the proposal but I think that it can be taken care of if you look at the proposed sub-Clause (4) and we say, “Action is taken by Government rather than by the President” under which I would think that government is broader and would also incorporate actions taken by the local authorities.

THE CHAIRMAN: I think there is a difference between these governments because when you refer to the Central Government you use a capital “G”, and when you refer to local governments you use a small “g”. That is what it should be.

MR AWORI: Mr Chairman, I was seeking clarification on the timeframe for the President to report –(Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN: Let us exhaust one. Is it a matter over which we need to think about? Then let us vote on hon. Kiwalabye Daniel’s amendment that says that what applies to the President should apply to the local authorities.

MR WOPUWA: Mr Chairman, when you look at the new position, the chief administrative officers who are accounting officers are now being appointed by the Public Service Commission, so as accounting officers they are no longer being held at the local government level.

Two, the –(Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN: We are not talking about the chief administrative officer. We are talking about a local authority; it is different from a chief administrative officer.  

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, is it possible for hon. Daniel Kiwalabye to put his amendment on paper so that we can consider it more appropriately? We can reflect on it and study how it fits in, I would request.

THE CHAIRMAN: No, if you adopt his amendment you say, “The President and or the local authority shall…” Just formulate that one. So I put the question.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position on the proposed amendment to include local authorities is: two abstentions, none against, and those for are 122. The ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that Clause 82 as amended stand part of the Bill –(Interruption)

MR ERESU: Mr Chairman, there is part 5 of Clause 82, which says “Parliament shall discuss expeditiously any report submitted to it under Clause 1.” I was wondering whether the submission from the President to Parliament and Parliament discussing it expeditiously is the end of the matter? I would think after that expeditious discussion by Parliament there should be a provision to give it powers to make recommendations, which must be enforced.  

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question; it is going to be decided by roll call.

THE CHAIRMAN: In the public gallery this morning we have pupils and teachers of Iganga Children’s Centre. The school is in Kigulu South, Iganga District, which constituency is represented in Parliament by hon. Dr Speciosa Wandira Naigaga. Please join me in welcoming them. You are welcome. (Applause)

Honourable members, the position on the motion on Clause 82 is as follows: there were no abstentions, no members voted against it, and 167 members voted for it. The ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 82 as amended agreed to.

Clause 83
 
MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, Clause 83 proposes to amend Article 232 to establish a special court on corruption. The committee examined this and came to the conclusion that this proposed amendment is unnecessary. The reasons are as follows: the proposed special court would not fall under Chapter VIII of the Constitution, which is on the Judiciary. This chapter provides for principles and protects the integrity and independence of the Judiciary and the courts as established under this chapter, but the proposed new special courts do not fall under this. We do not know what rules it will use, what principles will govern it and what independence it will have in order to execute the functions that have been established here. Therefore, the committee proposes that this particular Clause be deleted.

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, corruption is a serious matter, so serious that since government published this Bill we have received a lot of representation on the matter. Therefore, in my judgment we need time to complete our consultations on this matter and we request that this matter be stood over.

THE CHAIRMAN: The minister wants some time to consider this matter. Since there are other clauses, which have been stood over, he will report on this Clause when we deal with them.

Clause 84

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, Clause 84 proposes to introduce a new Article 235(a) to establish a Leadership Code Tribunal. The committee examined this and came to the conclusion that this authority is already given to Parliament under Article 234 of the Constitution, which I would like to read.  Article 234 states; “The Leadership Code of Conduct shall be enforced by the Inspectorate of Government or such other authority as Parliament may by law prescribe.” The committee came to the conclusion that Parliament is already given the authority to establish an institution similar to a tribunal. Therefore, there is no need to create it in the Constitution. We propose that Clause 84 be deleted. 

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, it is my duty to indicate that the Government does not accept the deletion of this Clause. Rather, the Government recommends that this Clause be retained because it enhances the powers of the IGG in the enforcement of the Leadership Code. Therefore, we oppose the recommendation of the committee and move that this Clause be retained in the Bill.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the amendment is that the committee proposes a deletion. 

(Question put.)

 (The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: The results of the voting on the motion by the committee to delete Clause 84 are as follows: there were no abstentions, those for are 26, and 91 are against.

(Question negatived.)

MR MALINGA: Mr Chairman, Article 234 says, “The Leadership Code of Conduct shall be enforced by the Inspectorate of Government or such other authority as Parliament may by law prescribe.” Now we are also saying that, “There shall be a Leadership Code Tribunal, whose composition, jurisdiction and functions shall be prescribed by Parliament by law”. What I am wondering about is, what is the other authority that Parliament can prescribe and how different will it be from the Leadership Code Tribunal?

THE CHAIRMAN: The enforcement will be by the IGG and the tribunal will adjudicate any disputes that may arise there. For example, the IGG may say, “You have not complied with the Leadership Code,” and I may state the reasons why. When there is adjudication that is where the tribunal will come in. I put the question that Clause 84 stand part of the Bill.

(Question put.)

THE CHAIRMAN: The position on Clause 84 to stand part of the Bill is as follows: no abstentions, those against are 17, and those for are 140. The ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 84 agreed to.

Clause 85

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, Clause 85 proposes to amend Article 238 of the Constitution on the Uganda Land Commission. The committee came to the conclusion that the provision of the Constitution is sufficient and Clause 85 should be deleted.

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, the Government accepts that Clause 85 be deleted.

THE CHAIRMAN: I now put the question to the deletion of Clause 85.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members the results of the voting on the motion to delete Clause 85 are as follows: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 104. The ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 85 deleted.

Clause 86

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, Clause 86 proposes to replace the existing Article 244 on minerals. The proposal seeks two things:

To create a new definition for petroleum, therefore, adding more detail in the Constitution and also to talk about rights, which are properly and sufficiently taken care of. The committee argued in its report that the Constitution must declare general principles on which details can be worked by Acts of Parliament and other rules that work for the expansion of the principles in the Constitution. 

The proposals in Article 244 now seek to extend into details that the committee found unnecessary because what is proposed in the Clause is already taken care of in the Constitution and the definition of mineral is also taken care of in the Constitution. We do not know why a new definition for petroleum is being brought up specifically to exclude it from the general definition of minerals. The committee proposes that this Clause be deleted.  

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, government does not accept this recommendation. The amendment is intended to rationalize the provisions of Article 244. The amendment is intended to enable the provision to conform to modern concepts that minerals are vested in the State and that incomes generated there from are shared among stakeholders. For that matter we oppose the recommendation of the committee to delete Clause 86.

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question. 

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position is as follows: no abstentions, those for are 49, and those against are 65.

(Question negatived.)

THE CHAIRMAN: Now let us vote by roll call –(Interruption)

MR BYABAGAMBI: Mr Chairman, I want some clarification from the Attorney-General on why in Clause 86 he started with, “subject to any right granted to any person”, and not “notwithstanding any right granted to any person”? I want clarification on the two. 

MR RUZINDANA: When you look at Article 244(5) that was Clause 3 in the previous Article that we are trying to amend, so I am wondering whether there is any harm in combining Clause 4 and Clause 5 since they deal with definitions in which case Clause 4 would be that mineral means any substance other than petroleum whether in solid, liquid, gaseous and the rest of that? And then add that mineral does not include clay, murram, sand and any stone, rather than having Clause 4 defining mineral and petroleum and you still have Clause 5, which was originally Clause 3, also giving a further definition of minerals. I wonder whether there is any problem putting it together. Thank you.

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, if I may begin with that last point, I think it is the clearest case of good drafting that Clause 4 is talking about what is included, and Clause 5 is talking about what is not included. So they are clearly separated. If you mix them you are inviting problems. What is included is in 4. What is not included is in 5. 

It is not clear what the complaint about sub-Clause (1) is because if there are existing rights, you are not derogating from them. That is the meaning. This is not a Clause for expropriating existing rights. Thank you, Mr Chairman.   

MR MAATE: We would like to know, before we pronounce ourselves on this particular Clause, especially given the fact that I come from the area where we expect to have petroleum and where people expect government to tell them whether this petroleum cannot be taken by somebody without taking care of the interests of the Ugandans and more so the people living around that area. 

According to the statement of Clause (1) where it says that if somebody has a right over the land he may have leased land in the Semliki region, and there is petroleum there. If that person undertakes a venture of exploiting that petroleum, is there any law to prevent that person from taking all the benefits from that petroleum without taking care of the interests of the people? In some countries where exploration of petroleum is done, like in Nigeria, you have heard about insurgencies there; people fighting to make sure that they get a share of such a resource.

The way we have said it is subject to the right granted to the person. Can it not cause a problem when it comes to the sharing of the resource that is being exploited?

DR BATALINGAYA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I want to inform hon. Byabagambi that when he talked of a right, we are here talking of a mineral right. A mineral right means prospecting, exploration, retention and mining itself. That is what we mean. 

And my colleague, hon. Rogers Maate is talking of our petroleum there. I want to refer him to the Petroleum Exploration and Production Act, 1985, Clause (2). That is why we are saying that the minerals are invested in the Government. At the same time, when you go to the Mining Act, 2003 Clause 98, Schedule II where we catered for this law saying that the local government will get this much and an individual will get this much. This law is trying to harmonize that one so that every person in every area, the state, the individual and local government, are catered for. That is what we are trying to say.

At the same time the 1995 Constitution had not brought into light the petroleum that is why we are saying, “minerals and petroleum,” because it is not a renewable recourse. It is every important, very strategic and because it does not occur in every part of Uganda - even hon. Rogers talked about instability. That is why we say that it causes instability, which can be social or political. Therefore, every Ugandan should benefit from the mineral resource of a country.

MR MALINGA: Mr Chairman, I need to be helped. Article 237 of our Constitution states that land in Uganda belongs to the citizens of Uganda and shall be vested in them in accordance with the land tenure system. Here there is a proposed amendment. Let me take a small portion of Clause (1), which says, “Subject to any right granted to any person under any law, the entire property and the control of all minerals and petroleum in on or under any land or waters in Uganda are vested in the Government on behalf of the Republic of Uganda.”

Is this not breaching Article 237? How is our land going to be protected from the power of the Government? Are we not creating a contradiction between Article 237 and Article 244?

MR MWESIGE: Mr Chairman, I wish hon. Malinga had gone further and read Article 237(2) and not stopped at Article 237(1). Article 237(2) says that the right of citizens to land is not obsolete and that notwithstanding Clause (1) of Article 237, Government, or a local government can acquire land in public interest. Of course it is subject to Article 26. So when you are reading the amendment in this Bill, it is important to read 237(1) together with 237(2) and I do not see any conflict between 237(1) and the amendment in the Bill.  

MR LUKYAMUZI: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. This Clause we are trying to pass may create a very negative landmark in our history because of the following. Petroleum is a natural resource and a mineral. Why should petroleum be looked at as having a special status from that which is constitutionally associated to a mineral? I am a Member of the Natural Resources Committee, and we took trouble to examine this area well in advance.  

Secondly -(Interruption)

MRS BBUMBA: Thank you very much hon. Ken Lukyamuzi for giving way. The information I want to give to hon. Ken Lukyamuzi is that there is a clear difference between a mineral and petroleum or hydrocarbons, according to the form of occurrence.  

Petroleum is a hydrocarbon, chemically different from the solid minerals and it also occurs in either liquid of gaseous form. And I want to go further and inform hon. Lukyamuzi, a Member of the Natural Resources Committee, who was very active in enacting the Mining Act, that we drew a clear distinction between minerals in the Mining Act and petroleum is not included. So what we are doing is to capture petroleum and bring it into the law now. There is a separate act for it but we are trying to harmonise the Petroleum Act with the Mine Act and bring them under the constitutional provision.

MR LUKYAMUZI: The scientific definition of petroleum has no relevance to the law we are trying to articulate. However, my concerns are as follows:

We are putting up a law and the nature of the law is that according to my impression that law is not sustainable because it can be taken up by events of constitutional amendment nature. For how long shall we keep on amending the Constitution? 

Lastly, Mr Chairman, I have a clear example of countries like the United Arab Emirates where oil does not exist in every state. It is a federal arrangement where the distribution of the petroleum resource is done according to percentages. Your state does not have to own petroleum before you become the beneficiary. Now that we are moving into a new dispensation of the regional tier and eventually the federal arrangement, shall we keep on amending the Constitution from dispensation to dispensation? I need some clarification on that.  Otherwise, this law you are promulgating is short sighted and could die circumstantially.

MRS BWAMBALE: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would like to clear my mind because during the debate I categorically stated that the definition of a mineral that excludes petroleum makes me uncomfortable. I have questions that remain unanswered - questions that have already been raised by the previous speaker. One of them is Article 237, vesting the land in the people. The question, which is not clear in my mind is, what becomes of the citizens sitting on the land where petroleum is located in relation to Article 237? Is this provision not depriving them of that right that other citizens are enjoying by excluding petroleum? I want that question answered. 

Then Article 26 of the Constitution follows from there. The moment petroleum is excluded from being a mineral, such citizens can no longer be protected and can no longer be paid. Instead it is being covered under Article 244(6) where now it is again being pushed to the future. Let me read it: “Parliament may regulate the exploitation of any substance excluded from the definition of mineral under this Article, when exploited for commercial purposes”.   

My question is, which mineral is not for commercial purposes? Even clay, murram, sand and stone are also used for commercial purposes. So this sub-Clause (6) is not clear to me. I still maintain the position that I advanced that during the debate that as far as we are concerned, Article 244 as stated in the Constitution should pertain, unless the minister explains to the people concerned. Otherwise, I submit that petroleum remains a mineral as it was envisaged in the Constituent Assembly. 

MR WACHA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I want the minister to tell me why Clause (1) is not specifically subjected to Article 26? Why do we not subject this specifically to Article 26? If we did then the hon. Maate and hon. Loyce Bwambale’s fears could be taken care of. Why do we fear to subjecting it to 26?

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, what the hon. Ben Wacha has said is exactly the question I wanted to raise. The reading of Clause 244(1), particularly the last part, says, “Notwithstanding any right of ownership of or by any person in relation to any land in, on or under which any such minerals or petroleum are found”. This is a major statement. It is not qualified by Article 237(2), which the honourable minister stated, because Article 237(2) is very carefully drafted. It subjects all acquisition of land to Article 26. That means that they subject it to adequate and timely compensation.  

But this Article does not do that. It is notwithstanding any of those rights and that is why the committee had proposed that it should be deleted, Sir, but we lost on that.

THE CHAIRMAN: You go and discuss it then we shall come back to pronounce ourselves on it. We should have lunch and meanwhile, as you are there, you continue to remove what is unconstitutional as far as the Constitution is concerned so that we come back at 3.00 p.m.

1.54
THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS/ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Dr Khiddu Makubuya): Mr Speaker, I beg to make this report in two parts. In part 1, the Committee of the whole House on the 15th of July this year considered clauses 65 to 80 and took the following decisions:

COMMITTEE STAGE

THE CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT NO. 3) BILL, 2005

3.32
Clause 86

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, we took your advice and consulted over lunch. We propose that Article 244(1) should now read as follows: “Subject to Article 26 of this Constitution, the entire property in the control of all minerals and petroleum in on or under any land or waters in Uganda are vested in the Government on behalf of the Republic of Uganda.”  The “notwithstanding” and “found”, are crossed out.

THE CHAIRMAN: Therefore it means full, adequate and prompt compensation before you acquire them. Should I now put the question?

MR OCHIENG: Mr Chairman, I would like to seek your guidance. Article 244(3) says, “For the purpose of this Article, ‘minerals’ does not include clay, murram, sand or any stone commonly used for building or similar purposes.”  There is an element of sand. We know that some varieties of sand are used for glass and most of this is usually found along lakeshores. I want to know, in that case, what happens. There seems to be a generalisation of sand here, and if it is to be used for that purpose, how do we get the good out of our resource?

THE CHAIRMAN: What problem are you trying to solve?

MR OCHIENG: My problem is, how do people get to know that they have that type of sand? How do we safeguard people who get to know about it from taking away what could be of value to the community? We need to define this properly so that we do not lose minerals of value. 

DR BATALINGAYA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would like to refer hon. Ochieng to the Mining Act. There is what we call “building minerals” and “industrial minerals”. In this category you find the varieties of sand where his concern of glass and building would be answered.

MR MALINGA: Mr Chairman, I am happy about the amendment brought by the minister, and to avoid any doubt I would like this amendment to read, “Subject to Articles 26 and 237 of this Constitution –(Interruption)  

DR EPETAIT: I would like to inform hon. Malinga that Article 237 is also subjected to Article 26. I think his case should be put to rest.

MR MALINGA: I beg to withdraw.

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question to the amendment. 

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position on the motion to amend as proposed by the minister is: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 99. The ayes have it.
  
(Question agreed to.)

MR KASIGWA: Mr Chairman, sub-Clause (3) appears irrelevant in the Bill, since there is sub-Clause (2)(b). I propose that sub-Clause (3) be deleted.

THE CHAIRMAN: Why do you propose the deletion?

MR KASIGWA: Mr Chairman, we are talking of sharing loyalties and interest of the landowners of the local governments and the central government. Since we are talking of revenue that will be derived from the sale of petroleum, I do not see why we should go ahead and have sub-Clause (3) as part of the Bill.

THE CHAIRMAN: Sometimes even court systems have damages that cannot be calculated in terms of money. There may be certain interests that one does not want for compensation and yet they are in the provision.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, in the public gallery we have constituents from Jinja Municipality who are here to watch the proceedings of the House. They are represented in Parliament by hon. Nasani Nabeta, Minister of State for Trade. You are welcome.

The results of the voting on Clause 86 as amended are: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 178. The ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 86 as amended, agreed to.

Clause 87
 
MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, Clause 87 proposes to replace Article 248 of the Constitution on the Uganda Law Reform Commission.  The Committee concluded that the power given to Parliament to enact the details of the Laws relating to Uganda Law Reform Commission is sufficient.  The proposal overloads the Constitution and therefore it is unnecessary to have these matters in the Constitution.  There is already an Act of Parliament relating to the Uganda Law Reform Commission. We propose the deletion of this Clause.

Dr Makubuya: Mr Chairman, Government agrees that Clause 87 of the Bill be deleted.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the motion is that we delete –(Interruption)

MR LUKYAMUZI: Mr Chairman, I have instructions from my constitutional committee, Lubaga South, to seek the following clarification. The Article referred to is attached to the obligation that Parliament prescribes an enabling Law until they are implemented. They think the existing provision is redundant since there are many such provisions. Doesn’t that redundancy affect the success of the Constitution?

THE CHAIRMAN: Are you disagreeing with the report of the Committee, which says there is an Act?

MR LUKYAMUZI: I am not disagreeing but I am saying that there are so many provisions of that kind which are lacking because of –(Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN: Then the Committee informs you that there is an Act. I put the question. 

(Question put.)
  
(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position to delete Clause 87 is, Abstention – 0, No – 0, Aye – 141. The Ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 87 deleted.

Clause 88

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, Clause 88 proposes to insert new Article 248(a) creating functions for the Uganda Law Reform Commission. This is unnecessary since they are already contained in an Act of Parliament. We propose a deletion.
 
DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, Government agrees that Clause 88 be deleted from the Bill. 
 
MR CHAIRMAN: I put the question. 

(Question put.)
 
(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

MR CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the result on deletion of Clause 88 is as follows: Abstentions – 0, No – 0, Aye – 148. The Ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 88 deleted.

Clause 89

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, Clause 89 proposes to delete Article 249 of the Constitution. Article 249 creates the Disaster Preparedness and Management Commission. The Committee found out that Government has just launched the IDP policy, which recognises the potential of the problems of displacement caused by both human and natural disasters.

Secondly, this country has experienced several disasters and responses have been on an adhoc basis.  In the wake of a similar incident, all efforts should be taken towards having departments of this nature to deal with the problem. We propose that this clause be deleted.

Dr Makubuya: Mr Chairman, Government agrees that clause 89 is deleted. 

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the vote on the motion is as follows: Abstentions – 0, No – 0, For – 138. The motion carried.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 89 deleted.

Clause 90

Mr Oulanyah: Mr Chairman, clause 90 proposes to amend Article 250 of the Constitution on the remedies available against Government. The proposed amendment seeks to bar absolutely any remedy of any injunction, order of eviction or specific performance against Government. The Committee is of the view that this is not justifiable.

The protections given to Government by the laws are sufficient; the enlargement of this provision is against the doctrine of effective remedy. We propose that it should be deleted. 

Dr Makubuya: Mr chairman, Government agrees that Clause 90 be deleted from the Bill.

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question. 

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position is as follows: Abstentions – 0, No – 0, Ayes – 146

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 90 deleted.

Clause 91

MR Oulanyah: Mr chairman, Clause 91 proposes to replace Article 255 on referenda generally. It is necessary to give a very short background that the debate on the sovereignty of the people and the bigger debates that surrounded it had previously been tied around the amendment of Article 1. The Committee went into talks and we discussed this several times with the Government and the amendment of Article 1 was dropped.  

The amendment that is now proposed in clause 91 is meant to create this new provision, which the Committee has agreed to. But the Committee felt it necessary to make an amendment to this effect. To insert two new clauses after the proposed clause 2 to read as follows:

“(3) Parliament shall by law prescribe the binding effect of a referendum held under this article; and 
(4) a referendum held under this article shall not affect; 
(a)	Any fundamental and other human rights and freedoms guaranteed under Chapter 4 of this Constitution. 
(b)	The power of the courts to question the validity of the referendum.”

The justification is to empower Parliament by an Act of Parliament to prescribe the binding effect of a referendum under Article 255 without derogating from the fundamental and other human rights and freedoms guaranteed under Chapter 4 of the Constitution or the power of the courts to question the validity of the referendum once held.

We propose that clause 91 be adopted with the amendment from the Committee.  

Mr Mwesige: Mr Chairman, we do not have fundamental differences with the committee but if the chairman allows, we have a slight modification in his amendments. The modification is that the binding effect of the referendum held under Article 255 should be provided for in the Constitution.

The justification for this modification is that referendum is a creature of the Constitution, it therefore, follows consequentially that its effect is also constitutionalized.  

So, we are proposing that where a referendum is held under this article, the result of that referendum shall be binding on all organs and agencies of the State and on all persons under organisations. But we further agree with the Committee that a referendum held under this clause should exempt the fundamental and human rights and freedoms of the individual guaranteed under Chapter 4 of the Constitution.  

We also propose to reserve the power of the courts of judicature to question the validity of a referendum once held. Validity in this provision includes both the propriety of the referendum and the procedure through which the referendum has been conducted. 

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, I have just proposed an amendment and the Government has just proposed an amendment, if there is a discussion we rather have it before we come to any conclusion.

THE CHAIRMAN: Do you see a problem with this amendment?

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, in the absence of any interjections, I concede to the honourable minister. (Applause)

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, I put the question. The amendment we have is this one, which you have.

MR MWESIGE: That is right.

MR ANANG-ODUR:  Mr Chairman, I am begging that - I wish our microphone could be returned. We have become a total inconvenience to our neighbours by pushing them around because we do not have a microphone here.

Mr Chairman, I wish to amend 91.3.

THE CHAIRMAN: Do we have 91.3?

MR ANANG-ODUR: Yes, amendment of the one, which has been proposed by the Government. 

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay.

MR ANANG-ODUR: I want to insert the words on the second line after shall, “a referendum shall subject to the provisions of this constitution”, so that it reads in full, “where a referendum is held under this article, the result of the referendum shall subject to the provisions of this Constitution, be binding on all organs and agencies of the state and all persons and organisations in Uganda”.

MR MWESIGE: Mr Chairman, with due respect to my distinguished hon. Odur, I oppose the amendment with the following reasons. First of all, we have created exceptions to the general rule. The general rule is that, a referenda once held its results shall be binding provided or subject to, if you want me to say, fundamental and human rights and freedoms cannot be a subject of referenda. That is really the proviso that in my view you seek to introduce in the main body of this clause.

The second proviso that we have made is that the power of the courts – the independence of the courts and the power of the courts to question any referendum held under this clause has been preserved. I therefore, do not see the compelling reason to introduce another proviso or another subject in the body of clause 3. I would persuade my colleague hon. Odur to respectfully withdraw the amendment.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable minister, I think let us go on this way. Do you see any harm other than drafting purposes if that is inserted? Does it create any problem where you are saying it is redundant?

MR MWESIGE: I think it does Sir, because it – subject to all the provisions of the Constitution - is too wide for me to ascertain. That is why we singled out fundamental human rights and the power of the courts. But subjecting the referendum to all other provisions is to negate its importance, its meaning and its effect. So I do not see -(Interruption)- 

THE CHAIRMAN: What he is saying is that it should not override an existing provision of the constitution. If it becomes irrelevant, it is irrelevant. It may be unnecessary, I agree, but does it cause any harm?

MR RUKUTANA: Mr Chairman, I think the spirit of this article is to provide for supremacy of a decision by referendum to any other provision of the Constitution. If you subject it to other clauses of the Constitution, you are giving with one hand, and taking away with another.  

So, while I have not examined all the other provisions, I think the intention was to ensure that no other law – no other provision of the constitution takes precedence over a decision. -(Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN: Then why don’t you say, notwithstanding any other provisions of the Constitution?

MR RUKUTANA: That would be a better phrasing.

THE CHAIRMAN: If that is what you want –(Interruption)

MR ANANG-ODUR: Mr Chairman, the reason why I feel this amendment should be made is that first of all, we agree even the supremacy of the population according to our Constitution is itself subject to the Constitution. This country is ruled according to the Constitution not any other law or any other decisions, which are made either by the people or whoever. If you are going to make a decision as a people and we have got a Constitution, I think it is very important for us to ensure that we do it in accordance with the Constitution.

If we want to change a Constitution I think we have to follow the procedures, which are laid down in the Constitution because what is being provided for here is to by-pass a Constitution and I think it is not correct. In fact this is the very reason why the first amendment was rejected and withdrawn. But now I see it being brought back through the window and I feel – I am a bit surprised that my colleague - my brother does not agree with me on this.

I would feel that he should be the first person to defend this Constitution and ensure that we do things according to the constitutional provisions to the country. I beg to appeal to my colleagues that this amendment should be carried.

MR AMAMA MBABAZI:  Mr Chairman, first of all, it is not necessary to have redundancies in the Constitution. It is Article 1, which talks about the sovereignty of the people in decision-making and that subjects that process to the provisions of the Constitution. It is clear already in Article 1. 

What is being proposed here is that for avoidance of doubt, where an issue has gone to the people and they have voted, the outcome of that vote is binding on everyone. Then it goes on to say that however, as the minister just explained, in the areas of fundamental and other human rights, this right will not extend. 

So, it is not necessary to repeat that “subject to the Constitution” and especially when you say so, you bring doubt about the effect of the proposed clause 4. Actually, it may get some of this. If it is redundant, why have it? My proposal, therefore, to hon. Odur is that he should not pursue that matter because it is well covered, very clearly covered.

THE CHAIRMAN: Well honourable member, may be you can take comfort in 4(b). The power of the courts to question the validity of the Referendum – so, if you think somehow this referendum might have conflicted with other relevant provisions of the Constitution, then you invoke the powers of court to say it is invalid because it has conflicted with this one which you think. Your problem may be addressed by 4(b) although if it was not a question of redundancy, the other one also could have worked. But this 4(b) could take care of your fear.  Can I put the question?

MR MWONDHA: We have run away from hon. Odur’s proposal because of redundancy, but in the process are we not creating unnecessary litigation? Really, why should we have to run to court for a matter which we can solve here by legislation?

THE CHAIRMAN: But you see again you will have to run to court because that is where you will say this conflicted with the provision of the Constitution. It is only the court that will be able to do so. In any case if you have a cause of action and you go to court, it is not a waste of time; it is your right and the courts are there to precisely do that.

MR KIKUNGWE: Mr Chairman, what I get out of this is that if I am free to go to court, the referendum will have taken place and that means resources will have been wasted, assuming the courts found something wrong with the process.  Like hon. Patrick Mwondha is saying, why don’t we handle the situation here and now?  

THE CHAIRMAN: You see, honourable members, as I told you earlier, we make a number of laws here, we make amendments to the Constitution, but we are not the ones to interpret the laws we make. So, even if we put it there, somebody will say, “No, this is not against the Constitution. You will have to go to court for adjudication from a competent court with jurisdiction”. So, you cannot avoid court if you have a dispute. If you do not, then there will be no problem.

MR ONEK: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I want us to read Article 1(1), “All power belongs to the people who shall exercise their sovereignty in accordance with this Constitution”. So, even that power which belongs to the people has to be exercised with in this Constitution. So, what Odur brought is just to insert to emphasize that point with respect to the referendum. I do not see any contradiction. We could just simply add his amendment and it will be in accordance with Article 1(1), which states clearly that, “The power of the people shall be exercised in accordance with the Constitution”.  

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would like the Chairman of the Committee to clarify to me. When you say, “The results of the referendum shall be binding on all organs and agencies of the State, on all persons and organisations in Uganda”, and then you go down in 4(b) and you say, “The referendum to which clause 3 applies shall not affect the powers of the courts to question the validity of the referendum”. So, is this not a bit of confusion?

THE CHAIRMAN: You see, honourable members, what you do under the Constitution must be validly done. If it is not validly done, then you have not exercised the powers given to you under that Constitution.  You cannot just say this is a referendum result if it has not been properly conducted under the Constitution and under the law.

MR LUKYAMUZI: Mr Chairman, out of the proposed amendment, I have noted two important points.
1.	The amendment seeks to breach a vacuum, which could cause chaos and avoid misdeed. 
2.	Out of the passed litigation experiences in courts of law, what precedents have been created in support of the litigants? The answer is “No”. So, he has a valid point for proposition.  

Look at the Supreme Court judgments on the Constitution, et cetera, et cetera, you will see.  What have we managed to implement? The judges have given their verdict, but the judgement has been redundant; it has not corrected any wrong. I think we should support him.  

MR RUHINDI: Mr Chairman, the Constitution is what you make it to be. We are here making the Constitution. So, in response to hon. Onek’s observation, all we are saying is - we are citing Article 1 to say, “Which shall in accordance with the Constitution”. So, that is what we are making now. In other words, when you are exercising the rights under Article 1, you will refer to Article 90 that we are making now. There is absolutely no contradiction and what we are actually trying to emphasize is the supremacy like hon. Rukutana said. There is supremacy of that decision subject to the following and there is absolutely no contradiction.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable member, are you still pursuing your amendment so that we vote on it?  

MR ANANG-ODUR: Mr Chairman, I am sorry to say that I find difficulty in being convinced by my colleagues because I still feel that the provision in (b) they are talking about will not be as strong as the one I proposed. My feeling is that it will be better to state categorically that we are subjecting this decision to the provisions of the Constitution other than leaving it in a very vague manner.

Secondly, Mr Chairman, I did not see the redundancy we are talking about because in these other clauses we have passed, we have made similar provisions subjecting certain provisions to others because of the importance of the question. So, I totally believe that we should be constitutional, we should carry out our work to promote good governance and this is the best way I feel it could be done.

THE CHAIRMAN: There are two amendments. There is an amendment by the Minister and that amendment has been amended by hon. Anang-Odur by putting “subject to the Constitution.”  Can we vote on his amendment first?

MR NSUBUGA NSAMBU: Mr Chairman, I wish to draw your attention to the fact that these laws we are making here have got to be respected by the present Parliament. But if principles of Parliamentary legislation do not find a future Parliament, they can be altered any time by a second Parliament.  But here we appear to be almost giving ordained laws, which cannot be changed, which I think is really outside our position. We should take what the Chairman had proposed. 

This amendment goes very far even to affect the future Parliaments. In the circumstances, I feel we should probably take this back for another re-drafting to see how it can work, but this one will not work.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, future Parliaments will be affected by the Constitution they will find in existence. Until such a time following the procedure laid down in the Constitution, they will change the provision. That is clear. A future Parliament may come and amend but must follow the existing Constitution in amending. So, I put the question on hon. Anang-Odur’s proposed amendment.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands__)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position is as follows for the motion by hon. Anang-Odur. Abstentions - two, for - 20, against – 107. The motion lost.

(Question negatived.)

THE CHAIRMAN: Now we vote on the motion by the honourable Minister and Attorney General.

THE CHAIRMAN:  Hon. Ken Lukyamuzi let us be orderly.  You stood here changed and we marked you.  This is the third time you are changing, why?  Honourable members, the position on clause 91 as amended is: abstention – 4, No – 18 and Aye 159.  The Ayes have it; the motion is carried. (Applause)

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 91 agreed to.

Clause 92

MR OULANYAH:  Mr Chairman, clause 92 proposes to amend Article 257 in respect of two definitions, “financial year” and “minister”.  The committee came to the conclusion that this is not justifiable. The committee recommends that Article 257 should not be amended in a term proposed by the Government, this would produce uncertainty in the planning and cause uncertainty in many laws that have governed the budget process over the years.  The proposed amendment is unnecessary and Clause 92 should be deleted.

MR MWESIGE: Mr Chairman, the Government accepts the committee’s recommendation.

THE CHAIRMAN:  Okay. I now put the question.  The motion is to delete.

(Question put.)
  
(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the motion to delete: Abstentions-0 Against-0 and Ayes- 124.  The motion is carried. (Applause)

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 92 deleted.

Clause 93

MR OULANYAH:  Mr Chairman, Clause 93 proposes to repeal Article 257(a) introduced by Constitutional (Amendment) Act, 2000, that Act was nullified by the court. We would like to take a decision on Clause 35.  The committee recommends that the provision was already explained by the courts of law, there is no need repealing it here. We propose deletion of Clause 93.

MR MWESIGE: Mr Chairman, Government accepts the committee’s recommendation. (Applause)

THE CHAIRMAN:  I now put the question. 

(Question put.)
   
(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: The position is: Abstention-0, Against-0 and Ayes 126. Motion carried.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 93 deleted.

Clause 94

MR ANANG ODUR:  Mr Chairman, I move this motion on behalf of hon. Okulo Epak. Now Clause 94 proposes repeal of a number of articles in the Constitution.  I am moving to amend Clause 94, which would repeal Article 285. My amendment is to repeal Clause 94 so that we restore Article 285 and maintain the status quo of the Constitution in this respect.  

Mr Chairman, this is to avoid state leases reverting back to the urban authorities.  This is the effect of this particular provision.

THE CHAIRMAN:  Now, is it your intention to restore these statutory leases, do they exist now after the coming into force of the Constitution, they do not.  Article 285 says: “ Upon the coming into force of this Constitution- that was 8 October 1995- and subject to the provision of paragraph (a) of Clause (2) of Article 237 of this Constitution, statutory leases to urban authorities shall cease to exist.”  So, they cease to exist.

MR ANANG-ODUR:  So, Mr Chairman, that question does not arise? 

THE CHAIRMAN:  Okay, you explain, honourable member.  On that day- 1995, this ceased to exist and what used to be statutory leases were vested in District Land Board and that is the status quo now.

MR MALINGA:  Mr Chairman, I need to be helped here.
  
THE CHAIRMAN:  No, let us exhaust this. 

MR MALINGA: On the same, Sir. My understanding is that when we delete Article 285, it means we are reintroducing the statutory leases to urban authorities.

THE CHAIRMAN: By what law will they acquire the statutory leases, which were taken from them in 1995 unless they apply to District Land Boards to be given? Apparently there is a thinking that District Land Boards belong to those local authorities. Urban authorities think that because they caused the constituting of the District Land Boards, the land process belongs to them.

MR ANANG-ODUR: Mr Chairman, I see the Minister consulting, but I am satisfied with the explanation. I withdraw this amendment.

THE CHAIRMAN: what is the position on Clause 94.

MR OULANYAH: Sir, Clause 94, we have no comment on it.

THE CHAIRMAN: So, roll call.

MR LUKYAMUZI: Mr Chairman, clarification on Clause 94. 

THE CHAIRMAN: But excuse me, honorable members, can you explain these provisions which you see in Clause 94. We put them there during the Constituent Assembly under the transition Chapter.  They were for a duration, which has ended. That is the reason we are repealing them.

MR LUKYAMUZI: Mr Chairman, much obliged. But permit me to seek guidance from the Attorney General in regard to the implications of the Repeal of the 1967 Constitution and Legal Notice No.1 1986.  

While I am not opposing the contents of the proposal, I would like to be guided. What are the legal consequences of the repeal of these provisions in a situation where at one time these laws were a basis of Government? 

The example I want to give is that in 1984 children of the victims of those who participated in the Second World War in Vietnam went to court and sought redress over what had happened to them 50 years ago and the American Government compensated them.  

As an ordinary Uganda representing a number of people, I would like to know whether it is enough to say we are repealing these laws without having in mind a possibility of causing further consequences in the future. That is the inquiry I would like to humbly request the learned Attorney General on behalf of the people I represent.

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, hon. Lukyamuzi is advised to inform the people he represents as follow. Article 287 and Article 287 reads like this: “Subject to articles 263 and 264 of this Constitution, the Constitution of Uganda of 1967 and Legal Notice No.1 of 1986 as amended, shall upon the coming into force of this Constitution, stand repealed. 

This Constitution came into force on the 8th day of October 1995, on that day the Constitution of Uganda 1967 and Legal Notice NO.1 of 1986, stood repealed.  Now what you are talking about is the matter of vested rights. Supposing I had acquired some rights under the 1967 Constitution and Legal Notice No.1 of 1986, what is effect of this repeal? 

What is the effect of repeal of the law on vested rights? The law that applied at that time will apply if you can make this very clear to the people of Lubaga South that the effect of the law of limitation, if they acquired some vested rights under the Seventh Constitution and the Legal Notice of 1986, those rights will remain obtaining subject to the law of limitation. I thank you, Mr Chairman.

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that Clause 94 stand part of the bill.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 94 agreed to.

Clause 95

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, Clause 95 proposes to introduce ten new articles on transition; it proposes to add to the existing constitutional provisions, ten more provisions in relation to the term of the current Parliament, the term of local councils, provisions relating to the Uganda Police Force, Prisons Service, Modification of laws, bodies whose membership has changed, preservation of rights in respect of the existing offices, existing constituencies, Movement organs to continue.  These are the proposed headings of the new articles that are proposed for transition.  The Committee examined this, Mr Chairman, and came to the following conclusions and now I recommend as follows:

In the proposed new Article 288, the term of the current Parliament to end with that of the President. The Committee proposes Article 288 in Clauses 2, 3 and 4, be deleted.  The reason for this is that the committee approved the shortening of the term of Parliament to whatever period that would be catered for under Article 1. But the implication of this shortening should be handled administratively rather than having it in the transition of provisions of the Constitution.  

The Committee approves Article 289.  The Committee approves the proposed Article 290 on the term of the local government council, based on the decisions that the Parliament has taken on Clauses 69, 70, 71 and 72 of the bill.

Deleting provisions relating to the Uganda Police Force, the Committee recommends that proposed Article 291 be deleted.  Proposed Article 292, which relates to the Prisons Service, following the decision of the Parliament on Clauses 73, 74 and 75 of the bill, the Committee proposes that the proposed Article 292 also be deleted.

THE CHAIRMAN: Excuse me, if I may ask, because what I have, I do not seem to be following you at all.  Because when you come to this Clause 95, which is in number 73 on page 15, the last part, I do not see anything.

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, these are the implications of what is proposed in our Paragraph 73.  If you look at first part, that is deletion of 2, 3 and 4 with the justification that the next deletion to delete proposed Articles 291 and 292.

THE CHAIRMAN: But this is what I have.

MR LUKYAMUZI: Mr Chairman, I am equally in a dilemma because as a Member of Parliament representing Kampala, Article 289 is reading differently and the committee chairman is jumping the articles, so I do not know where I am. I am insisting that Kampala should be clarified.

THE CHAIRMAN: No, the position is this, the report, which you are reading is not contained in the copy which I have.

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, I stand up to make two points; the first one (Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN: We are dealing with the written report by the committee.

DR MAKUBUYA: Yes, Sir and that is what I am going to comment on. I think that Parliament should give the chairman time to reconcile the record you have with the record he has so that we can move in tandem.  

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, I do not know whether I created confusion but I was merely elaborating on what is contained in the report based on the decisions that we have already taken and that is all. For example if we talk about Article 291, the proposed Article 291 is supposed to be a transitional provision relating to the Uganda Police Force.  However, we have already taken decisions in relation to Uganda Police Force in Clauses 69, 70, 71 and 72 by deleting all of them. Therefore, the transitional provision in the proposed Article 292 would be redundant and that is why we are proposing that it should be deleted. It is in consonance with what is contained in page 15 of the report.

MS KIRASO: Mr Chairman, I would like your guidance on this procedural matter. Given that Clause 95 has got so many aspects to it, is it possible for us to deal with Article 288 under Clause 95 and we dispose of that before going to the next one? This might help us not to lose focus and is certainly better than the chairman of the committee commenting on each of them and us not knowing what we are going to discuss and what we are going to vote on. These issues are different yet they are lumped up in one Clause.  

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, I do not know whether you are able to follow or whether we need time to –(Interjections)- are you in position to debate or express views on this or do you think that we should handle other Clauses instead and deal with this tomorrow?

HON. MEMBERS: No.

MOTION FOR THE HOUSE TO RESUME

THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS/ATTORNEY GENERAL (Dr Khiddu Makubuya): Mr Chairman, I beg to move that the House do resume to enable the Committee of the Whole House to report thereto.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, the motion is that we adopt the report of the Committee which the minister has just made to us.

(Question put and agreed to.)

MR OULANYAH: Mr Speaker, it would be appropriate at this time to reflect on the short history of this country from 1995 when this Constitution was promulgated. Many people, including myself, have strongly objected to the operations of Article 269 and today I must record my appreciation that Article 269 has finally died a natural death. Thank you.  (Applause)

THE SPEAKER: Honorable members, normally the Cabinet sits on Wednesday but this time I have been informed by the Prime Minister that there will be no Cabinet tomorrow, therefore, we shall start the proceedings at 10.00 a.m. prompt. With this, we come to the end of today’s sitting –(Interruption)

MR EKANYA: Mr Speaker, just one clarification.  We would like to know when the resolution on districts would be here so that we inform our constituencies to be prepared. 

THE SPEAKER: Well, I do not know whether the Minister of Local Government is here or –(Interruption)

PROF. NSIBAMBI: Mr Speaker, honorable members, I was informed this afternoon that this matter will be handled tomorrow.  I thank you.

THE SPEAKER: This brings us to the end of today’s sitting. The House is adjourned until tomorrow at 10.00 a.m.

(The House rose at 6.25 p.m. and adjourned to Wednesday, 20 July 2005 at 10.00 a.m.)
