COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: The Member for Mbarara Municipality, is she around?  She is not.

MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT TO AUTHORISE GOVERNMENT TO BORROW FROM THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY (IDA) OF THE WORLD BANK SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS 19.6 MILLION FOR THE THIRD STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAMME (SAP)

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, you will recall that debate on this item was concluded and I could not put the question because we were under quorum and by the look of things, I cannot do it for the same reasons; and until we are able to mobilise a quorum, I shall suspend the proceedings for 15 minutes. It is to mobilise yourselves, to make the quorum.

(The proceedings were suspended at 2.17 p.m)

(On resumption at 2.38 p.m, the Speaker presiding_)

THE SPEAKER: All those hon. Members who are outside the Chambers, come in so that we take a head count. All those hon. Members who are lobbying, elsewhere within the precincts of Parliament come in to the Chamber so that we take a head count.

(A head count of the Members present was taken)

THE SPEAKER: I am sorry we have not been able to realise a quorum; I shall adjourn the House until 2 o’clock tomorrow.

(The House rose at 2.46 p.m. and adjourned until Wednesday, 18th April, 2001 at 2.00 p.m.)
