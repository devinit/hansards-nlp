Parliament met at 2.50 p.m. in Parliament House, Kampala. 

PRAYERS 

(The Speaker, Mr Edward Ssekandi, in the Chair.) 

The House was called to order. 

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR 

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I welcome you. I would like to remind the relevant committee, namely, the Budget Committee that the budgeting process as far as Parliament is concerned has started. We received the necessary documents for the committee to sit and consider in order to write the report that we shall send to the President some time in May. So, I am urging you to mobilise the various chairpersons to start the process, because I see that we have a problem that there may be a session that may interrupt our work. So, the sooner you start on the work the better for us. 

2.54
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON BUDGET (Ms Rose Akol):  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to inform the Minister of Finance present that we only received one copy that was laid on Table, but the various sessional committees need copies of the Budget Framework Paper in order to start their work.  

So, as we talk now, the only copy I received as chairperson is the one which was laid on Table. But in order for me to compile a report, the various sessional committees need to prepare their reports and then forward them to the Committee on Budget. But they cannot do so unless they have copies of this document. Perhaps if the Minister of Finance can assure us that this document will be here maybe today at 5.00 p.m. then committees can start their work tomorrow, Mr Speaker. 

2.55
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Fred Omach): I thank you, Mr Speaker. We shall make sure that the copies are available by tomorrow.  

THE SPEAKER: Okay thank you very much. I would again like to remind the committee working on the Auditor-General’s report that sometime back – at the end of last year - we were supposed to have appointed the auditor to the Office of the Auditor-General, but so far this has not been done. So, I am also requesting the committee to expedite the process so that we can get an auditor to the Auditor-General. 

2.56
MR HENRY BANYENZAKI (NRM, Rubanda County West, Kabale):  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am a member of the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development which is handling that issue and we have already finished handling that matter. We are only waiting for a slot on the order paper so that we can table the report and the recommendations.

THE SPEAKER: Okay, thank you  very  much.

MINISTERIAL STATEMENT ON THE SHOOTING INCIDENT IN NTINDA

2.56
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr Matia Kasaija): Hon. Members, last week I promised to shed light on an unfortunate and sad incident that took place at Ntinda on the 28 March 2011. This incident led to the death of one Lukyamuzi Tony and Lubingo Augustine, and also caused injury to six other persons. I wish to use the same opportunity to communicate another similar incident that took place at Kyambogo during which several, apparently innocent Ugandans, lost their lives and others were injured. The regrettable deaths and injuries were a result of an uncalled for mob justice. 

The Ntinda incidence

On 28 March 2011, two people riding on a motorcycle were moving from Nateete to Kireka via Ntinda and Nakawa. At Ntinda, they almost caused an accident with an Ipsum car. Occupants of the car shouted words that the riders were thieves. When other riders heard this, they chased the two riders through Ssemawata Road towards Ntinda Trading Centre. The two riders were intercepted and beaten up and the Police was called in to save the suspects. 

But unfortunately, the Police found one of the suspects already dead while the other one was still alive but being beaten up. The mob was preparing to burn the body of the one who had died. The Police commanded by a one PC Njala, the only one who had a weapon, rescued the suspect who was still alive.  The other Police officers whisked him away to the station to save him from being killed. PC Njala remained guarding the body of the other rider, Kikambi Robert, whose body the mob wanted to burn.  

At this moment, the mob surged towards PC Njala. To scare the crowd away, PC Njala shot in the air and the crowd briefly retreated only to gather moments later. The crowd, now bigger, surged forward and surrounded PC Njala shouting words to the effect that the Police officer should be killed and alleging that the Police always protect thieves. 

The crowd then pushed PC Njala intending to disarm him. In the process, through panic, PC Njala released some bullets and unfortunately, as a result, a motorcycle rider, Lukyamuzi Tony, was shot in the head and another person Lubingo Augustine was shot in the stomach and died on the way to hospital a few minutes later. Six other people were injured in the incident.
 
It should be noted that PC Njala, the only one who was armed is a trained officer. His action was, therefore, questioned and this is why he was arrested and produced in court last Friday and the process is still going on. 

The Police secured statements from Police officers involved in the incidence and statements were also obtained from other witnesses. We also obtained a statement from Pvt. Kamya of CMI who stated that the motorcycle which was presumably being stolen was his and that Lukyamuzi Tony was his rider. Unfortunately, the Ipsum car and its occupants have up to date not been traced. Therefore, they have not made a statement to verify especially the accident that was supposedly caused by those two riders. That ends the statement on the Ntinda incident. But as I said, I also want to report on the Kyambogo incident and see how to conclude this matter. 

On  26 March 2011, two people riding a  motorcycle from Naalya-Kiwatule-Ntinda towards Kyambogo were being chased by other motorcycle riders who were shouting that those being chased were thieves. As they approached Kyambogo, the two riders were arrested by other motorcycle riders who proceeded to take them towards the Ntinda Police Station. However, midway to Ntinda, the mob that was marching the two suspects to the Police station changed their minds and decided to march back towards Kyambogo. On the way, the two suspects were beaten up and their heads smashed using huge stones. The mob got petrol intending to burn the suspects. It was at this moment that the Police arrived and used tear gas to disperse the crowd. The two people who died in this incident remain unknown as they carried no identification on them. 

Secondly, the motorcycle that they allegedly stole has not been recovered to date. It is sad to note that mob justice may have resulted into the loss of two innocent lives. This matter is still under Police investigations. 

It is very unfortunate that despite the Police Force’s continuous intense mobilisation and sensitisation through community policing methods, some people still engage in the vice of mob justice. This vice has resulted into a number of deaths, many unreported. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, through the Police Force will continue sensitising and mobilising the population against the practice. 

These two incidents, and others similar, point to the urgent need for all of us to be involved in the fight against mob justice. I beg to move. 

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much, honourable minister. 

3.04
MR SAMUEL ODONGA OTTO (FDC, Aruu County, Pader): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I thank the minister for responding to the questions I raised last week about the incidents in Ntinda. I seek clarification from the minister. Can I have the SD reference number and the code numbers of PC Njala for reference? I want PC Njala’s surname, the details of the court numbers and the details of the file numbers opened at the Police station because we do not want this to be an incident where people are arrested and released after three or five days and you cannot follow up whether the accused or the suspect is facing the law. I need these particular details. 

Secondly, honourable minister, I think we should desist from blaming the victim at every scene of the crime because in paragraph 3, the minister states: “Mr Speaker, the regrettable deaths and injuries were a result of uncalled for mob justice…” we seem to be blaming the deaths of these two Ugandans on the mob justice of the other people, but in paragraph 6, you state that they were shot in the head by PC Njala as the people were trying to disarm him. This is not true. Actually, when PC Njala and the Police arrived at the scene, they immediately resorted to firing bullets and the two people that were hit by the bullets were boarding a taxi to Ntinda. So, the question to the minister is, since we seemingly have the guts to cover up the unprofessionalism of PC Njala, whose details I have asked for already, can you pass a clear message to all policemen that whenever the bullets they have in their guns get any Ugandan in a disproportional manner, they will be reprimanded and arrested.

Lastly, what has your ministry done to ensure that those who died because of the bullets of PC Njala are given a decent burial – coffins, compensations – since it was not their fault that the bullets got out of the trigger of PC Njala? Please help us with those particulars. I thank you so much. 

3.07
MR JACK WAMANGA-WAMAI (FDC, Mbale Municipality, Mbale): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I also rise to comment on the statement made by the minister. It is usual these days, when you turn on your TV, to see the brutality of policemen. Everyday when you turn on your TV, you will see how policemen are roughing up our people. Is it because the Police is now headed by a military man? Has the training of the policemen changed from the original training of having a helping hand? 

The issue at hand is how policemen are handling my people in Mbale. Elections ended on 18 February of this year but the policemen have kept on arresting and harassing my people at the instigation of a one Jackie Kwaga, who claims to be a daughter of the State House. This lady will just place a call to the State House and the next thing is people are being arrested in Mbale. So, the DPC in Mbale is at the command and whenever there is a small issue or a demonstration coming up, this man is at the forefront roughing up and beating the people. There was a small demonstration by the students of the School of Clinical Officers in Mbale. DPC Opolot was at the forefront, commanding and roughing up these students who had real reasons for the demonstration. 

There was also another peaceful demonstration in Mbale, but the man commanded and beat up the people and the case is being handled by human rights groups. So, please, can you tell the policemen to refrain from harassing the people of Mbale? If Opolot is not refrained, the people may be forced to take the law in their hands, as it is happening everywhere. I thank you, Mr Speaker. 

MR BANYENZAKI: Mr Speaker, arising from the contribution that my colleague has made, you can see that the problem that he actually debated is wider than the statement which the minister has given, and all Members of Parliament here witnessed that there is a problem with how the Police are handling public affairs. The kind of brutality that the honourable member is talking about is even demonstrated everyday on NTV - like the day they brutally handled hon. Nabila Sempala. So, I think we need to debate this issue on a wider scale. I recall that there was a select committee to probe the brutality of the Police; where is it? Mr Speaker, can you guide this House so that perhaps that report can come here and we debate the issue of the way Police is conducting itself in handling public issues so that at least, once and for all, this issue of Police is put to rest. Maybe, the public will get a solution and we as Members could offer guidance to the nation.

THE SPEAKER: I think hon. Members, we should be fair in dealing with this issue because you are now talking only about Police, but as the statement has put it, there is an innocent person who died because of mob justice. I think we should also talk about the mob justice and we should talk about the causes of mob justice so that we look at the two sides of the issue.

3.12
MS BEATRICE ANYWAR (FDC, Woman Representative, Kitgum): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to also thank the minister for his timely statement. If we are all to give testimony on the issue of Police, I do not know which part of the country will have no statement on the inefficiency of the Police.

On the statement itself, the minister has indicated that PC Njala was pushed in an attempt to be disarmed. This is unusual to me that the  minister who is supposed to give us a full disclosure of this - I do not know whether during this time of investigation, the minister was given that information that it was in the process of disarming the Police officer that he shot. And who was there to give that evidence to the minister? Secondly, to disarm a person who is armed is not as easy as we think. People go consciously.

I would like him to be sincere and let this House help his ministry about the mob justice which is becoming clear. Let us get to the root of it. Why is mob justice on the increase? People have lost trust in the Police. Is there laxity in responding by the Police? I think the minister should address this in totality.

I concur with my brother hon. Henry Banyenzaki that whenever you report an incident to Police - I have ever worked under some security arrangement and I was like a focal point of my village to the Police but whenever you ring them that there are thieves or there is a problem, they will ask you, “Are they armed? We do not have transport; can you help us reach there faster?” And these are some of the things you should look at. 

There is a lot of inefficiency but there is a lot of demoralisation of your workforce. They are no longer enthusiastic to respond to problems as they are called upon. There is a double face of the Police now and the Police people used to know. There are those who are well placed; there are  those who are putting on Police uniform when they are not Police officers; and there are those who are more preferred than others. There is no uniformity in your workforce and, therefore, there is no motivation to let your workforce do the work diligently. The very victims who are supposed to be rescued by your Police officers are supposed to facilitate the Police officers. How? It is not forthcoming. 

So, let us go into more detail to help the Police Force do their work; look at the motivation and look at how you rank them. Some are militarily trained; so triggering a gun is not something they can think twice about; while others are originally Police trained. So, the public does not know whether they are dealing with a Police Force trained to handle the public in a policing way or the military to whom killing is not a big issue. I think as much as we talk about this report, we should demand for an investigation into the Police to give us ample opportunity to help this country go into the details of how the Police is being managed; how it is motivated; how it is facilitated; and how it is promoted; rather than sitting here and pretending that we have a Police Force which is so demoralised, de-motivated and mixed up with the military, that it has failed to do its work as expected. 

The sooner that comes, the better for this country rather than having a piecemeal statement which you bring to the House; we talk about it but we never reach the core problem in the Police Force. The Police has a bigger problem. We, Members of Parliament, need to rescue this department, otherwise, they are there to do just work. 

If you do not follow “fwata nyayo”, you are not even supposed to be recognised. I remember after the election, one person said, “Now we shall continue remaining the wives of the Army”. That was a very unfortunate comment. Some are so demoralised that they do not know whether they are in the right place. So, Members, let us encourage the minister to be sincere and get to the root of the problem and save the ministry. Thank you.

3.18
MR LIVINGSTONE OKELLO-OKELLO (UPC, Chua County, Kitgum): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I think the question we should ask is whether we still have a Police Force in the country. Do we have a Police Force in Uganda? 

The word “Police” consists of six letters. Each of these letters has got a meaning. The letter “P” means polite. Are our policemen who are shooting us polite? (Laughter) They should not be part of the Police because they are not polite. The letter “O” is obedient. Are they obedient? They are not and so they should not be part of the force. The “L” is loyal. They should be loyal to the citizens of Uganda, they are not. Are they Police? The letter “I” is intelligent. The minister should tell us whether he has intelligent people in the Police because if you are intelligent, definitely you cannot shoot a civilian who is not armed on the head. “C” is confident. Do they have confidence in themselves -(Laughter)- because if you are confident, you cannot shoot somebody who is not armed? And the last letter “E” is for efficient and you see how efficient they are in shooting us. (Laughter)

My conclusion is that we do not have a Police Force in Uganda. What we see moving around are either civilians or military men in Police uniform. That is what we have. 

Police and the Army are different professions. The Army is trained to shoot to kill because they are supposed to keep the borders to protect us from enemies coming from outside. So they are trained to shoot to kill. But the Police are trained to keep life and property, and to keep law and order.

If you mix the two professions, like we seem to be doing in Uganda, you end up with something else. I wonder whether the minister would consider demilitarising the leadership of Police. I thank you.

3.22
MR DENIS OBUA (NRM, Youth): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me start with an observation and give two questions to the honourable minister. Number one, I think there is something fundamentally wrong with the quality of Police training in Uganda. The quality of Police training in firearms handling seems to be slowly but surely going down. That is why year in and year out, we keep passing constables who are trigger hungry. 

I want to give an example. The Special Police Constables were trained for barely one month and were integrated into the main Police Force. Now they are putting on Police uniforms and they are armed. How do you expect someone trained for one month or two months to be professional in handling a firearm?

Mr Speaker, I come from the North - I know that in firearm handling, the first weapon to apply is the brain. It is the brain that passes information and it is the brain that makes judgement. But when someone is trained for one week and is so much eager to handle an AK47, and all the time he wants to fire; when an opportunity avails itself, definitely fire will be opened. 

The poll constables; these people who were trained for two weeks to handle the general elections, where are they? Some of them were even given Police uniforms after two weeks’ training and somebody is in Police uniform, very flamboyantly moving around as a Police constable. How do you expect him or her to be professional?

Therefore, my question to the minister is - I know that there are three basic international principles of handling a firearm. One is the principle of legality. Immediately you handle a firearm, you should consider its legality. The second one is necessity and the third one is proportionality for force. I want to know whether these three basic principles of handling a firearm are the core of Police training in Uganda. 

The second question is, from the circumstances, your statement to Parliament is clear, but when you go to Ntinda, you would get a different version. I would like to know from your preliminary report whether this man – hon. Members, to shoot somebody on the head is a shot on target and that is shooting to kill. So, if that Police constable was to be given marks on shooting, I think he would get 95 percent on target shooting. So, I would like to know whether this PC was not acting under the influence of alcohol; was he sober? Thank you, Mr Speaker.

3.26
MR BARNABAS TINKASIIMIRE (NRM, Buyaga County, Kibaale): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to ask the honourable minister –  

THE SPEAKER: Well, it should have been hon. Nsubuga, but it is okay, you can go on.

MR TINKASIIMIRE: Mr Speaker, hon. Tinkasiimire Barnabas is very vigilant in representing the people of Buyaga Constituency and I am glad that I have caught the eye of the Speaker. 

Allow me to ask the minister particularly on the area of the qualifications of these Police officers. What type of people are they recruiting for training in the Police? When the Ministry of Education, realising that they were bringing out real garbage from the teacher training colleges, they started attaching certain passes. For example, if you want to go for teaching, at least you must have acquired some minimum passes in senior four. 

So, what kind of people do you recruit to Police; do you have any conditions or you take even those who have got only nines and you expect this garbage in Police to get out with good –(Interjections)– I have evidence, Mr Speaker –(Interruption)

MR BYABAGAMBI: Mr Speaker, we have a code of conduct here stating how we should behave. The Uganda Police is composed of about 36,000 people. At the same time, a Member of Parliament may also have some passes; that is why you must have completed UACE to come here. Is it in order for the honourable Member of Parliament to call other people garbage on the Floor of Parliament? Is that parliamentary language? Is that how we are supposed to conduct ourselves? 

THE SPEAKER: Well, what I can say is that you can make a point or deliver a point home without using bad language; lumping all the people in Police as garbage definitely is not decent language. You may use another term rather than the word “Garbage”. 

MR TINKASIIMIRE: Mr Speaker, I referred to people who got nine –

THE SPEAKER: Even people who have got nine are not garbage.

MR TINKASIIMIRE: And I was referring to their academic qualifications. These could be people undergoing training. We have a concept of computer –(Interruption)

MR DOMBO: Thank you, Mr Speaker and I thank the honourable colleague for giving way. If in the mind of the honourable member, the people who are in the Police who got nine are fit to be called garbage, I want to find out from him, what about Members who are in the House and have got nine, how do we refer to them?
 
MR TINKASIIMIRE: Mr Speaker, he has asked for a very straight clarification - 

THE SPEAKER: No, hon. Member; for somebody to conduct himself properly, he need not have high academic qualifications. Even people who have not gone to school can conduct themselves properly and yet those people with PhDs can misbehave. It is not academic achievement that makes one know what to do in a situation.  

MR TINKASIIMIRE: After your advice, Mr Speaker, I will abandon that argument –(Laughter)- and proceed to my question. My major issue which I will not lose track of is the quality; the qualification; the academic – because if we are emphasising that a Member of Parliament should at least have an equivalent of A’Level as a minimum, there must be some passes. Much as you may have nines; there must be some passes. What type of passes do these Police officers have, particularly the constables? 

In addition to that, in my constituency, during the elections, one woman was celebrating victory after casting her vote for His Excellency, the President of this country, who won the election - unfortunately, this woman was pregnant. This lady was beaten by these hurriedly-trained Police officers and consequently, she lost the baby. This matter was reported to Police but to date, the Police officers who beat up this lady and are known are still at large. I am interested in the honourable minister presiding over this so-called elite Police Force to tell us how far he is going with this matter in my constituency. Thank you very much.

3.34 
MR WILLIAM NSUBUGA (NRM, Buvuma County, Mukono): Thank you very much. 

THE SPEAKER: But hon. Members, as you can see, we have two other ministerial statements we shall have to debate. So, we may have to curtail debate on this so that we hear the other one. 

MR WILLIAM NSUBUGA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the minister for the statement. Paragraph four reads, “On 28 March this year, two people riding a motorcycle were moving from Nateete to Kireka via Ntinda and Nakawa. At Ntinda, they almost caused an accident with a car, an Ipsum.” 

First of all, do the riders have valid driving permits? Because you realise that the speed at which they were riding – after surviving the accident, people thought they were thieves. When you move in Kampala and all towns in Uganda, you realise that 99 percent of the riders do it like they are thieves. I want the minister to tell this House whether these people have permits.

Secondly, the cause of deaths was mob justice from the motorcycle riders.  What are the causes of mob justice? The cause of mob justice is failed institutions. In any state where there is mob justice, there are failed structures. I want to ask the minister at this stage - because when you view the TV stations everyday, there are more than 10 people who lose lives through mob justice. Here, the minister after being reminded, makes two pages and comes to the House to report. I want to assert that even this Parliament which is undermining the Police - because the Police as a whole, especially the CID Department, is underfunded. 

On many occasions, when you get a complaint and go to Police, even if you are an MP, they ask for papers, transport, mention it. That is why the motorcycle riders – for them, they earn Shs 5,000 a day – you cannot afford facilitating the Police when you take your case - that is why they are passing judgment and whenever they suspect anybody, they just kill him. I want the minister to assure this country whether we are going to proceed like that or we are going to address these issues starting with Parliament.

I want to urge Parliament that before we condemn the Police, let the sessional committee responsible for Police examine the budget we give them. This is because it is not only in my constituency, but even in Kampala where all Police stations - I cannot use a rough word, but they are all in an unbelievable state. As we condemn them, even the facilities they use need a lot to be done about them.

As I finalise, let me talk briefly about the training. I want to agree with my colleague that most of the policemen we see have been trained for one or two weeks. I am surprised that on this incidence two policemen, one was armed and the other was not - because of recent, you frequently see 10 to 20 policemen moving as if they are going for a big function –(Interruption)

MS ANYWAR: Thank you, honourable colleague, for giving way. I would like to inform you that much as we are lamenting over the welfare of the Police, the burden is in the hands of the minister to come to this Parliament and bring the budget and justify it the normal way. As Parliament, we have all the goodwill for the Police. 

Secondly, recently, the Police had a sufficient budget to stock the tear gas tankers during the elections, forgetting the welfare of the Police themselves. Thank you.

MR WILLIAM NSUBUGA: As I wind up, thank you for the information. I also want to tell Government that the training of the Police officers, not all but mostly these ones we see on the roads, is still wanting. Instead of training Police officers for one month, they can come here and ask for a supplementary budget and then train enough policemen for this country.

Secondly, I also want to urge Government to make sure that these boda boda riders are trained and they have permits. Because the way they make U-turns, you could think somebody is actually a thief and -(Laughter)

Thirdly, the CID should go a long way in following up people’s cases and see that justice is served. If they do not do this, the issue of mob justice will continue and we shall continue losing life and that will be a very big signal to the state. I thank you.

3.42
MR ALEX NDEEZI (NRM, Persons with Disabilities, Central): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. All I want to appeal for is the need for the Minister and Government to conduct an impartial, independent and comprehensive investigation in as far as mob justice is concerned. This is a nice statement but we all know that he is the minister in charge of the Police and maybe this statement was written or drafted by the police officers: Enkima tesala gwa kibira (A monkey cannot decide the fate of the forest). So, I am saying we need an impartial and independent investigation into the matter of the Police. 

Many friends here and colleagues have made mention of the Police - the conduct of the Police, the behaviour of the Police. I think we should admit that some of our brothers and sisters in the Police are good and committed to the service of this country. Therefore, sometimes I feel it is not fair for us to apportion collective blame on to the entire Police Force. Yes, some members of the Police Force may be bad but it is not all of them.

Second, I would like to say that whether or not the Police exist, you can still have mob justice. Now, think of a situation as that at Ntinda. What could have happened if there were no police officers? So, hon. Members, my appeal is here: the Minister has indicated that mob justice is a problem; it is a scenario that exists. It may exist in Kampala or deep in the village even where the Police do not exist. Therefore, I am thinking that for some time we should focus on mob justice as a problem. The Police would be part of the solution but it is not the entire solution. 

Where does mob justice come from? It means that the traditional and formal justice, law and order sector is corrupting the entire system. The policemen are not the only people who comprise this sector. There are many other people you must look at: the judges, the lawyers, even we MPs. So, that is why, my friends, I am saying and appealing to the Minister: please appoint a commission of inquiry to investigate this scenario of mob justice. Then with this information from the investigation, we as MPs will now help you when it comes to your point No.18. In point No.18 you are asking us MPs to help you with the resolution of the problem of mob justice but where do we start from? Thank you very much. 

3.46
MS ALICE ALASO (FDC, Woman Representative, Soroti): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I want to make some comments on this statement, first of all, by telling the minister responsible for the Police in this country that what we see is a symptom. Like my colleagues, I want to say there is a very big problem with regard to policing in this country. One wonders whether our Police these days do not just know only one thing. And I want to tell this House what the Police know. The Police know strictly how to disperse peaceful demonstrations. Besides that, they do not seem to know that they are obliged to carry out the law and order function in this country in a more civilised way. That is why to me, Mr Speaker, “Two dead, six injured” is not just mere statistics. We are talking about families without the people who earn bread for them, children who will never go to school and widows and so forth.

The real problem is that it looks like my colleague, the minister in charge of this sector, is very powerless when it comes to real decisions that concern this ministry. And I say it with a lot of respect to hon. Matia. He is my friend, but I think that there is a different force that drives policing in Uganda. The political head is not the one who manages policing in this country.

We have information that this policeman who shot and killed people is not a trained policeman and I would like to urge the minister to produce evidence here and lay it on the Table that this man is actually one of those you passed out at one point as a duly and fully trained police officer. 

You know that on the streets of Uganda, there are people who have not finished two months in training. One day I was walking in town and I passed by some policemen and I spoke Ateso - I will translate it for you – saying, “These young people are pretending to be police.” I did not know that one of them was actually from Teso and the boy said, “And auntie I am very hungry. I have been in police training for only one month. They brought us here for elections. If you gave me Shs 3,000 I would be happy.” That is what we have on our streets - people putting on police uniforms, people having guns, people who are not police and I am worried!

Even when you find those who claim to be policemen, the way they treat people whom they have arrested - you see them caning a helpless person inside a police patrol car. The other day during the Lord Mayor’s victory celebrations around Wandegeya, I saw a man who put up his hands before the Police and the so-called policeman ran with a teargas canister and put it in this man’s ear. Those are not police! Hon. Minister, you should have the courage to admit before this House that your institution is infiltrated, it is in disarray and that you are not the one in charge so that you are absolved and we do not have to bash you. Non-police in uniform, kiboko squad in police uniform, crime promoters in police uniform are not preventing any crime; they are just crime promoters putting on our police uniforms!

Mr Speaker, let me raise the alarm on two issues. The first one is that there are so many guns in this country in the hands of wrong people, people who are not supposed to be armed. We have put guns in their hands and I am telling you it is a matter of time before we fail to manage those guns and those various groups we have armed.

The second thing I want to caution Government on is that it looks nice to create a police state but I think it is explosive and very dangerous. When you see all these police in our city what comes to your mind is that they are managing a post-election scenario. In this country, the statistics from the Electoral Commission point to the fact that whether you agree or disagree like I do, 70 percent of Ugandans voted for the NRM Government – for President Museveni. That means seven out of every 10 people you find on the street love President Museveni and the NRM. Do you need all those policemen to police three out of ten people? One of them is Alaso who is not going to go to a demonstration so you are policing only two people.

This is a crisis of legitimacy and we have to be honest about our country; trouble is brewing and if we do not handle this country very well, those people you are giving guns are a recipe for confusion.

Finally, the other alarm that I must raise is this one. In many parts of the country, as we talk now, there are people going around purporting that there are rebel groups being recruited. You go to Teso and they say rebels are being recruited there and when you go to Pader, they are saying the same thing. I do not know what is being said about your part of the country. But all this is being said as a way of managing those people who are opposition supporters. But there are better ways of dealing with the situation; the worst you can have is to try to create a rebel group where there is none. And I think Government will again err if it continues with this notion of intimidation when they know that the people they have armed do not have the capacity even to investigate the matters they have been mandated to do. My prayer to Government is that take back all these crime preventers back to Police training school, train them properly and bring them back. That is my advice to Government because keeping them on the streets is more dangerous and in the long run it will not help. You will come here - can you imagine the minister’s conclusion; it does not have anything about the guys who were shot? 

Instead, he deliberately tries to divert us to mob justice. Mob justice will be there and you are going to see more of it as long as there is a crisis of confidence in the policing. People will always take the law into their hands. But what we want to see is redress; what are you doing about these families? You hear that two people died and six were injured but the minister, in his conclusion, does not even make any recourse to that matter! Thank you.

3.54
MS FRANCA AKELLO (FDC, Woman Representative, Pader): I want to join my colleagues in thanking the minister for following his promise to bring the statement today. A short while ago, before you came in, Mr Speaker, I met him in the lobby of Parliament and whispered something to him –(Interjections)– about the statement and nothing more. You will excuse me, Members. (Laughter) Matters to do with Uganda Police and other forces that are under the ministries of Defence and Internal Affairs, and as a Member who has been on the Committee of Defence and Internal Affairs for three sessions, I take very keen interest in issues to do with policing in Uganda. 

To be honest to ourselves, and with due respect to the hon. Minister, I want to agree with what hon. Alaso has just said. Maybe to add onto what she has said, I want to ask the Minister to be honest and admit that managing the police in Uganda has defeated him over the years he has been allocated this responsibility. (Laughter) Let him admit it because it is normal; I could also be assigned responsibility and once I fail to do it, I can admit and walk away and probably ask to be assigned any other duty in line with what I have expertise in. (Laughter) 

Why do I say this? I have been on the Committee of Defence and Internal Affairs for years and we have been committing ourselves as a committee, telling the minister the right things to do as far as how to handle Police is concerned. But to my surprise, today in 2011, you hear that people are being killed by the same Police. You hear in other parts of the country Police dress in Army uniform and are doing – now we are soiling the name of the Police who underwent the right training and those who are doing their work well. When you watch television news and you see the dirty things that Police do – in most cases I believe they are not Police. I live in the same neighbourhood with a policewoman who is very honest and you would not love to hear all these bad things being said about Police concerning her.

MR SSEKIKUBO: Thank you, hon. Member for yielding the Floor. Mr Speaker, as I followed the hon. Member’s debate, she made a very strong and fundamental point. She said she has been on the Committee of Defence and Internal Affairs for three years and all that she is seeing, in her assessment, is that the minister has terribly failed in his mandate. As I was seated here, I saw only awkward silence without a rebuttal from the minister himself. Does that mean that he has indeed conceded? And if he has conceded, do we have to waste any more time on the minister who has willingly sat back and fallen himself without any rescue from even his colleagues? Are we procedurally right to continue tormenting a minister who has succumbed? Is it worthwhile for us to continue raising issues that are beyond him? Thank you, Mr Speaker. (Laughter)

MS AKELLO: Thank you, hon. Ssekikubo, for that information but I think the minister will have his time to respond to Members’ views. You never know he may finally retire. So, all in all, we do not need to directly blame the Police in general. I want us to look at the higher – in fact, I would not even want to blame Kayihura; I want to blame the person who put Kayihura there. If you see the Police institution being mishandled and we just keep watching, I do not understand what we are going through. 

I want to cite an example – this is the thing I was telling the minister – of the DPC for Agago District, which was recently curved out of Pader. I had worked with the DPC of Pader and we did not have many problems but I have been telling him – and I am going to write to him about the conduct of my DPC – of the new DPC of the district. You can call him on a serious matter, but he will not act; he will just leave the issue there. 

To mention a few of such issues, one of the incidents that hurt me most occurred on 5th March, just two days before we had elections for LC III chairpersons and councillors. On that day we had a terrible incident of people - I didn’t know whether they were soldiers or policemen dressed in army uniforms - who beat up 16 FDC supporters in the evening. And actually beginning with the officer in charge of the police at Kalong town council – I reported this case as a Member of Parliament. I know the law to follow and so I knew that such a case had to be reported to police with the officer in charge taking action and only if he failed then the matter would be reported to the DPC. That is why I made sure the DPC was aware of this. I also appealed to him to take action against those soldiers. I wondered why they would let policemen in army uniforms go to beat up civilians. Or why would anyone send army men to beat up civilians who didn’t have guns?

But I can inform you that from the time I reported this matter to date, nothing has happened. All those 16 FDC supporters – if given time, I will lay the pictures of these poor Ugandans who have been beaten with scars all over their bodies, on the Table. Actually some of them have been terribly – I was meeting the hospital bills at Kalong Hospital, myself because of nothing, but due to the unlawful acts that had been committed against these Ugandans! If such a thing is reported and the police do not take any action, what do you have to do, as a Member of Parliament?

Mr Speaker –(Interruptions)

MR ODONGA OTTO: Mr Speaker, it looks like the lamentations are coming from all over Uganda. Anyway, the information I would like to give to my honourable colleague is: why don’t we persuade the minister to get the policemen out of the barracks so that they can settle in ordinary civilian environment like it happens in Europe where policemen live together with civilians? It will help us to do away with the clout of them coming out to torture the people and they go back to their barracks. This is important because the moment they torture people and they come back to the neighbourhood; they can become the first victims of mob justice. I would like to think that probably that can help the police know what takes place among people. That is the information I had to give.

MS AKELLO: Thank you, hon. Odonga Otto. As I wind up, I would like to say that the minister must take very serious precautions to ensure we see a difference in the way our police conduct themselves by next week. If this doesn’t happen, I would like to suggest that this House takes another action that is within its powers, to put the police to order. This is because you find that after arresting somebody, a policeman keeps torturing him or her. If the person is already arrested, why should you beat or even just manhandle that person? Is that the way policemen are trained in Uganda? Is that what we call keeping law and order?

Mr Speaker, I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity. Otherwise, mob justice will not come to an end in Uganda until people start seeing justice take place. If justice has become unjust, people will definitely keep taking the law into their hands. Yes, we condemn mob justice and any practice that sees civilians going onto the streets of Uganda, but we also want to see our police work. Thank you very much.

THE SPEAKER: No, let us end with him. You will make contributions to the two other statements that we are going to receive today.

4.06
MR EMANUEL DOMBO (NRM, Bunyole County, Butaleja): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. When Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura was appointed the Inspector-General of Police, I am a person who had a lot of misgivings. However, when you look at the visibility of the police today and the equipment they have at their disposal, you would say that there has been a tremendous improvement in the line of visibility and facilitation. Could it be because of the proximity of the person occupying that seat to the historical struggle? I would not want to rule out that possibility.

Also I would like the House to note that Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura is not the first soldier – and not even Lt Gen. Katumba Wamala – to head the police. If you get to the Okello-Okello days, you will discover that Uganda had a soldier inspector general of police, but with the police force behaving not in the way it does today. So, the issue may not necessarily be about the person heading the police, but the conduct and quality of training of the policemen is something we must question as a Parliament of Uganda.

The honourable minister may want to tell us whether our police are drilled on issues of human rights, and their protection. In the police training course content, is there a fully-fledged course on how the police can respect people’s human rights and to know that it is their responsibility to safeguard people including suspects and other people who could be convicted?

The minister’s statement did not tell us what the police are planning to do with the relatives of the innocent people who lost their lives and those who were maimed. Is the police or Government for that matter, going to compensate them? I am saying this because right now these people are bedridden while some of them have died. So, what is going to be done about this violation of their rights? Must they petition the Uganda Human Rights Commission in order to have compensation in regard to the violation of their rights? The minister should tell us what they are doing about the rights of those people no matter whether they are dead or alive because their rights have been violated by the agents of Government in the conduct of their duties.

When you look at the incidents of mob justice – and some people have talked about this – you realise that one issue that is very clear is that when you carefully observe what now is reported by the media, you realise that there are increased incidents of importation of drugs into the country. I would like to find out from the Minister of State for Internal Affairs whether they have conducted any investigations to find out whether there is a match between the levels of crime, the levels of mob justice and the amount of narcotic drugs that are being imported into the country? If so, what is it that the minister is doing about it?

What surprises me is that each time the police arrest somebody at the airport doing drug trafficking, they complain to the media that our laws are inadequate and so leave a lot to be desired. They have also said that such laws are making Uganda a good hub for drug trafficking.
 
In that regard, could the minister also tell us why the revision of these laws has taken this long even after the policemen continue crying to the public through the media? What is the problem with it?

Mr Speaker, you will recall that sometime back, I moved a motion about the conduct of the police especially in regard to the way they had handled some of the honourable members of Parliament. In line with that, a select committee was set up but the last time we heard about it was when they went to State House to get the input of H.E the President. And at one time actually, it was shown as business to follow on the Order Paper. Unfortunately, this has not materialised yet. But that could be because of the busy schedules that we have been going through? Anyway, may I find out from the concerned Members when this report will be coming up? I am saying that because some of the issues that we are talking about now could have been effectively dealt with by that committee.

Then finally –(Interruption)

MR OKUPA: Thank you, Mr Speaker and hon. Dombo. Hon. Dombo, it is not only about the issue of hon. Nabilah. There were more things that the committee was supposed to cover, which hon. Peter Nyombi, who is now busy bashing the Speaker, has failed to produce in this House. He was a chair of that committee. He has failed to do that for two to three years now. 

The other issue that was before the committee was the probe report regarding recruitment. I have a list here of the recently recruited cadets. Nothing has changed! You cannot imagine that a district like Kiruhura has again had the biggest share in recruitment – 23! You go to Abim 1; Lira 4; Isingiro 10; Serere 0; Kayunga 2; Ntungamo 19; Kanungu 12; Rukungiri 15; the whole of Teso, which has eight districts, has only 20 and yet Kiruhura has 23. So, the issue of recruitment has still continued to be the same and yet this is what the committee was supposed to look into. That committee has failed this country. 

Mr Speaker, may I lay this list on the Table? This is the list of cadets that were recruited at the end of last year. You know very well that in our Constitution, recruitment is supposed to be regionally balanced. This was the reason that a select committee was put to this task, which hon. Peter Nyombi has failed to deliver. 

We are very disappointed that the same thing has happened again. Here is the list for the cadet officers that were recruited in 2010/11. If I am allowed, I can  read the number of cadets recruited per district, and then I lay it on the Table: 

Abim District 2; Adjumani 2; Agago 4; Alebtong 1; Amolatar 2; Amuria 1; Amuru 2; Apac 1; Arua 5; Budaka 2; Bududa 2; Bugiri 1; Buikwe 1; Bukedea 2; Bukwo 1; Busia 1; Bundibugyo 3; Bushenyi 15; Busia 4; Butaleja 4; Butambala 1; Buyende 2; Dokolo 4; Gomba 1; Gulu 7; Hoima 12; Ibanda 7; Iganga 10; Isingiro 10; Jinja 9; Kibuku 2; Kabale 8; Kabarole 5; Kaberamaido 3; Kaliro 5; Kampala 8; Kamuli 9; Kamwenge 4.

Kanungu 12; Kapchorwa 9; Kasese 6; Katakwi 3; Kayunga 3; Kibale 4; Kiruhura 23; Kisoro 20; Kitgum 2; Koboko 2; Kole 1; Kumi 3; Kween 1; Kyegegwa 2; Kyenjojo 4; Lamwo 2; Lira 4; Luuka 2; Luweero 1; Lwengo 6; Lyantonde 3; Manafwa 1; Maracha 2; Masaka 4; Masindi 4; Mayuge 3; Mbale 10; Mitooma, 9; Mityana, 1; Mukono, 6; Moroto 1; Moyo 2; Mpigi 1.

Mubende 1; Nakaseke 6; Nakasongola 3; Namayingo 1; Namutumba 1; Nebbi 3; Ngora 1; Ntoroko 2; Ntungamo 19; Nwoya 1; Oyam 4; Pader 1; Pallisa 2; Rakai 5; Rukungiri 15; Sembabule 1; Sheema 8; Soroti 5; Sironko 4; Tororo 3; Wakiso 4; Yumbe 2; Zombo 4; Serere 0.

It is very disappointing. The other districts don’t have - if you have not heard your district – but if the committee had produced the report this is what they should have addressed. So, can the Minister of Internal Affairs, once more, tell us why other regions have been marginalised to this level, and in total violation of the Constitution? 

I lay this on the Table. Thank you.    

MR DOMBO: The minister will have to respond to that. 

Finally, Mr Speaker, there is a lot of security work that is being undertaken by private security guards. And there is a very big public-private partnership between the police and security guards in observing and enforcing security in the countryside. 

I want to find out from the honourable minister how this section is supervised, in training and supervision, and whether we have a person at commissioner or whatever level who is responsible for supervision of recruitment and the quality of training because there have been many incidents, which have not been reported, where private guards have maimed people, without necessarily being compensated, and yet they are doing this as agents of Government. I thank you very much. 

THE SPEAKER: Do you have anything to say? Let’s close this; we have three other statements.

4.18
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr Matia Kasaija): Mr Speaker, I will first respond to my brother, hon. Ssekikubo. I am schooled to behave and to respect authority. I allow people to say what they want to say and I respond. So, I don’t know whether hon. Ssekikubo wanted me to behave like he normally behaves in Sembabule, by disrespecting authority - by me coming up to say that what one is saying is not right. I want to assure you, hon. Members that the police have performed. If you imagine where we came from and where we are today –(Interjection)- colleagues, on this one I won’t budge because I can come back to this House and bring you facts and figures. If you know where we came from and where we are today, I really feel pain that we do not give police the due credit for they have been able to achieve a lot despite – and I am not saying that we have reached there but we have reached somewhere and we think police deserve that credit despite these shortcomings, which I know too well. 

Mr Speaker, give me all the money that I need. I have come to this House many times, I have gone to the committee many times; they have been giving us only a-third of what we ask for -(Interjections)- I thought we had little time –

THE SPEAKER: What is the point of procedure? 

MS ANYWAR: Thank you, Mr Speaker. As an institution of Parliament, we have been very supportive of the Police Force. I have just stood here as one of my colleagues has also said requesting the minister to come and bring all that is needed to make Uganda Police Force an acceptable one. Could it be procedurally right for the Minister, instead of answering the questions and probably later on preparing a report to this House, to continue commenting and even wishing away the good will of this Parliament to support his ministry by saying that we should come up and give him the money that he has presented and which we have never given him? Is it procedurally right for the Minister to address a different issue rather than the one raised by colleagues while trying to blindfold what is being addressed right now?

THE SPEAKER: I thought the Minister is answering the queries that you have raised and he is saying he is lacking money. Give him money and he will improve.

MR KASAIJA: Mr Speaker, I thank you very much for that wise ruling. Regarding the reference number of the cases that hon. Okello asked, we have them and we shall provide them.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, let us end this and proceed with other business. Let us get the other equally important statements.

MR BANYENZAKI: Mr Speaker, the point of order I am raising is: is it in order for the minister to blackmail this Parliament that it has not given money to Police when actually he himself, when he brings the budget for Police - for example, the other day they brought a supplementary budget for Police and he brought one for tear gas, Mambas and those kinds of things? 

He has not brought funding for the welfare of the Police and he is here blackmailing Parliament when actually it should have even been from the Executive. Is it in order for the Minister to blackmail the Parliament that we Members of Parliament are not pro people or pro Police? Is he in order?

THE SPEAKER: I think you have read a certain novel where somebody says, “Give me more.” I think this is what he is saying.

MR KASAIJA: Mr Speaker, I thank you very much.

THE SPEAKER: Please, wind up; we have spent one and a half hours on this statement.

MR KASAIJA: Mr Speaker, I will try to be short but I have got about 30 queries that were raised by my colleagues. Let me see how best I can be able to answer them very briefly. 

Reprimanding the trigger happy Police. The law is very clear; you misbehave and go according to the law. As we speak that officer, as I have quoted in the statement, is behind bars.

Compensating the families of the deceased and the injured ones - that one is seriously being studied and at an appropriate time, Government is definitely going to do something positive. I cannot commit myself at this material time because we are studying the extent and amount but definitely Government will be able to do something.

Police brutality because Police is led by a military officer - we are not the only country - first of all I want to thank Ndugu Dombo who has said Kale Kayihura is not the first military man to lead the Uganda Police neither is it the NRM that has had the first military man leading our Police. Tanzania Chief of Police is a military man. In Kenya, the former police boss was a military man. In Rwanda, the police chief is a military man. So really it is not the first time this has happened and we are not an exception in the region.

Brutality: I have stood before this Parliament on many occasions and I have said the law - I agree some of our police officers get excited at times and they do things, which they should not do but I want to remind you that Police will handle you in the manner in which you present yourself. We shall use what is called “reasonable force” and as you know, this can be interpreted differently by different officers. So really the way we handle suspects also depends on how the suspects themselves present themselves. If they prove to be brutal – surely, as I said, if you put up your hands and you accept that you can be arrested, I can tell you most police officers will never touch you at all. I have said “most” please mark my words very well.

The conduct of our Police in Mbale: we have got a unit, which is mandated to make sure that police officers behave in accordance with the law - the PSU. So now that I have received that information on Mbale, I can assure this House that we shall investigate, send our officer there and if that officer is not behaving in accordance with the police norms, action will be taken as it has been taken in some other places.

Non uniformity within the Police: I do not understand this question whether it is in terms of treatment or recruitment. Unfortunately, I am unable to comment on this one.

Police are demoralised: we are doing everything possible as police managers, to make the Police job very comfortable in as much as our resources can be able to allow us. 

Do we have a Police in Uganda? Honourable who I prefer to call OO, do we have a Police in Uganda? The answer is yes, we do have a Police in Uganda. It may be an imperfect Police but we have a Police in Uganda. As I have said before, if, just for two hours, we had to withdraw all the Police from Kampala and take them somewhere, I don’t know whether Members would feel comfortable walking on the streets of Kampala. Are you authorising me that tomorrow we withdraw the Police from the city? I don’t think that would be wise anyway but I don’t think we shall like it.

Police efficiency, yes, I admit certain things are not being efficiently done but as I said from the beginning, it is the question of where we have come from and where we are now.

Police is not militarised. The Police, which we are trying to shape and evolve, really must be trained in accordance with the situation to which it has to be trained. You know very well we have come out of a war situation in this country. One colleague here actually said there are a lot of guns in wrong hands so if the Police were not trained to handle even situations where they can be faced with a military situation, how would they do it?

In the past we have been handling the question of cattle rustling between the Karimojong and the neighbouring districts. Would you want to tell me that that type of Police that I would train is the Police that simply pat the back of a rustler? He must be given the confidence and tools to handle the situation as it comes. 

Can I make one point clear; I would like you to distinguish between the SPCs that were policing the elections and the election constables. Those constables that sat within the polling stations were not supposed to be armed. The ones who were supposed to be armed are the SPCs who had to patrol in case somebody brought a problem. Instructions were very firm and clear that the election constables should not be armed at all. 

Recruitment is at various levels. In the Police, there are the managers like the cadets we recruit for management and then there are police constables, police personnel. The police at the lower level are recruited, and I repeat, are recruited with the recommendation of the LC people- your leaders in the villages. We will not take on any person as a police constable until we have received a letter of commendation from the LC. 

Garbage: My brother, Barnabas, I would really ask you to withdraw this word. Mr Speaker, I would really humbly ask my brother Barnabas to withdraw. It is not garbage that we bring in the Police. There may be wrong elements like in any other institutions but we are not garbage in the Police. 

The pregnant lady that was allegedly beaten by the Police: we received those details and all investigations are being done. The culprits will be handled in accordance with the law. 

Do all riders have driving permits? Well, the answer I will give to that question is that the Police are not the ones that issue driving permits. Our job is to ensure that you have the driving permit but we do not issue it. 

Hon. Ndezi was suggesting that we put up a commission of inquiry to look into this question of justice. I think this is a good idea. I will go back to the ministry and share it with other colleagues and stakeholders and see how it can be done. 

This leads me to the second point; the law and order sector is not composed by Police. We have many arms as you know very well, colleagues, so I do not need to labour on this point. 

Someone suggested that I have failed to manage the Police and therefore I should resign. I am very categorical that I am not going to resign because I feel that we have been doing a wonderful job. (Laughter) 

We have been given an ultimatum that they must behave in a given manner within a specified period. I do not think that ultimatum is realistic. All I want to do is assure this House that we are going to do everything within our powers to ensure that the Police behave in a manner that befits them and that you will feel proud of having a Police force of that type. 

Human rights course: yes absolutely, hon. Dombo, it forms a very big percentage of the training in Kabalye especially for cadets. It handles issues of handling people humanely, respecting their human rights and conducting themselves in a civil manner. 

Investigations about the usage of narcotics and drugs; yes, we are aware. This is going on. As for the law, I have just been informed that the law on narcotics is before this Parliament and it is up to Parliament to bring it up on the Order Paper and we proceed with it so that we can dispose of it as quickly as possible.  Mr Speaker, I pray that this can be done before this Parliament is prorogued. 

The private security guards; there is a whole department right now headed by a commissioner who looks after this sector of the private security guards. We have laid out regulations and laws and also conditions that we normally insist on before anybody can be registered as a private security guard business proprietor. 

Recruitment of cadets will be my last point. This matter has resurfaced. You remember, honourable members, I was tasked before this House about two to three years ago and I brought all the application forms which I laid before the House here. However, I will come back on this question to bring you exactly how the recruitment took place.

May I mention one thing before I sit down- (Ms Alaso rose_) – No, may I finish one thing before you come in, hon. Alaso, and then you can raise your supplementary if the Speaker allows you. We cannot force people to join the Police - (Interjections)- Mr Speaker, can I be protected? 

THE SPEAKER: I would suggest for this one that you make a separate statement because you did not look at it. I would think that the intention of hon. Okupa was to indicate that some districts had 15, others 12, others 19 and others had only one. This is something that you may not be able to deal with at this juncture because the document has just been laid on the Table. It is better you go and study it and then you will be in a position to answer. If you venture into explaining it now, it may cause you a problem. I would suggest that you get a copy and study it and then be able to respond satisfactorily. 

MR KASAIJA: Most obliged, Mr Speaker. I will take your wise counsel. As I said, I will come back before this House with a full statement to explain precisely what took place. Thank you very much, honourable colleagues. 

MS ALASO: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. He has not mentioned the day he will back. 

There is additional information, which I would implore the minister to come along with, which is also very critical, and that is the career opportunities in the Police Force. We have information that just like the recruitment, other regions do not benefit a lot from career opportunities in the Police Force including deployments to serve in those juicy opportunities under the UN. Other regions are treated the way they are treated during recruitment.  

We would appreciate if we got information to do with the current UN deployments that the Uganda Police are serving in; and then who is on state scholarship under career development in the Police Force; who is on study leave and the course they are pursuing plus the village of their origin especially if you do not come from Serere. I am really interested in this. 

THE SPEAKER: Okay, thank you very much. Is it possible to give us the date that you are going to comment on this other statement? 

MR KASAIJA: Mr Speaker and hon. Members, may I seek your indulgence so that you allow me two weeks’ grace and then I come back before this House.   

THE SPEAKER: Okay, two weeks from now.   

MINISTERIAL STATEMENT

4.41
THE MINISTER OF ENERGY AND MINERAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr Hilary Onek): My papers are being circulated. Mr Speaker and honourable members, you will recall that in December 2010, I tabled to this august House the production sharing agreements Government had entered into with the international oil companies for exploration, development and production of petroleum in this country. During the presentation, I informed the House about the then ongoing sales by Heritage Oil and Gas Limited of all its interests in the country to Tullow Oil and the requirements for Tullow Oil to farm down part of its assets in the country so as to avoid monopoly situations in the country’s oil and gas sector. I am glad to inform the House that Government has now consented to the conclusion of the commercial and business transactions related to these sales. 

Mr Speaker, the sales which Government has consented to are:
i) 	Tullow Oil’s acquisition of the entire interest which Heritage Oil and Gas Limited had in exploration areas 1 and 3A of the Albertine Graben. Heritage Oil and Gas Limited had a 50 percent share in each of these two exploration areas.

ii) 	Tullow Oil’s sales of 66.6 percent of its interests in exploration areas 1, 2 and 3A to Total and CNOOC respectively after acquisition of Heritage Oil and Gas Limited interests. Total and CNOOC are acquiring 33.3 percent each of the interest being sold by Tullow Oil.

The result of these sales is that Tullow Oil, Total and CNOOC will be joint partners in the three exploration areas 1, 2 and 3A and they will each have 33.3 percent shares in each of these three areas. Exploration areas 4B and 5 remain licensed to Dominion Petroleum and Neptune Petroleum as sole licensees respectively.

The key considerations for Government’s approval of the new entrants in the sector through these sales have included:
i) 	The capitalisation and investment capacity of the companies.
ii) 	The technical capacity.
iii) 	Experience of these companies in operating oil and gas activities; and
iv) 	Alignment with Government’s development strategy of the early commercialisation of the discovered petroleum resources through the establishment of a refinery in the country. 

Completion of these sales has enabled the country to attract more companies in the oil and gas sector. The companies coming in the sector as a result of these transactions are also stronger both financially and technically. These companies are therefore much more able to support the country to achieve its desired objectives of developing the entire value chain of the oil and gas sector, that is, from exploration and production through refining and gas processing to marketing and sales. 

Mr Speaker, these transactions are also going to attract capital gains tax for the country. The country expects to receive up to US$ 430 million on the first transaction of Tullow Oil’s acquisition of Heritage Oil and Gas Limited’s assets and up to US$ 475 million on the second transaction of Total and CNOOC’s acquisition of part of Tullow Oil’s assets as presented above. The Uganda Revenue Authority and the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development are taking forward the tax aspects of these sales. 

I wish to inform the House that these sales, mergers or acquisitions as they are sometimes called are normal and common practice in the oil and gas industry as indeed they are in other sectors. In 2009, for example, there were 167 such transactions in the oil and gas sector worldwide, attracting a total value of US$ 90 billion. Eighty of these transactions were in North America while 14 were in Africa. Uganda is therefore likely to see more of these sales in the sector as the industry continues to develop in the country. 

I wish to emphasise that these sales are not sales of the oil and gas resources which have been discovered in the country but they are sales of these companies’ interests in the licences they have in this country. The oil and gas resources are still in the country and are governed by the laws of Uganda – (Interjections) – if you could be patient, my colleagues. Listen first before you open your mouth – (Interjections) – I apologise for that. 

In addition, the cost of these acquisitions will not be paid back as recoverable costs when the production of oil starts. In other words, the transactions between these companies are just issues of their interest. It is not going to be reflected in the cost of oil when we start pumping oil. Those are just company values buying themselves in their values. 

These are entry costs which are not recoverable. The costs which are to be recovered are only those which the companies are spending on the actual work. What they spend on drilling and extracting the oil and other activities related to exploration and production are the costs that will be considered when dealing with the oil products. These recoverable costs will also be audited by the Auditor-General and agreed before being recovered. 

Following conclusion of the sales, we now expect to see expedited appraisal and development of the oil fields which have already been discovered together with continued exploration in the areas where no discoveries have been made yet. 

This has been a brief presentation on these sales as the ministry prepares a more detailed presentation, which will be made to the natural resources committee of this august House. Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much.

MR HENRY BANYENZAKI (NRM, Rubanda County West, Kabale): Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the minister for promptly bringing this information although he had to wait for us to trigger him. 

The issue at hand is the Petroleum Resources Management Act – if it becomes an Act, anyway. The problem in this sector is that much as the minister has come out with this information, there is no transparency in this sector. In his opening statement, the minister says he laid the production sharing agreements on the Table and I remember when he did that, he said that they should not be given to members without regulation. For that matter, I have written letters twice to the Office of the Clerk requesting to see and peruse through those production sharing agreements but I have been denied an opportunity.

As Parliament, we cannot competently debate this statement of the minister without seeing those productions sharing agreements. Why are you keeping this information a secret? If you did a good deed for Uganda or Ugandans, why do you keep these kinds of deals a secret? Why don’t you show them to especially Members of Parliament? 

The other day I was sharing the information with hon. Katuntu. When he wanted to see these production sharing agreements, he was made to sit in the Office of the Clerk and told to read them from there. Was that information brought to Members of Parliament? I request the minister and the government to be transparent in this sector and more so, to adopt the transparency initiatives which the minister undertook.

About the taxes, much as the minister is saying that we are going to benefit from this capital gains tax, the legal framework under which we are collecting this tax is very unclear. The other day we were hurriedly made to pass the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill by a committee of Parliament and the Bill we were passing was also based on the production sharing agreements. When the committee asked for those agreements, it was denied access to those agreements. What is it that you are hiding?

There are many more memoranda of understanding which the ministry has made with these companies. I can see in his statement, under No.9, he says that the cost of these acquisitions will not be paid back as recoverable costs when production of oil starts. When you read this statement, it ends thus, “These recoverable costs will also be audited by the Auditor-General and agreed before being recovered”. All these issues are within the production sharing agreements and the way these production sharing agreements have been made, these companies are going to first recover costs of their investments before Ugandans or Uganda gets some benefits out of the whole business. 

We need to be very careful even when the minister says that they will be audited by the Auditor-General. Where is the law backing the Auditor-General to audit the books of accounts of private companies? How will the Auditor-General go and audit the books of Tullow Oil, CNOCC or Total for that matter? There is no legal framework. 

I implore Parliament to take interest in this matter of the oil and gas sector and to take interest in this policy. These Bills which are before Cabinet are very urgent Bills that this Parliament should have passed before we finish this term. If we had done that, it would have been a package to Ugandans.

Mr Speaker, I thank you very much and I thank the honourable minister for coming with this information. On the other hand, because of this non-transparency and because getting information was so difficult, a group of Members of Parliament formed a Parliamentary Forum on Oil and Gas where I am privileged to serve as chairman. I implore the Members of Parliament to join me, to join this forum and through this forum we shall squeeze information from the honourable minister although he says that before we open our mouths, we should first listen. I thank you.

MS ANYWAR BEATRICE: Thank you, Mr Speaker. The issue we are debating today about oil is about life and death of this country. We are talking about the future of this country as I heard the submission from my honourable colleague, Henry Banyenzaki, responding to my honourable brother, Hillary Onek’s submission. This is work that the minister has brought but as a country and as peoples’ representatives, we need to know all the details, stage by stage, on how we are going to manage this high expectation and high relief to poverty of this country.

You are quite aware that as an institution of Parliament, we members have not got all the details of the production sharing agreements that the minister laid here so that we understand how the wealth we have is going to be managed. We need full details on how the production is going to be managed and how the revenue accruing from this production is going to be managed. As my brother says, we need a legal framework to make it work.

THE SPEAKER: No, you wanted guidance and now you are making a submission. It is really clear in the last paragraph of this statement - hopefully this is what the minister intends to do – that he is giving a detailed statement to a committee of this Parliament, the Committee on Natural Resources. When he presents that detailed statement, all these questions will come. He admitted that this was a brief statement but he has undertaken to make a presentation to our committee in charge of the sector.

MS ANYWAR: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was actually seeking guidance on that premise. As the minister himself admits, at an appropriate time he will bring more details; would it therefore have been prudent for us as Parliament to debate this statement in isolation of the remaining information which is very critical to enable us as Members of Parliament embrace the procedure of how the wealth of this country is going to be managed? It is very important that we have it in full.

THE SPEAKER: This statement, I think, has been made to inform us that Heritage sold its shares to Tullow and having taken Heritage shares, Tullow has brought in other shareholders. This was to tell us the position of shareholding this company is going to be engaged in. That is why it is as brief as that. Other details are going to come in the statement which he has undertaken to give to our committee. I think we should ask our committee to be vigilant and follow up this undertaking which the minister has given.

4.57
MR STEPHEN MUKITALE (NRM, Buliisa County, Masindi): Thank you so much, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the minister for responding to members’ concerns about what was in the media on transactions between the different oil companies without Parliament having enough information.

Honourable minister, you did pledge early last year that the ministry is working on a communication strategy and that Parliament will regularly be informed. I would like to request, if it is possible, that we make it bi-annual because this is an evolving sector. It is a new sector so I would like to suggest, if it is agreeable, that it is adopted here in the House that we agree on regular quarterly or bi-annual progress reports - that was both in the Committee of Natural Resources and in the meeting we had in Entebbe. That would help us solve this problem. 

Secondly, whereas I would be very eager to have the Bills debated by this Parliament, I know that the time limit now renders us incompetent to do that. So I would like to know from the minister whether it is possible to lay the Bills on the Table. This is because the Bills are so critical and this process needs to be very consultative, so it will take a lot of time. I know the Eighth Parliament cannot handle it, but just having the Bills in place can mark the beginning of the process. 

Managing anxiety in this sector is very important. Let the people know your intentions, the spirit and principles within the Bill. That would allay the fears in the civil society and the different stakeholders. So hon. Minister, is it possible for the Eighth Parliament to get the Bill? If not, at least the principles, so that the public out there can get to know how much Parliament and Government are taking care of this sector. 

We were also informed that Government engaged a very important feasibility study; what are the findings? To date, Parliament does not know them. The reason why the big companies are coming in is because they have sniffed into the feasibility study. They know the economic feasibility of our oil but we, the representatives of the people, have not been given the privilege of knowing the findings of this feasibility study. 

Talking about the recoverable costs; hon. Minister, I do not know whether it will wait again for the committee briefing you will give. Our production sharing agreements are of a profit nature. The cost of production, which is being expended now by the company, will have to be removed before Ugandans get any money. If Parliament is not privy to the cost of exploration in detail, then there is a problem. 

I would request that at an appropriate time, before the Eighth Parliament closes and we go to the Ninth Parliament, we are given this information so that Ugandans get to know the cost of this prospect. This is because whatever we will get as Uganda will come from the profit. So I thought it is important for us to know and it is in your interest, hon. Minister of Energy and the other ministries which are coming on board in this industry like Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Lands and Ministry of Works, to be giving this Parliament the feel of the budget requirements even in this budget process that we are starting. 

What is it that is required in this new sector so that Members of Parliament do not discuss this budget without knowing the financial implications and the pressures that are coming in? I know there is a lot of progress made, but because of lack of a communication strategy and failure to give us what came out of the feasibility study and what should come first and – 

THE SPEAKER: I think you are now repeating yourself.

MR MUKITALE: Okay; I would like to see this critical information given to Parliament so that the media and the civil society do not exploit the information gap to give a wrong picture to the country. 

5.06
MR THEODORE SSEKIKUBO (NRM, Lwemiyaga County, Ssembabule): Thank you, Mr Speaker. The importance of this question and the statement is that the whole amount of the transaction, US$2.9bn, once translated is more than our entire national budget. So by one transaction only, a company has been able to take off more than the Uganda national budget. It is covered under one transaction. So, whereas we may look at the peanuts of CHOGM and so on, the crux of the matter is here. By one transaction, US$2.9bn has changed hands. 

Mr Speaker, I find this statement not sincere in point 9 - “These are entry costs which are not recoverable…” Hon. Minister and members, there is no charity in oil business. The minister should not take this Parliament for granted. These are costs which have to be recovered. Before you can start counting any gains or revenues from your oil, this is the amount of money which has to be taken off. So, this transaction was done and this is an important sector for which we must demand immediate answers. 

It is true this money has already been spent or it has already changed hands, and we the owners of the resources are still looking on. 

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Ssekikubo, I thought the gist of this statement would be seen in paragraph 6 where it says that there was a transaction were other companies have now replaced Heritage. As a result of this transaction coming in to take shares or 33.3 percent, there is a tax that is going to be recovered from this transaction and the total tax recovered is US$ 900million. 

MR SSEKIKUBO: But you see, Mr Speaker, these ministers are going to lead you to a point where you cannot even allow us an opportunity. I was coming to that very point, Mr Speaker, which you are attempting to pre-empt. On the so-called US$ 430 million I want you to be ashamed here and now; the matter was taken to the arbitration court in London. Even this which is put here is not ours to comment about. We are at point zero, hon. Minister and members. Heritage disagreed on this tax and Tullow, a UK company, chose to have this matter arbitrated in the UK. 

So, to me, before you even go to the second transaction, this first transaction should have been put out of the way so that we can know how much we got out of the first transaction between Heritage and Tullow – (Interruption)

MS NANKABIRWA: Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I would like to thank hon. Ssekikubo for giving way. I want to inform hon. Ssekikubo and also allay his fears that the money he is talking about will form 9.2 percent of our next budget. This money is not spent as he is alleging; we have budgeted for it and it will form 9.2 percent of our budget. Thank you. 

MS ALASO: Thank you very much, hon. Ssekikubo. I want clarification from the hon. Minister of Finance. Previously, we were told from countries which manage oil resources that it is very dangerous to pick oil revenues and immediately inject them into funding the budget. There has to be a legal framework which defines first of all a collection account where we are going to put this money. Now the minister is telling us that if this money comes, she has already budgeted for it; doesn’t this raise issues of macro-economic stability which the Movement Government always talks about? That is one.

Two, how do we deal with matters of transparency on oil revenue? If you are going to sit with Tullow, work out the capital gains and incomes and then all of a sudden you are appropriating that money, how do we deal with matters of transparency? It takes us back to what my colleague said in the House, that we need to have a legal framework first so that we manage the oil revenue. 

MR SSEKIKUBO: Mr Speaker, with a lot of pain I must tell the entire House that what is put here on paper, US$ 430 million, is under arbitration. The minister cannot deny this. I tell you, honourable members, we are bound to lose this case. 

MR ONEK: Thank you very much, Mr Ssekikubo, for giving me the Floor. I want to clarify as follows. 

The first transaction of Heritage selling its interest to Tullow was for a consideration of US$ 1.5 billion. That US$ 1.5 billion was paid by Tullow and Government charged 30 per cent tax on that transaction. By first removing US$ 150 million from it, the one which Heritage injected in drilling wells and started developing the oil fields, the balance of US$ 1.35 billion was taxed at 30 per cent which came to US$ 405 million tax –(Interjections)- Can you listen to the end, please?  Now you are jumping before I finish? How will you know?   

That tax of US$ 405 million was disputed by Heritage and Tullow but Tullow had already been given a notice by the Uganda Revenue Authority that they should pay from source and not give Heritage all the money. What happened is that by our tax laws, Tullow is to pay this tax. Tullow has agreed to pay and claim their money from Heritage. That is what is happening. 

In the memorandum of understanding we signed with Tullow here in Uganda, there is no going to London. I told you this sometime back when the argument on tax was taking place. I said the oil is in Uganda, there is no going to London. We have to have it – (Interjections) - Please be patient. Listen up to the end.  

Now, the tax matter will be resolved in our courts. If they are complaining that the tax is not right, there is a tax tribunal with Uganda Revenue Authority and they are going to launch that.  (Ms Anywar rose_) If you know more, why do you disturb me?  I do not have to hear – (Laughter) - Why do you disturb me? I am going to explain –

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, on this issue, you should have started by seeking information from the minister instead of relying on newspaper reports. You should have asked the minister if it is true that what you have told us is a subject of arbitration in UK. The minister would then have told you, it is not.  The newspapers cannot be the source of information. Check the information and then after getting his reaction, bring your evidence. 

MS ALASO: Your guidance is appreciated but the real problem we have here is that the people who should be giving us information are not giving us information. If you create a vacuum, something is going to fill it and the press is filling it for the Government of Uganda. We will believe what the press gives us until the minister gives us the right information and –

THE SPEAKER: Now, is he going to deny what he has told us? Hon. Member, is the minister going to deny having come here and it is on record? He has said this is not a subject of arbitration; don’t you agree that this is the right information? 

MR ONEK: Mr Speaker, I fully agree that there has been a communication gap because somewhere there is a weakness. I agree there has been a communication gap and I would like you – (Interjections)

THE SPEAKER: Now, what order? He is explaining. Give him time to explain.

MR ONEK: Why are we not sensible?  

THE SPEAKER: Give him time to explain. Let him explain and then you contradict him later. Let him say what he has to say. If you think it is not the truth, tell us.  Let him finish what he wants to say. 

MR ONEK: Mr Speaker, while acknowledging that there has been a gap between Parliament and my ministry, I want to state clearly that in the production sharing agreement, originally the arbitration –

THE SPEAKER: Order! Let us listen to the minister please.  

MR ONEK: The arbitration was supposed to be done in London but we objected to that and we reconstituted fresh negotiations with these oil companies. We put our feet down and we insisted that all must be done in Uganda and nowhere else. There is a MoU and these are part of the documents we are going to submit to the Committee on Natural Resources. When I say that we are going to submit to the Committee on Natural Resources, more detailed information that was part of the information will be brought. The reason I could not bring it here is because Parliament only asked to know about the transaction of Tullow, CNOOC and Heritage; nothing more.

MS ANYWAR: Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is very unfortunate that my honourable brother, the minister, is not telling the whole truth. In the production sharing agreement which the minister laid on the Table of Parliament, there is a clause in that agreement that says that arbitration about matters of this nature is going to be in London. That was one of the issues which were under contention. Is the honourable minister in order to come and lie to this Parliament that they are in negotiations while the document which he laid does not allude to that?  Is he in order? 

THE SPEAKER: That is not the term you use. There is a sophisticated way of saying so. (Laughter)  The Hon. Member has said she knows the paragraph in the agreement which says that the arbitration – Have you changed it or it is still the same position? 

MR ONEK: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am very happy that hon. Beatrice Anywar has read the production sharing agreement in detail to the extent of knowing which paragraphs are talking about arbitration. I am happy because all along they have been saying that this is a confidential document, it is secret, we have been hiding –(Laughter)- so, I am glad she has got the right. 

That notwithstanding, I want to state clearly that we have re-negotiated those aspects of the production sharing agreement which gave London authority over our oil. London no longer has authority over our oil. Everything will be negotiated here and I told you before. They tried to approach me through the windows, through what, I stood my ground and I am still standing my ground. We have everything in Uganda; even arbitration will be here. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Now, honourable minister, is it the position that the agreement was reviewed?

MR ONEK: Mr Speaker, the original Production Sharing Agreement which hon. Beatrice Anywar read in detail specified those positions she has mentioned, but we had had a discussion with this oil company. We reviewed those positions which were originally in the Production Sharing Agreement and we entered into a new memorandum of understanding which altered the contract. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Is it possible for you to avail Members the revised version of the agreement?

MR ONEK: Yes. I stated earlier that we are going to give a comprehensive report to the committee and that document -[THE SPEAKER: “You send me a copy”]- we shall avail you copies. Thank you. 

THE SPEAKER: Okay.

5.23
MR THEODORE SSEKIKUBO (NRM, Lwemiyaga County, Ssembabule): Mr Speaker, this is really a problem when one attempts to mislead the House. The agreements that were tabled are specific on London. We are bashing the newspapers, but it is our own fault; and when we blame the papers I do not get the logic.

Mr Speaker, what I am trying to say is that, as we stand now, the matters are before arbitration and if there was any MoU, we should have had an addendum and he should have tabled it in this House. But since we are not party to what he is alleging, it is still gossip and you cannot guide the country on gossip. We are serious citizens; we need matters documented and deposited with Parliament. 

How did we come to allow Tullow to enter an agreement with Total and CNOC for the US$ 475 million? Where shall we get that tax without wasting the US$ 430 million that we got from Heritage and Tullow in the first place? What the minister’s statement should have read is that, we have so far obtained our US$ 430 million, then we know that we are following the right procedure, and we shall then go and get the US$ 475 million. But the first one is not yet concluded, which would have formed the basis for the second agreement. 

By us messing up the first agreement where we assessed our taxes, it means that even this second agreement is a nullity; it is just estimation. We are guessing how much we are likely to get, but in the actual sense - I wanted the minister to deny it first. Didn’t Ushs 2.9 billion change hands between CNOC and Total, and played into the hands of Tullow? Yes or no? What did we as Ugandans get out of that? And I want to state here that we are still at point zero, Mr Speaker. 

The other point I want to bring up is that point No.4 which reads, “The key considerations for Government’s approval of the new entrants in the sector through these sales have included…” You have talked about the capitalisation and investment capacity of the companies; the technical capacity; experience of these companies; and alignment with Government’s development plans. Mr Minister, when are we going to see the construction of the refinery in this country? Are we going to be selling crude oil? When are we starting? That is one aspect.

But the most important one -(Interruption)

MR ODONGA OTTO: Thank you so much hon. Ssekikubo and Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I am also a member of the Parliamentary Forum on Oil and Gas and my entry into that organisation is through an organisation called Save Our Oil. Now, if you look at paragraph 4 carefully - in fact, what the minister does not want to tell you is this; these few Ugandans had shares in Heritage Oil - the Elly Karuhangas of this world -(Interjections)- yeah. Please, I have information - and many other Ugandans. They went and got sites which they could do nothing with other than slashing and cutting trees and having a semblance of things that look like drills, and yet they are actually borehole machines. (Laughter) So, they waited for these powerful international companies to come and then went and sold their interests to these companies, and made huge profits; and that was the time when the dollar increased in value against the shilling.

Now, the difficulty the minister is having and which this Parliament should know, is that they are now setting new criteria for anyone interested in entering the oil industry after the other Ugandans have already made a good deal with their money and have gone home with it. So, this new criteria will make it a little more difficult for another Heritage of any kind to emerge in Uganda. That is the little information I wanted to give you, and the minister will agree with me on that particular aspect. (Laughter)

MR SSEKIKUBO: Mr Speaker, I would like to yield the Floor, but really who is going to superintend over these considerations by Government if we have no law in place? It means that we are putting the cart before the horse, yet one should be leading the other. Who shall be there to ensure that these standards - these considerations are made? 

And lastly, honourable members, there have been reports in the media about those highly placed officials in Government, who have already had a cut of this oil wealth and incidentally or unfortunately, the ministers’ names came up. Can the minister come clean on this matter? (Interjections) Hon. Hillary Onek together with others have been cited, not in our local gossip, but in international media and on Wikileaks. Their names have featured. 

Can we really be assured, as Ugandans, when we have such a bad deal on our hands and the honourable ministers are being named, and they do not care to come out to clarify and clear their names; they sit here quietly - hon. Hillary Onek, his name is among them; hon. Amama Mbabazi and as usual hon. Sam Kuteesa. (Laughter) With the latter I am not surprised; but where you have names being mentioned and they choose to keep quiet about it; and it is only we trying to get a few details from them. 

Mr Speaker, with the indulgence of Members, I beg that we throw out this statement and we demand a comprehensive detailed statement in a week’s time. I beg to move.

5.30
MR BARNABAS TINKASIIMIRE (NRM, Buyaga County, Kibaale): Thank you very much Mr Speaker. I wish to thank the honourable minister for his very mean statement. Mr Speaker, as early as 2006, the people of Bunyoro who house the oil industry were told that there was going to be an early production of oil and gas by 2009. 

I would want to know how far the honourable minister has gone with this early production project. The people of Bunyoro who I represent have concerns. 97 percent of the population are subsistent farmers; 49 percent are poor; our national budget share is 1.4 percent; our literacy rate is 52 percent; our safe water coverage is 51 percent; and I can go on enumerating our statistics which are very bad. 

Hon. Minister, the people of Bunyoro are concerned about these transactions which are taking place. We, who are housing the whole industry, are demanding that you clearly tell us what our share is from these transactions. I am glad that the Minister of Finance revealed that you have put it in the national budget. We want to see 20 percent of this income invested in Bunyoro sub-region. This will mean that we are going to have at least 86 million in the first transaction invested in Bunyoro and 95 million also invested there. That will surely help us to uplift the poor state of Bunyoro. It is on record that if you go to Bunyoro, what will welcome you is dust. We cannot even sell sausages to the Bazungu who are drilling the oil. So, why can’t you really help us –(Interjection)

MR ODONGA OTTO: Thank you, hon. Tinkasiimire for giving way. I sympathise with your sentiments, but the information I want to give - I remember there was a workshop organised in Entebbe on oil and gas and hon. Onek was making a closing remark on behalf of Uganda Government in the presence of a World Bank expert. 

The minister was saying, “We shall not accept our oil to be traded in London; this is a Ugandan product.” He was raising similar sentiments which you are raising, but the World Bank expert said, “Hon. Minister, we are trading only capital in Europe and not your oil. We are knocking on the doors of the biggest capital owners in the world so that they can come and inject their capital into Uganda.” I saw the minister looking very polite immediately after that submission. 

So, the information I want to give you is that what is currently happening is mobilisation of capital to begin the work – shares. It has nothing to do with anything coming out of the soil of Bunyoro.

MR TINKASIIMIRE: Thank you, hon. Odonga Otto for that good information. I also want to comfortably tell you that this capital is being mobilised on the subject of oil. And this oil is not anywhere else other than in Bunyoro. (Laughter) If you want to say that it is Acholi, why are they not drilling it in Acholi, but they are drilling it in Bunyoro? [HON. MEMBER: “You are spoiling the argument now. Please do not spoil the argument.”] 

Mr Speaker, allow me to proceed by making my last submission. This is a humble request to the people who are in the oil industry. As the people housing this industry, particularly the leaders, we also need information. This is because we often meet the local people who ask us, “What are we going to benefit from oil? What is going on?” We do not know how to answer them, yet they have a lot of anxiety. We have a saying that goes thus: “Aherera ekiswa atukura.” We want to be as red as oil; as rich as the oil owners.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Member, the people of Bunyoro Kingdom are well covered in the Constitution itself. If you read Article 244(3), it says, “Minerals, mineral ores, petroleum shall be exploited taking into account the interests of the individual land owner, local government and Government.” And, therefore, you are definitely covered because you are under the umbrella of this provision. The only thing we need to do is to work out the formula that takes care of the interests of Bunyoro Kingdom.

MR TINKASIIMIRE: Thank you Mr Speaker for that guidance. We are aware that we have good laws that exist in books of law, but they never percolate to the grassroots. We have just been debating about the functionality of Police; Police, according to law, is not supposed to shoot unarmed individuals. But maybe with your force and the force of this Parliament, the ministry will help us the Banyoro. (Laughter) I hope he will hear this –(Interruption)

MS ERIYO: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise on a point of order. Is the Member holding the Floor in order to insinuate that oil is only found in Bunyoro and it is only the Banyoro who have a stake in this oil? 

The information we have is that oil is found in nearly the whole of Western Uganda through the Rift Valley area and it is being explored from Kanungu up to West Nile. Is he in order to make the Banyoro feel that they are the only ones who own this oil?

THE SPEAKER: No, I think he did not have that information. But now that you have given it, you have helped him. But the other aspect is that he had earlier said that he is an effective representative of his people. So, he was demonstrating that he is quite effective. (Laughter) 

MR TINKASIIMIRE: How I wish we could have the same Speaker even in the ninth Parliament! (Laughter) Mr Speaker, I want to wind up by saying that many of the problems we have had in exploring oil, in most cases start from the areas that are housing the oil industry.

So, as a matter of priority, whether this Government likes it or not, they must make us happy. And when I say we are demanding for our share that should not be a problem because it is just 20 percent; you are free to take all the other 80 percent. But we are also saying that you should invest that money in Bunyoro so that when you visit us, you can ride on good roads. This is important because we are tired of dusty roads; we are tired of our children not being able to go to good schools; and we are tired of our women dying. You can proceed.

MR KYETUNDA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I also thank my colleague for giving way. To the best of my knowledge, Kasese has been naturally endowed with these resources since time immemorial. Everybody here can bear me witness that all the copper has been coming from Kasese and right now we have a lot of cement in that place. 

However, I want to point out that we have never stood on the Floor of this Parliament and asked for a portion of the proceeds of these resources to be given to the people of Kasese.

Anyway, on a happy note, Mr Speaker, I would like to say that should that be set as a precedent in this country, then Kasese should be able to benefit from the proceeds of those resources too. Whereas I don’t agree with the a view that we should tribalise resources, if Government does it for the people of Bunyoro, then it must stand firm and give us our portion even in arrears. I thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I think the effective way of addressing the emotions that are coming up is by the government bringing all the necessary laws relating to these resources for the people to know what percentage they are supposed to take. So, the sooner, honourable minister, you bring all the relevant laws, the better for us; it will contribute to calmness as far as debates in the House are concerned.

MR TINKASIMIRE: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I can see the minister taking notes. I hope he has taken note of your guidance. I also would like to thank the honourable member for that good information. However, I would like to say that I have travelled to Kasese – when you drive from Kyenjojo to Mbarara, there are tarmac roads, but when you drive from Kyenjojo to Masindi, you will have to travel on only murram roads with potholes and dust. You can see that there is a very big difference; you have already benefited from the proceeds of copper; and that is why we also want to benefit from the proceeds of oil and we have to, whether you like it or not. (Laughter)

Mr Speaker, I would like to end by asking the individuals who are dealing in this oil – because the issue of saying some minister is already taking cuts, is not nationalistic at all. I would ask that this be investigated and if it is proved that there is a minister who is already taking cuts in our oil, that minister should be dealt with accordingly. Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Do you also have oil in your area? Please answer yes or no. Okay, give the information.

MS BINTU: Thank you, Mr Speaker and the minister for presenting this statement. Mr Speaker, you quoted a provision in the Constitution, but I also know that we have not domesticated that provision. So, it is on this note that I am asking the minister to precisely - because before we took on the minister in this august House, the ministry had not shown any interests of coming up with a policy. They did so after we raised the issue of the need to have a regulation in place. That is when we had the oil policy adopted.

In that regard, let me find out from the minister when he intends to bring, before this august House, the Oil and Gas Law?

Secondly, sometime back, towards the February general elections, you were quoted by the newspapers, while you presented a paper at a certain conference, as saying that a refinery was going to be constructed in a certain place. Can we know from you today, where that refinery is going to be constructed?

I am asking this question because the people of Bunyoro want to know whether you will be transporting the crude oil from there to wherever you intend to construct that refinery. So, can we be informed about this? Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Okay, let us have him because he says he has oil in his place, before we go to hon. Jimmy Akena.

MR STEPHEN KAGWERA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. You will recall that before these people moved to Bunyoro, they were in Bundibugyo, which is adjacent to my constituency. Therefore, I have interests too.

From the statement of the honourable minister in regard to reduction of the monopoly after Heritage Oil sold its shares – to me this issue did not originate from Government; it originated from the Heritage Oil Company. This means Government has lesser control over our resources though apparently we may take it – if you don’t analyse the report properly – that Government has interests. Otherwise, I notice that it is Heritage Oil that initiated this sale. So, it is not about avoiding the monopoly; it was just business acumen of Heritage Oil.

The other issue is about other areas where we still have monopoly and these are in paragraphs 4(b) and 5 where we have Neptune and other companies. I don’t know when these will also sale their shares such that we can have revenue. Other than that, the oil and gas are for Uganda. Otherwise, apparently the way I see it, when these people say, we don’t benefit just like hon. Theodore Sekikubo put it - these people are just doing their business with us getting very little yet the resources are ours.

The other issue upon which Mr Speaker, you commented upon very well is the legal framework. Why don’t we have a legal framework in place first? How can we talk about oil with transactions going on without a serious legal framework?

Let us also talk about information. We need to be sincere with the fact that oil has been monopolised by a few people in Government. And this is evident here when Members of Parliament say they are ignorant about what is happening in regard to oil. So, how would you expect an ordinary Ugandan to know what is happening about oil, when Members of Parliament –

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Member, the minister agreed in his statement that there has been a communication gap, which was an admission. Also, one member suggested that we should have regular briefings by the minister after every three months. I hope that is going to cure this situation.

MR KAGWERA: Thank you for that guidance, Mr Speaker. I, therefore, would like to say that I concur with what hon. Sekikubo said that for now we just throw out the report because it is not conclusive, and ask the minister to bring us a comprehensive one to help Members of Parliament get to know more about this resource.

THE SPEAKER: But by throwing out the report, what are you going to gain. I am saying this because issues have been raised here and you Members have made contributions that are helping the situation. Now, should we throw away whatever you have said?  Yes, hon. Akena.

5.51
MR JIMMY AKENA (UPC, Lira Municipality, Lira): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I wish to thank the honourable minister for bringing this statement. The fact of the matter is that I have been a member of the Committee on Natural Resources for the last four and a half to five years, and I can confidently say I am one of those who can claim to be ignorant on what is going on. (Laughter)	

The minister has helped to clarify that there is either an addendum to the Production Sharing Agreement or there is some other MoU, but as a member of the committee, which should be informing this House, we are ignorant. We have not received sufficient information and we cannot help to guide any discussion or debate. 

Recently, I met somebody who was asking me, as a member of this natural resources committee of the Uganda Parliament, and I had to say, we have no information. I have never seen the Production Sharing Agreement, which was supposed to come to our committee. But I am grateful all the same for the contributions which have been made. It has helped clarify my ignorance, but in other areas it has raised more questions. 

According to the honourable minister, from the sale at US$ 1.35 billion, 30 percent of that is tax, which will end up in the coffers of Uganda. Thirty percent of US$ 1.35 billion is US$ 405 million. You already explained the US$ 150 million is going to sort out something, but in the minister’s statement in paragraph 6, we have US$ 430 million. There is a difference of US$ 25 million, which is not a small amount of money in anybody’s book. Whether this US$ 25 million - where it comes from or where it is going, I really hope the minister can shed some light on that.

And the fact that this money, which is expected, is not yet in the coffers, and nobody can honestly tell us when it will be in the coffers, as the matter is still under arbitration, whether in London or Uganda. This process can take the next five years and we will not see this money. Even if it is budgeted, as the minister of state said, it does not mean we will receive and be able to utilise it. 

So, on that basis, I really hope the minister can come out and be very clear on these figures because $US 25 million is not a small amount of money. It cannot be a typographical error because if we took the original figure of US$ 1.5 billion, it would be US$ 450 million. So, I don’t see where the US$ 430 million comes from according to your figures and the percentages. (Hon. Member: “Stamp Duty”) Stamp Duty! Thank you for that one. 

Lastly, a few years ago, I tried to find out who owns the companies which have been exploring in Uganda. When you go into the shareholding, you find layers upon layers. At the end of the day, it is almost impossible to determine who owns the companies. 

I asked officials in the ministry of energy and they were least concerned. But when it comes to other matters, we are very concerned where the source of the funding is coming from, especially in politics. 

When it comes to this important sector, which we are envisaging will play a key role in Uganda’s development; we are least concerned as to where the funding is coming from and who the owners of the company are. You find Shell companies owned by other Shell companies and after peeling back about five layers, I gave up. You keep peeling this onion and you keep finding other layers. And it is virtually impossible to know, and I doubt whether the ministry has any idea of who the real shareholders are. 

They may know some of the shareholding but they don’t know the full shareholding. Because in one company, by the time I got to the second and third layer – it was owned by a company which the former Minister of Ethics would cringe to know that this company has shares in Ugandan oil. My brother, Bahati, would not be amused but that is the reality of what we are dealing with. 

The minister’s statement helped to clarify in one area that the speculators are being phased out and the serious oil companies are coming in; but the speculators have the licenses.

Some of the Members have talked about Bunyoro oil, but I wish to point out that the land of my forefathers falls under one of the blocks; I think it is Block 5, which we have not yet licensed. We are not in Bunyoro; we are in Lango, across the river. We hosted Kabalega when he was on his way out and the oil belt extends beyond Bunyoro. Although much of the work has been done in Bunyoro, we know it extends beyond Bunyoro.

So, I thank the minister for coming up with this clarification, but your clarification has raised more questions. I really hope that the ministry can come out clearly and help us understand. I await the ministry’s appearance in the natural resources committee to give us details. Hopefully at the end of it, I will cease to be an ignorant member of the committee and of this House. I thank you, Mr Speaker.

5.59
MR PATRICK AMURIAT (FDC, Kumi County, Kumi): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for giving me this chance. I wish to thank my friend, hon. Hillary Onek, for this brief statement to the House.

I have a few questions for which I require answers arising from his statement. The first question to the minister is whether we got a good deal from the sale of interests by Heritage-Tullow Oil and subsequently the 66.6 percent to Shell and CNOC.

I appreciate the fact that this may have been drawn from the experience of other countries, as is clearly stated in bullet 7 of the minister’s statement to this House. 

My brother, hon. Akena, has already raised the red flag about US$ 25 million that is not declared in this statement. I would like to further state that US$ 430 million for the sale of two exploration areas, 1 and 3A, which was a 100 percent sale, doesn’t favourably compare with the US$ 475 million that was realised from the sale of 66.6 percent of exploration areas 1, 2 and 3(a). I would like clarification from the minister on this.

I would also like to know from the minister when we are actually going to physically realise this money, because in his own statement, he says we just expect this money. Is this money real? How can we guarantee that if we budgeted for this money, it will be able to service the next financial year’s budget, or are we really relying on our dreams and wishes?

The other question I would like to ask arises from bullet No.9 of the minister’s statement and this is to do with recoverable costs. Much as the minister states that the Auditor General would audit whatever costs are presented by the exploration companies, practically, who is there to watch our interests as a country? (Interruption)

MR ODONGA OTTO: Thank you so much, hon. Amuriat, for giving way. On bullet nine on recoverable costs, hon. Minister, you were there in the training together with me, and the World Bank experts advised that it is irresponsible for any country or any Government in the world to start extracting oil without having a technical person on behalf of Government inspecting the costs.

He went ahead to say, for example, that other companies may use chemicals, which are dangerous to the environment, so that they reach the oil wells faster, but when they are costing, they can cost that they drilled 1000 metres deep of hard rock. So, do we have any person on site, as of now, that is counting how many pipes are being put, or how many gallons of oil are being used? Because at the end of the day, these national companies will factor this cost and will tell us that they need 20 years to recover their costs. Do we have any person there in line with the advice the World Bank experts gave us in your presence?

MR AMURIAT: Thank you very much, my brother hon. Otto for that information. The hon. Minister is a seasoned civil engineer and he knows that in engineering terms, when a site is open there has to be the presence of the employer at every stage of works. This is why we have clerks of works on site. 

Who is the clerk of works in the case of these exploration sites that we are talking about? How are we going to be convinced that what the company on site will declare to us is true? They may come and say we drilled so many kilometres of hard rock, but in the absence of a person observing our interests as a country, we have no defence. Where is your defence, Mr Minister?

In conclusion, I would like to comment on the concluding statement of the minister to this House. He observes that now that the sales have been concluded, they are now in a position to proceed with appraisal and development of the other oil fields.

Mr Speaker, this is a poor country endowed with a lot of natural resources. I do not know why Government had to wait until such a time when the sales that have been referred to in this statement were concluded before appraisal and development commenced. Did you have to wait for that to happen? Where is the problem, Mr Minister, that would stop you from proceeding with the other oil wells even as negotiations and agreements on one, two and 3(a) proceeded? Mr Speaker, I thank you.

THE SPEAKER: I think you have raised the points. I will now ask the minister to respond.

6.02
THE MINISTER OF ENERGY AND MINIERAL DEVELOPMENT (MR Hillary Onek): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker and thank you very much colleagues for your reaction to this paper. I know some like my sister hon. Beatrice Anywar will say, “Order” as soon as she sees me even if I have said nothing, so it is something small.

Coming down to the point here, since I joined the ministry, there were all these myths about secrecy. I went ahead and brought the Production Sharing Agreement here and I said we should handle it carefully. Why? Because at that particular time, there were some neighbouring countries who did not know how to go about preparing the Production Sharing Agreement because it costs money and consultancy. Some of them wanted to pirate ours in order to copy it and that is the reason why we were a bit cautious in whose hands this document would land, but in Parliament, definitely, you are free to look at it wherever it is. I am sorry for the impression that was created.

The legal framework and laws governing this oil industry is going to be brought -(Interruption)- I haven’t given you, let me continue. [Hon. Banyenzaki: “Order”] It is my right to accept or not.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, let us not use these things in such a way. You came, I think, for clarification; and according to our Rules of Procedure, the person holding the Floor is the one to give you an opportunity to seek clarification or to give information. He has a right to say yes or no. But you can’t turn something, which was for information because somebody has exercised his right then -(Laughter)- Make the point which you wanted to make, because I think you wanted him to sit so that you can make your point. Make it.

MR BANYENZAKI: Thank you, Mr Speaker for your guidance to me not to make an order, which I was going to make and seek clarification. 

Mr Speaker, out of the statement the honourable minister has just made, he said that anybody who wants can access the Production Sharing Agreement he lay on the Table for everybody to see. I welcome it with open hands. But I had told you, and I am passionately talking about this, that I have written two letters to the Clerk and these two letters were also copied to your office, requesting to have accessibility to the Production Sharing Agreement, as they are very crucial.

Mr Speaker, you realise that Members of Parliament who would have wanted to contribute to this very important issue and debate cannot do it because they are not informed. You also made a statement that we are depending on the newspapers; it is because we are frustrated.

Hon. Minister, now that you have retracted your words, when you were tabling those Production Sharing Agreements, you even led the Deputy Speaker to make a ruling that for anybody to access those Production Sharing Agreements, there must be modalities and procedures, which will be made by the Office of the Speaker. 

So, are you saying that you have now removed those conditions of Members of Parliament having a procedure of accessing the Memorandum of Agreement?  Are you saying that we should now have copies in our pigeonholes because we need to read them, Mr Speaker? That is the clarification I would like the minister to make. 

I would also like to know whether those addendums that he has committed to bring before the House will be got without conditionalities and when is he bringing them? 

MS ANYWAR: Thank you, hon. Banyenzaki. I would like the minister to tell the House when he will be presenting to this House the newly negotiated Production Sharing Agreement so that we can hold our fire on other issues and also be on board with the new terms in the agreement. Because as we talk, we do not know whether you re-negotiated only one clause or the whole of it, and I do not think, legally, it could be holding that we are talking about an agreement which is probably different. When will you present that to this House? Thank you. 
                                                                                                            
THE MINISTER OF ENERGY AND MINERAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr Hillary Onek): Thank you very much, colleagues. You have been very supportive, which has really made me happy. I think those documents are public documents. The Production Sharing Agreements (PSA) are now in Parliament and they are at your discretion to have them.

The MoU which we have signed will be brought and tabled here even tomorrow, it does not really matter to me when.  I will bring it tomorrow if I am in Parliament. But whichever way, it will be availed to Parliament. 

The legal framework is currently before Cabinet and I will work hard to ensure that it is tabled here in the House within two weeks. We shall work very hard to ensure that we Table it within the shortest possible time for debate.  

There are all those other statements, some of which I will not even divulge into because I will not know to what extent speculators have operated in the Bunyoro oil fields, some of whom might have reaped huge profits and so on. I would not know; I only know the formal things that happened. 

Talking about the Wikileaks stories which reported negatively about me among others, I remember during that period when Heritage was trying to sell their interests to an Italian company, some directors of Tullow Oil waged war on me; as to why I would allow this company to buy off Heritage; and they mounted a propaganda war against me. 

They went around the diplomatic community including Americans to spoil my name so as to create an impression that -(Interjections) - I am answering your questions. So, my lawyers have written to Tullow  and I have written to the American Ambassador through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seek confirmation of those conversations because I intended to and I still intend to take the Tullow Director who made those statements -(Interjections)- come on, why can’t we be civilised? Allow me speak and then you –(Laughter)

I would like to take them to court because I have never done what they reported. If I were to do it when they were pressurising me, and I mentioned this in the press that they were coming through the windows and so forth - but I would never allow them - that is the time that I would have accepted. Actually, that was the best opportunity for these fellows to come and corrupt me so that I serve their interests; but I never allowed it. And then they chose another option of going through telling lies to the diplomatic community and so on. But that is a side issue that I am handling differently.

Talking about the promise of early oil production in 2006, it is true that those statements were made, but when more oil was discovered, it was found necessary for the government to set up a much bigger refinery. Therefore, in 2008-2009 the government commissioned a refinery study which was completed around December last year and we are at the moment working on the procurement process to bring competent oil firms to do the refinery in Uganda. The site will be at a place called Kabaale, not Kibaale, in Hoima. (Laughter) So, that is briefly what I should say.

Talking about infrastructure, Government has planned comprehensive infrastructure around the oil refinery. There is also a planned big 3.5 kilometer long airport of international standard in Hoima. First class roads are also planned to be built in all that oil area. So, the infrastructure will be up to date. It will probably be the best in Uganda once completed. (Interjections)  Why don’t you get satisfied with this? (Laughter) 

MR SSEKIKUBO: Thank you, hon. Minister, for giving way. I am enthused to hear that modern infrastructure is being organised for the Bunyoro region. But to me, the honourable minister and Government should not fall in the temptation of thinking that this oil resource is to benefit only Bunyoro. What I would have expected to hear is that it is part of a comprehensive national programme where even Sembabule, which has no deposits, thank God –(Interruption)

PROF. KABWEGYERE: Mr Speaker, the infrastructure that is being talked about is for the area where the oil is being refined. Is the honourable member in order to imagine that Sembabule should benefit from roads which are meant for the oil producing area? (Laughter)

THE SPEAKER: No, I have no doubt that hon. Ssekikubo is aware that the minister we have here is the Minister of Energy. He was just addressing a subject of his ministry and he was talking about oil and refinery and the facilities that are going to be provided there. But his observation has merits though it should be addressed to the Minister of Works.

MR ONEK: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker and colleagues. I think as of now, the tax money which we are talking about is not oil money because the real oil money will come when we start producing and selling oil. Government will take its shares from the oil and also tax the profit and so forth. We will enact the law and in the areas where oil is being produced, they will definitely share certain portions because of the activities there. Just like in the mining sector, laws are spelt out clearly on how proceeds from the mines are shared. So, this is something that should not generate sectarian animosity among us because we are one country, irrespective of whether there is oil in our districts or not. For example, in Sembabule, there are only cows but the oil money should take roads there. 

I have already answered hon. Bintu’s question. I stated that we are working on the laws, but I am going to bring the MoU to Parliament. 

Let me explain further the rationale of the tax. The Shs 1.35 billion is exactly 30 percent of that money; that is Shs 405 million. There is an element of stamp duty which was added – included - and that makes it Shs 430 million. So, that is why the figure reads differently from the percentage. The Shs 475 million is derived like this because Tullow Oil first bought the Heritage assets at Shs 1.5 billion; that asset was added together with the other blocks and they are now getting out what they got at Shs 2.9 billion. Shs 1.5 billion has been deducted from that because they have paid. So, what will remain for taxation purposes is the Shs 1.4 billion, and if you apply the 30 percent plus, the stamp duty and so on, it comes to about Shs 475 million. 

When giving these new companies the exploration and production licence, there will be a signature bonus. Whenever I append my signature, there will be payment to Government. So, my signature will cost anything up to one million or so, but those are some of the activities that are done in the oil sector. (Laughter)

Hon. Akena, I liked your question. It is true you did not get it, but I have now explained to you how these taxes have been worked out. “Who owns the oil company?” I know that it is Tullow Oil, but as to who Tullow Oil is, I do not have the authority to lift the veil. There is what in law they call “lifting the veil” to know the owners. So, I do not know -(Interruption)

MS AKELLO: Mr Speaker, I thank the minister for giving way. You are talking about hon. Akena’s point of ignorance on certain issues to do with oil because there are some talks that oil extends to Sudan, and for some of us along that belt like in Acholi and Amuru –(Interjections)- I travelled to the West Nile late last year and I saw some big machines and I wonder whether they are for drilling oil in Amuru District. Hon. Minister, during campaign time, the people of Acholi asked whether oil is actually more as you tend towards Sudan. So, can you tell us before we warm up or get excited about it?

MR ONEK: Thank you very much, my sister. Uganda is very rich in mineral resources. Oil is currently being prospected along the Albertine and along both sides of R. Nile. There is indication that there is oil on the side of Amuru and on the West Nile side. As to whether they are of a commercial quantity shall be ascertained through drilling and doing the relevant studies of the place. I strongly believe that it is expanding beyond that but our experts will have to work on it. I even believe that certain corridors of Karamoja have oil or gas. So, those are all areas to be prospected and we shall work on that. 

As I mentioned earlier, recoverable costs will be the costs used in drilling and extracting oil and developing the sites. That is what will be factored in, as a cost. The others are just perception costs. But I will ask my petroleum exploration department to work out a detailed paper to update Parliament on the costs that are ongoing before the Auditor-General looks through, because –(Interjections)– yes, we have our commissioners right there. Actually, we have over 10 well-trained oil engineers and they are stationed at every oil well – 

THE SPEAKER: I think hon. Amuriat was asking you whether you have the equivalent of a Clerk of Works in respect of this development at the site so that the costs are not exaggerated. 

MR ONEK: We have. Actually, on a daily and hourly basis, there is communication between our engineers in the field and the headquarters where they monitor every oil well. So, we are monitoring them very closely. It is a very sensitive area because these oil companies are very crafty and they can do anything if you are not there. We have trained enough personnel and there are more who are abroad, who are also undergoing similar training. So, I think we are covered there. 

There was a statement that it is dangerous to start drilling oil without –(Interjections)- we have answered that one. In fact, for your information, the discovery of this oil in the Lake Albert area was done by our group. The original group called the Hardman Resources Limited drilled and found some Carbondioxide and they gave up and said there was no oil. It was our geologists, among them Eng. Rubondo sitting right there, who insisted that there is oil. They went and showed Tullow Oil where to drill and these people drilled and hit oil. It was our people who did that. 

MR AKENA: I wish to take this opportunity to inform the minister that the oil in Uganda was known for quite some time. Even the law which formed the basis of exploration was enacted under the UPC Government in 1984. Check your records.

MR ONEK: Thank you very much, hon. Akena. It is true that there were traces of oil in L. Albert. The British drilled, but they did not find it. In Butiaba, there is a well which was drilled and they never accomplished because they did not get the oil. However, at the lake, there used to be tar floating which was a clear indication that there is oil. Government at the time knew that there was oil. I fully agree that there was knowledge, but it was not attested knowledge. There was no exploration done; the British attempted and they gave up.

So, that is all I can say. I would like to thank you very much colleagues for your contributions; some of them were informative.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Minister, it is our understanding that you will be giving regular briefings from your ministry, quarterly.

MR ONEK: Yes, Mr Speaker. I will ensure that the communication gap does not occur again because previously, we started a bit, but it is now four months since I presented the Production Sharing Agreements. I think we shall continue partnering with you and I will need your help because these oil companies are dangerous. I will need your help to support me. We shall be sharing information with you.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much, hon. Minister for the statement and the responses you have given.

MR MUKITALE: Mr Speaker, just one very important point. The Minister of Energy has done his part and it is good he has promised routine briefing, but the industry is evolving more into finance; it is a commodity, it is taxable, they are licensing and they are bringing new companies. Could we get the same version from Ministry of Finance, which is currently – because, if we do not get that, the tax law, Ministry of Energy has nothing to do with it. It will come from Finance and we would want an equivalent of a statement from Finance and where the money that we are taxing is going right now.

THE SPEAKER: Can we get just two questions and maybe we close.

QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER

QUESTION 104/1/08 TO THE MINISTER 
OF DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND REFUGEES

6.34
MR ALEX BYARUGABA (NRM, Isingiro County South, Isingiro): Mr Speaker, question 104/1/08: “For over four years now, almost 2100 Ugandans have been encamped at Kikagati sub-county having been chased from Tanzania where they had settled. What plans does the government have to resettle these suffering Ugandans?”

6.34
THE MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER (RELIEF & DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND REFUGEES) (Prof. Tarsis Kabwegyere): Thank you, Mr Speaker. The question is: “For over four years now, almost 2100 Ugandans have been encamped at Kikagati sub-county having been chased from Tanzania where they had settled. What plans does the government have to resettle these suffering Ugandans?”

There have been so far, four phases of expulsions of Ugandans from the United Republic of Tanzania. In the early 1990s, officials in the Karagwe region of the United Republic of Tanzania expelled 811 Ugandans who had informally settled there. This group who were mostly agriculturalists camped for a short time at Kikagati sub-county in Isingiro District. They were screened and were all found to be Ugandans. They were resettled in Kagadi Resettlement Scheme in the current Kibaale District.

In the year 2000, officials in the same region of Tanzania expelled 2804 Ugandans who were also agriculturalists, forcing them back without any of their personal belongings and livelihood assets. They camped at Kikagati sub-county headquarters for some time. Attempts to resettle this group in the available 15 square miles of Government land in Kagadi Resettlement Scheme met stiff resistance from the Kibaale District. Eventually, land was identified in Kahunje sub-county, Kamwenge District, formerly used by the Rwandese refugees who had returned home; where the Directorate of Relief, Disaster Preparedness and Refugees resettled all of them -

THE SPEAKER: Hon. professor, my concern is, we have been talking about this several times. These answers should be brief and as I see, this question from hon. Byarugaba is only interested in plans by Government to resettle because in some jurisdictions, 40 questions are answered within an hour. So, this was planned; just tell us the plan and we go to another question.

PROF. KABWEGYERE: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I agree with you and I will do exactly that. The only problem is that, I had wanted the Members to realise that resettlement is not as simple as it appears, but I will now come to the solution on page 3.

His Excellency, the President, in September 2009, authorised the Directorate of Disaster Preparedness and Refugees in the Office of the Prime Minister to use part of the land, the 30 square miles belonging to the National Political School in Kyankwanzi and part of Nshara Ranch in Kiruhura District, as resettlement of landless disaster victims.

In addition, the Directorate of Relief, Disaster Preparedness and refugees has made provisions in the budget, of Shs 5 billion for annual procurement of land and resettlement of 10,000 landless people or people at risk of landslides, floods and overpopulated areas in the next five years.

The 800 Ugandans expelled from Tanzania will be settled in Kyankwanzi District on part of the National Political School land. The resettlement will be carried out from August 2011 because the funds available now are only enough for resettlement and construction of 1500 houses for the Bududa landslides survivors in Kiryandongo District. 

I would really like to inform the honourable Members that this resettlement is going to be a first of its kind, but I hope it will not be an allurement for any group to say, “We also get settled and we be given the same facilities”.

The Directorate of Relief, Disaster Preparedness and Refugees will, however, continue supplying relief food and non-food commodities to the 800 expellees camped at Kikagati sub-county headquarters until the time when they will be moved to Kyankwanzi District. Thank you.

MR ALEX BYARUGABA (NRM, Isingiro County South, Isingiro): Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable minister for this brief presentation that has given me and the people I represent some hope. I hope that my colleagues, Members of Parliament who have similar problems in their respective constituencies, at least now have where to start from. I have heard one good piece of information that starting next financial year, we are going to have Shs 5 billion. I wish it could be a little more, but all the same, I want to thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Okay, next question; hon. Okello-Okello.

QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER

Question 118/1/08 TO THE MINISTER OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENT 

6.41
MR LIVINGSTONE OKELLO-OKELLO (UPC, Chua County, Kitgum): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Question 118/1/08 reads: 

i)	“Is the Minister aware that over the last one year or so, there has been harvesting of timber from Abera Forest in Paicho Sub-County, Aswa County, Gulu District?
ii)	Can the Minister inform the House how much revenue has been earned so far by the state from this timber harvest?
iii)	How many companies are involved in this timber harvest and who owns them?”

6.41
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR ENVIRONMENT (Ms Jessica Eriyo): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank my colleague hon. Okello-Okello for asking this question. The question is, “Is the Minister aware that over the last one year or so there has been harvesting of timber from Abera Forest in Paicho Sub-County, Aswa County, Gulu District?"

The answer is, I am aware that the National Forest Authority invited bids to harvest plantations in Abera Central Forest Reserve, and has licenced saw millers and individuals to harvest pine trees in Abera Forest Reserve since 2006. 

I would like to add that this is a plantation forest and the purpose here is to have those trees harvested and then replanted. The pine trees were planted in 1967 and 1968, and are now aged 38-39 years and are over mature. Some are dying and others are bearing wood that has deteriorated and is less valuable for many uses. The economic financial rotation age to harvest pine trees in Uganda is 20 to 30 years. 

Question No.2 is, “Can the Minister inform the House how much revenue has been earned so far by the state from this timber harvest?”

The revenue that accrued from licencing the timber harvesting in Abera Central Reserve is Shs 1,705,378,750 only, which is National Forestry Authority Revenue and this is usually utilised at source.

Question No.3 is, “How many companies are involved in this timber harvest and who owns them?” Mr Speaker, NFA issued a total of 49 timber harvesting licences in Abera Central Forest Reserve; thirteen of them to companies and eight to individuals, since 2006. The list of the companies and their proprietors are shown in the table below. 

Mr Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for the question.

6.44
MR LIVINGSTONE OKELLO-OKELLO (UPC, Chua County, Kitgum): Thank you, Mr Speaker, I have two supplementary questions. The first one is, what was the ministry doing when the trees were over maturing? Were they not aware of the age of the forest? (Laughter) This led to a loss to Government.

Secondly, I use that road going up to Kitgum; the forests are being burnt every year, right from Nakasongola up to here. Even Abera was burnt last year and this year it was burnt again. In the past, the forests used to be protected from bush fire. It seems the minister is now milking a cow without looking after it or feeding it. Is that correct?

THE SPEAKER: Well, but that cannot be a supplementary question to the answers given; the first question is okay, but the last one is not. 

MR OKUPA: Mine is not a supplementary, but I want to bring this issue to the attention of the minister; she was quoting the value, but you need to be cautious of the value you quote here, because we have got information in our committee that the officials in National Forestry Authority – in fact, before you expelled that other man who was found with Shs 900 million under his pillow – we were told that the officials undervalued the trees and later on shared the money after the proprietors had been given licences. 

There is one forest in West Nile; I will give you the details later, but that is what is happening; we would be able to realise the move than what we have here.

THE SPEAKER: Maybe the question should be, “Is there a system where you monitor the revenue collected by National Forestry Authority and the use?”

6.47
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR ENVIRONMENT (Ms Jessica Eriyo): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to start by answering the question you have just asked. Yes, we have a system that monitors them through the Directorate of Environment Affairs and the Department of Forestry Sector Support. The only challenge we have had is that the department was understaffed and underfunded. But now, the staffing has been improving and funding is also being improved in the directorate.

We are also relying on the information from the district forestry officers to give us information. But we are also open to the public for information and I think the public is protected under the Whistle Blowers Act; if there is any information like that for us to follow up.

Then, supplementary question 1, “What was the ministry doing when the trees were maturing?”

I think my colleague knows very well that that region was war-torn  for a very long time and it was very difficult to implement activities in that part of the country. 

Mr Speaker, I have been on the committee that went to investigate the status of the IDPs and it was troublesome for us to move through some of these parts; and particularly in this very constituency. 

So, I would like to inform the honourable colleague and Members that a number of our staff have risked their lives even in areas that do not have war, just to go and monitor; we have lost a number of staff. 

So, where there has been war, even the private sector would not go there to harvest the trees. By the time we started giving out the licences, the war situation in that area had subsided. 

MR OKELLO-OKELLO: Mr Speaker, I think this House should get the correct information. It is not true that, the non-harvest was due to the war. Two other forests were harvested during the war under the protection of the Army. One was called Angagura Forest and another was called Padibe Forest; they were harvested and completed under the protection of the Army. That was during the very bad time of war, 1991 – 1992. 

THE SPEAKER: Okay, maybe the question now would be, “Have you mechanisms now to prevent the loss suffered as a result of over-aging of the trees so that other forests do not suffer the same problem that was experienced?”

MS ERIYO: Yes, Mr Speaker, as I speak now, we have a shortage of mature trees to harvest in the country, but I would like to say that all the mature trees in this country will be harvested in time. 

The other question is that the forest is being burnt, year in, year out. Mr Speaker, I do not know which particular years because there are times when the National Forestry Authority was not able to put fire lines around the forest reserves because of the insecurity, but also because of shortage of funding. 

Also, in the North, people eagerly wait for the dry season and then set fire on any small bushes because they want to hunt for wild animals - wild rats. So, this is a culture all of us should work together to fight as leaders in this country. You see very nice forests and the forests also need some vegetation cover to contain some moisture because if you remove all the vegetation cover on the ground; the trees may not have enough moisture. At night during the dry season, you get some dew, which helps to cool the area. So, you are not supposed to clear the bushes completely. What we need to do is to put a fire line. But there are times when people go and set the fire inside the forest. These are very difficult situations. I would like to request my colleague to work with us - with the ministry - to report such culprits. 

I would like to thank hon. Okupa for his intervention. It is true that in some instances, some officials undervalue the trees so that they can have those deals. I would like to request him that if he has specific information, he should provide it to me. I am wondering why he is keeping it with him and maybe he is aiding corruption; but I know him as a person who does not aid corruption. So, let us work together on this one. I thank you very much, Mr Speaker.
