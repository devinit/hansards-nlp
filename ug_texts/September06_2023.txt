I wonder whether we still have ministers. Members have issues; how do we handle House sittings without ministers?  Honourable members, I am not sure that we are going to continue like this. I need to talk to the Executive on this matter. (Applause)  If this House is only meant for Members of Parliament, then let us be told so. If we are supposed to have ministers that represent the Executive, then we should have ministers on the Front Bench. Otherwise, we cannot come here as Members of Parliament, waste our time, talk when nobody is here to respond yet those supposed to respond are paid highly; we have 83 ministers.
