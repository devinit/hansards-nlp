PRAYERS

(The Deputy Speaker, Ms Anita Among, in the Chair.)

The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I want to thank the ministers who have fulfilled their obligations of submitting ministerial policy statements in accordance with my earlier guidelines. 

Today is the deadline for submission of the ministerial policy statements as provided for under sections 13(13) of the Public Finance Management Act and rule 146(1) of the Rules of Procedure of this House. The House intends to complete the budgeting process in time; we do not want to delay the budgeting process.

I also want to implore the shadow cabinet ministers to have the alternative policy statements laid on the Table by the 29th of March, in accordance with rule 147 of the Rules of Procedure.

I wish to remind the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to present the proposed annual budget for the next financial year by 1 April 2022, in accordance with section 13 of the Public Finance Management Act and rule 148 of the Rules of Procedure.

Honourable members, our rules require sectoral committees to consider and review the policy statements and the budget estimates, and report to the House by 20 April. Therefore, when we get the policy statements, we will refer them to the sectoral committees, which should report to the House. Please make your programmes in accordance with rule 149(1).

The House shall consider reports of sectoral committees and refer the approved recommendations to the Budget Committee for reconciliation, harmonisation and consolidation before it reports back to the House in April, in accordance with rule 149(2). 

Honourable members, the Budget Committee shall present the report to the House not later than 15th May in accordance rule 149(3).

All this time that we are going to have is budgeting time. Therefore, we need to do our work in time so that we do not go against the statutory dates.

Let me take the opportunity to remind the ministers responsible to table the tax and revenue Bills as soon as possible. Of course, rule 150 requires us to ensure we consider the Bills that will help us operationalise tax collection, as the Committee of Supply. 

We need to know where the money that we shall spend will come from. The House must know the size of the estimated resource envelope that we shall spend in the next budgeting period. Even when doing appropriation, it has to be according to what we are going to collect.

As I conclude, it has been brought to my attention that some honourable members of Parliament were unable to make declarations of their assets and liabilities as instructed under Section 4 of the Leadership Code Act, yet this is a very serious matter. So, kindly ensure you follow up and do the declarations. If it means going to the IGG to do that, please follow up. I was given a list of those who have not done so. I have been trying to get in touch with you on how you can handle it; please declare, it is for your own good because we should work within the law.

Honourable members, we are going to have one item on the Order Paper. Therefore, allow me amend the Order Paper and go to Laying of Papers, which is item 4(b). Remember, today is the deadline and we must have the papers laid today. 

Minister of Local Government -

2.07
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Ms Victoria Busingye): Thank you, Madam Speaker. The Ministry of Local Government has already –(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: There is a procedural matter -

MR SSEMUJJU: Thank you, Madam Speaker. As I raise this procedural issue, maybe I should also find out from you if some colleagues on the other side are now exempted from putting on masks, as you can see the MP for Bukanga. 

Anyway, the issue I am raising is: in the past, when these policy statements were laid here, we were allowed to go and scrutinise them in the committees without having to attend plenary.

I sit on the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs and we have more than 15 entities that appear before it. My former chairman, who is now assigned to superintend over the military, can testify. At one time, we sat in the mornings and afternoon. 

Therefore, the procedural issue I am raising is, if the requirement to lay the statements is made today, will you allow us to go and scrutinise these policy statements without having to attend plenary? I said - and I am not the chairperson of the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs; I am only speaking basing on the experience we have gone through in the past, Madam Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you so much. Let us first receive the documents and then we will take a decision later. Otherwise, I, of course, want the committees to finish up with the harmonisation of the policy statements. We will definitely give committees time to do the work after receiving these policy statements. 

Members, I am not going to allow points of procedure, order and what not; I want the policy statements laid. There is no urgent matter for now. I want policy statements. The urgent matter I have now is the policy statements.

Honourable members, in the public gallery this afternoon, we have a delegation from the Kitgum caucus. They are represented by Hon. Lillian Aber. They have come to observe the proceedings of the House. Where are you? Please stand up. You are most welcome and thank you for coming to your Parliament. This is the Parliament of Uganda.

MR SSEWUNGU: Madam Speaker, last time, the Ministry of Education and Sports tabled a policy statement for the agriculture ministry, instead of the education ministry. We got this information from the committee. The guidance I am seeking is whether you can allow me look at it briefly, as a member of the committee. (Interjection) Since one Member has seen it, my heart is at rest.

MINISTRY OF TOURISM, WILDLIFE AND ANTIQUITIES

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM, WILDLIFE AND ANTIQUITIES (Mr Martin Bahinduka): The report is about to get here. I am disappointed in the technical team because they should have been ready by now. By the time the other reports are concluded, our report will be ready – 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members of the Frontbench, I have been reminding you about the deadline. If you people are not ready to take up the task the President gave you, why don’t you resign? (Applause)

This is a deadline you cannot amend. Honourable Government Chief Whip, I want a response on what is happening to your people. If you do not bring a policy statement, we will not work on your budget. We do not mind if you do not come; just send somebody to lay it on the Table.

There was, however, a decision in this House that science and technology should be under the President’s Office but have its own vote and not under State House. That is what is happening.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. The policy statement is referred to the Committee on Presidential Affairs. Any other policy statement? Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives has not laid. East African Community Affairs?

MR SSEMUJJU: Madam Speaker, the minister responsible for East African Community Affairs is one of the Prime Minister’s deputies. It will be a very big failure for the Prime Minister not to supervise her deputies. Now that she is here, can she either lay or tell us why this particular minister never attends Parliament? (Laughter)

MR ENOS ASIIMWE: Madam Speaker, the rules are very clear. The Order Paper is telling us to lay papers but not to ask questions or even debate. I believe my honourable colleague is wrong to ask the Prime Minister questions when we are laying papers, as per the Order Paper.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Enos, these papers are laid and referred to the sectoral committees, which will harmonise the National Budget Framework Paper with the ministerial statements and align them with the National Development Plan and then report back.

We do not have statements for tourism, trade, foreign affairs, Auditor-General and East African Community Affairs. Leader of Government Business, those are the statements we do not have.

2.38
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Ms Robinah Nabbanja): Madam Speaker, laying our policy statements here is a constitutional requirement. I have just talked to the minister for tourism and he is waiting for his technical people to bring the statement. Two, I believe that they are coming by the end of this sitting because they are all aware that today is the deadline. I have tried to whip.

To my brother, I think I will just invite you for a cup of tea (Laughter)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, there is a document being laid by the minister for finance. Honourable minister, just lay your document. 

2.39
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (PLANNING) (Mr Amos Lugoloobi): Thank you so much, Madam Speaker. I beg to lay on the Table, a motion for a resolution of Parliament to authorise domestic borrowing, amounting to Shs 2.049 trillion, to finance supplementary expenditure under schedule 1, which was passed by Parliament. I beg to lay.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: We refer that motion and request to the Committee on National Economy to handle and to report back to the House.

Honourable members and the ministers who have been able to lay their statements, I want to thank you so much. Thank you for the commitment and for abiding by the statutory date. For the ministries that have not laid their statements, remember it is a statutory requirement; we will need an explanation to this House, in writing. (Applause)

2.46
THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Mr Mathias Mpuuga): Thank you, Madam Speaker. First of all, I would like to appreciate the frontbenchers on your right, that have been able to meet the statutory requirement and laid their Ministerial Policy Statements here.

That said and done, Madam Speaker - and the Prime Minister who has not superintended over her duties should not be indulging in your business now, but to listen. 

Two issues, namely, the other time, you ordered that the Opposition will respond by 29th. Now that the ministers are laggards in this business, would it be okay if you vacated that position to allow us space to receive these slow movers, Madam Speaker?

Two, Madam Speaker, we received the National Budget Framework Paper, which was referred to the budget committee, together with the alternative and they were processed. A number of issues changed. We do not know, without a final Budget Framework Paper document, what are we receiving now, Madam Speaker?

Three, we received a Charter of Fiscal Responsibility, together with the alternative, upon which the Committee on Budget reported, including multiple variations. We do not have the revised charter tabled and a revised BFP, tabled. Madam Speaker, what are the ministers laying, without having the final documents tabled?

Madam Speaker, I envisage there is a very serious procedural flaw. I actually thought that today, the finance minister would seek space and lay those final documents, before laying the policy statements because we are already dealing with another problem with the Budget committee, where appropriation and accountability were mishandled. Here we are, again, sitting on another problem that would really border on illegality, Madam Speaker.

DR BARYOMUNSI: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker and the honourable Leader of the Opposition for ceding space –(Interjection)– Okay, Rt Hon. Leader of the Opposition –(Laughter).

My friend, Hon. Mpuuga, I know the laws and the Rules of Procedure of Parliament provide for the other side to give us alternative policy statements, but I am not very certain that the rules clearly say that when you provide the alternatives, Government must necessarily amend what it has brought. 

Could you clarify perhaps which rule requires us to amend what we have brought, after you have submitted your alternatives, so that you say we have not complied with a particular rule –(Interjection) - yes, I am senior; that is why I am asking him. (Laughter)

MR MPUUGA: Madam Speaker, with due respect to the honourable minister for information –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Rule 147 states that, “Shadow ministers may submit the alternative policy statements to Parliament by the 29th day of March every year” and this is also indicated - the date of 29th is indicated. That is why I communicated to you that we should have it on 29th. I appreciate what you are going through, but these dates were set by you and I.

MR MPUUGA: Thank you for your guidance, Madam Speaker. The background to that procedural matter –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: There is something that has not been clarified. What he is asking about is the revised BFP and then the Charter of Fiscal Responsibility - no, it is not Hon. Dr Baryomunsi to do it; it is finance. 

MR MPUUGA: Yes, but initially, to tell the Hon. Dr Baryomunsi that he did not understand what I said. (Laughter)

MR LUGOLOOBI: Madam Speaker, regarding the National Budget Framework Paper, the law requires the House to approve the Budget Framework Paper (BFP) before it leaves this House and indeed, the House approved the BFP for this medium-term. Based on that approval, we went ahead to prepare the policy statements. Now, there was no deadline as to when we should deliver or lay on the Table the final document incorporating the proposals from the House.

We are incorporating those recommendations into the final document, which we shall lay on the Table. We have been under pressure to make sure that we deliver the policy statements within the dictates of the law because we could not go beyond this day. It has been a lot of work since when the BFP was approved.

In the same vein, we are dealing with the Charter of Fiscal Responsibility to incorporate the new changes and we shall lay the final document on the Table in the very near future. Thank you so much.

MR MPUUGA: Madam Speaker, sometimes, we need to summon the humility to address gaps, when we are working. The finance minister is aware that there are three fundamental issues in laying any Budget documents and that the Budget must be aligned to the NDP, the Charter and the BFP.

So, without these in finality, what are the ministerial policy statements aligned to, Minister for Finance? If Parliament received, and through the committee, revised, advised and laid a document, the basic requirement is that you go and work on the parliamentary proposals and come up with a final document, which must anchor your policy statement. The committee handled the Charter. Before we know it, you are going to table the taxation Bills without a final Charter. 

Madam Speaker, the honourable minister should be humble and not take us into sentiments. We are dealing with a very serious procedural flaw. Let him talk about a remedy, before we handle the final Budget.

I do not really think that -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Actually, LOP, that is what he is saying; that he is going to lay the Charter. He accepts that there is a flaw - and he used to be the chairman of a very good committee; he was one of the best chairpersons. 

Honourable minister, you may need to lay the Charter and the revised BFP so that we can give them to the committees to harmonise with what has been sent to them. 

MR LUGOLOOBI: Madam Speaker, we shall lay it. In fact, we have to lay the final budget estimates by the 1st of April. Therefore, as we lay them, we shall make sure that they are accompanied by the BFP and the Charter of Fiscal Responsibility.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, Members. The ministerial statements are here; get them for your committees, look at them and harmonise them with the BFP and the revised fiscal charter that will come, and then you will have to report back to this House. 

Based on that, I adjourn the House sine die.

(The House rose at 2.50 p.m. and adjourned sine die.)
