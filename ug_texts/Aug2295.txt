The Council was called to order.


THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE AND ECONOMIC PLANNING (Mr Rukikaire):  Mr Chairman, I have the pleasure of laying before you two sets of reports, one is annual report of 1992/93 of the Bank of Uganda.   Secondly, I also would like to lay before you the Statutory Report to the National Resistance Council on implementation of provisions of PERD Statute No. 9, 1993 for the period during June 30th, 1995.


MINISTERIAL STATEMENT

MR RUKIKAIRE:  Mr Chairman, it has been my duty today to lay before the House the first statutory report on the implementation of the Public Enterprises Reform and Divestiture statute for the period ending June, 1995.  This is a statutory requirement.  As pointed out in the report which is being distributed and when you go out it should be in our pigeon holes, the delay to present this first report was because it took a long time to sort out various issues by government including putting in place a frame work for the implementation of the Presidential directive of January, 1995.  

Furthermore, I wanted to ensure that the views of the National Resistance Council expressed through the joint committees on the economy, parastatal accounts committee, under sectoral committee on finance and economic planning are fully reflected in this report.  With all the machinery now in place, I want to assure the House that the statutory requirement for a half yearly report is to be compiled with and the next will be ready for presentation to the House by 30th December 1995.  

I have no intention of repeating in this Ministerial Statement what is already contained in the report now before you.  I urge you to read it carefully we will welcome comments, suggestions and criticism upon which we will act so as to assist us in improving our performance and hopefully in presenting to you a better report in December this year.  We have of course gone a half way with privatisation exercise and 26 enterprises have so far been divested including liquidations and requisitions.  

The purpose of this Ministerial Statement is principally to announce to the hon. Members the intention of government to embark on a divestiture and reform programme that will introduce the system of public flotation of public companies for divestiture.  This will help us to reflect the letter and spirit of the PERD statute No. 9 of 1993, and will set the stage for broader participation for Ugandans from all walks of life and all levels of society rich or poor to participate in the ownership of these enterprises.  

Mr Chairman, hon. Members know that for the last nearly two and a half years, we have had with us the capital market authority bill aimed at creating a stock exchange mechanism through which shares can be plotted and traded.  Government had hoped that a stock exchange would have become operational by the beginning of this year.  Indeed a series of workshop seminars particularly involving stock blockers have already been organised in a preparation for the launching of a stock exchange operation.  

Regrettably, because this bill has remained with a National Resistance Council Committee longer than was envisaged, the bill has to date not yet been enacted into law, and it is hope that during this session, this Bill will law.  It is because of this delay that government now feels that divestiture of public companies through public flotation should be embarked upon without further delay.  Professional and technical expertise has been engaged by government to provide appropriate expertise in capital market flotation of companies as a to all the concerned parties.  

It is again not my intention to unnecessarily burden Members with details of how a public flotation is undertaken.  Suffice to say, it will require the involvement of different disciplines among which are stockbrokers, lawyers, accountants, valuers, bankers etc, all of them working together and cooperating.  Enterprises to be divested if they are not already so are to be turned into public liability companies and share values determined.  The actual process may be through share sales over the counter using selected commercial banks.  Discussions with the Bank of Uganda for the establishment of a trading room are already advanced and will be concluded soon.  

The principle element of this exercise is that the company to be divested must produce a prospector there after the shares are plotted and are available for purchase by the general public.  In this exercise where possible or necessary, government will invite strategic investors through competitive biding.  The role and scope of the strategic investor will be to ensure effective and better management of the enterprise.  It is hoped that the same investor will bring in new technology, new capital, access to market and better new work for output by the enterprise produces.  The strategic investor could be one or two or more provided, they have a shareholding that is able to influence the performance of that enterprise.  Control as you know hon. Members, does not necessarily require 51 per cent shareholding.  It could be less than 51 percent provided that the strategic investor remains the biggest shareholder able to handle the operations of the enterprise effectively, efficiently and decisively.  What is crucial is that a proportion of shares - and this is very important - is that a proportion of shares in these enterprises will be reserved for the Ugandan public and in case where the allotted shares are not taken up by the public immediately government would be prepared to retain those shares for a limited period to permit the Ugandan public to organise themselves so as to buy those shares. (Applause)  Such a delay, however, must be strictly limited.  

Furthermore, the core investor need not to be a foreigner and government will be hoping to see as many Ugandans as possible coming forward and taking up the challenge of becoming strategic investors in partnership with hundreds of thousands probably millions who will be taking up ordinary shares to purchase under the public flotation method.  Public participation may be singularly or severally so as to allow the smallest saver, investor, to have access to the share being put on the market.  There may be a need to have institution action on behalf of small savers such as associations, unit trusts, funds and so and so forth.  The public will have access to the shares on the market when prospectus and application forms are made available through the implementing agencies such as banks and other institutions to be identified.  

But let me emphasize that the whole system will be fully explained and publicised so as to leave no doubt whatsoever in the mind of a prospective share purchaser that the system is transparent, safe and secure.  To this effect, I wish to inform the House that government has hired a professional public relations firm with vast experience in Eastern Europe, that is America and Africa for disseminating appropriate information in a timely and targeted oriented manner to increase communication between implementing agencies and the public.  The existence of a solid strategic investor is one additional security for the small investor since clearly no large investor will wish to buy a majority share ownership and unless such an investor was certain of the viability and profitability of the enterprise.  

There have been arguments that public flotation cannot take place without a viable stock exchange.  We do not believe that this is done and public flotations are now accepted and are going on all the time in many countries around the world.  The existence of a stock exchange only facilitates trading after initial flotation of shares.  It is a necessary pre-condition.  Indeed some will argue that since capital market grows very slowly, it is preferable to run public flotations prior or side by side with a development of the stock exchange.  

It is the intention of government as provided in the statute to involve the boards, management and workers in this exercise and they will be encouraged to take up shares themselves under the system of public flotation when they are able.  It is indeed hoped that management and workers could themselves, resources permitting, become the strategic investors in some of these enterprises and go into partnership with the general public.  But let it be understood that no distortion of share prices will be entertained under any circumstances to favour any group of prospective share purchaser.  The integrity of the exercise will stand or fall on the ability of the system to maintain true market share prices and this principle will be the paramount corner stone of this exercise.  

The following companies are now being prepared for flotation to the public during the financial year 1995/96.  Coffee Marketing Board Limited, Foods and Beverages Company Ltd, Produce Marketing Board, Uganda Airlines, Uganda Consolidated properties Ltd and Uganda Grain Milling Company Ltd.  Other companies identified for possible flotation to the public at a later date include Kilembe Mines Ltd, I should say that, although we have partly divested the operation of Kilembe Mines, the Uganda Government is still a shareholder and therefore, it is possible that this remaining Uganda Government share holding could also be privatised through a process of flotation.  Kinyara Sugar Works Ltd, National Housing and Construction Cooperation, National Insurance Cooperation, New Vision Printing and Publishing Corporation -(Applause)- Steel Cooperation of East African Ltd., Uganda Clays Ltd., Uganda Diary Cooperation, Uganda Development bank, Uganda Pharmaceuticals Ltd.  You will note also from the report that, the public enterprises including the above which are insufficiently attractive for public plotation shall be widely advertised and sold by public auction or nay other suitable method.  

Those already identified for public auctions include Fresh Food, Gomba Motors, Water Crafts and Sales Company 1, Ltd., Paramount Manufacturers, that is the workshop, Republic Motors Ltd., Uganda Hire Purchase Ltd., Uganda Motors Limited. 

Finally, I want to say that, I have dealt at length with matters which are meant to enhance the achievement of the objectives in the statute provided by the House.  It is now absolutely necessary that we complete the divestiture exercise as soon as possible.  We need to focus on those matters that will move forward our country and create new wealth.  

You will be pleased to know that now there are considerable financial resources. For example, the investment term credit available in the banking system to support Uganda entrepreneurs in their new co-existing businesses.  We must therefore work towards relieving our energies and attention towards new investments and new priorities.  Hence, government will be looking forward to hon. Members’ cooperation in the programme of broadening share ownership of public enterprises.  Government is open to suggestions that will help to refine the progress this exercise forward for the well being of all our people.  I thank you, Mr Chairman

MR MWANDHA (Bugweri County, Iganga): I would like to thank the Minister and even congratulate him on giving - on laying on the Table the report which is supposed to do according to the law.  I think we shall be pleased to get it, read it, and subsequently perhaps discuss it.  But I listened carefully when the Minister was reading companies which are going to be privatised by flotation, I did not hear Uganda Commercial Bank, I did not hear Uganda Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, I did not hear UEB.  Would the Minister inform the House in which way he intends to privatise these companies?

MR RUKIKAIRE: Mr Chairman, the hon. Member who has asked this question is actually already free to get the information he is seeking now in this House because, I will discuss it with you.  But for the sake of other Members who may not know we have in the case UPTC already appointed and this announcement was also made through the Media IFC which is an international reputed company, to provide advisory services about the process of restructuring UPTC as well as advising government most specifically about its impending divestiture.  UPTC you will agree is a complex enterprise which requires quite a considerable amount of examination and it would not in order for government to prejudge the exact manner in which UPTC is going to be privatised when we have engaged competent professional services to help us during the exercise.  In the case of Uganda Commercial Bank, the position is largely retained be engaged and we called bids and we received bids from two prospective consultants to help us with the exercise, these bids have been evaluated by technical experts from the Bank of Uganda is under Commercial Bank, the treasury and the privatisation unit and we are awaiting reports to which we will make the final decision before we announce which merchant bank has selected to help us in the exercise of privatisation of UCB.  And, therefore, as in the case of Uganda Posts, it will be premature for me to tell you in exactly what manner we are going to carry out this exercise.  

But let me also make it clear here even for the public.  That should it become technically possible that some of the shares of these major enterprises can be plotted and the public participates in buying shares, government will be prepared to look at that option and indeed encourage their participation of share - ownership in these important enterprises.  But I would like to conclude by merely saying, this exercise is under way we have major and competent advisers and soon as possible the House and the public will be advising in what manner and way these two could be privatised.  Thank you.

MR LUBEGA:  I thank the Minister for the statement on public flotation, but as I do, I notice that there are a number of issues which must be articulated or addressed for instance, in his address in his statement the Minister states that we shall have such persons referred to as strategic investors.  He also points out that while the public processors are being carried out the portion of the shares will be either statutory or administratively preserved for the public.  Now given this set of things, I think it requires this House through one of its Committees and I would propose the Committee on Economy may be to be joined by the Committee on Finance to study the very details or even parastatal for that matter, so that they study the statements and the policy guidelines such as he has put out and advised the House more probably articulately so that the nation makes decisions which are very, very clear.  

I talked about a strategic investor.  Strategic investor could come and take up may be 30 percent or even over 50 percent of the shares in any certain venture for public cooperation.  While that strategic investor may have as a motive to maximise profits when some of these corporations, for instance, I can certainly refer to National Housing.  We have policies which take into consideration the question of housing people in different towns or areas of the country without necessarily maximising the profits.  So, this strategic investor could easily shift from these objectives and may be set up houses only in lucrative areas not minding certain other areas.  

Now, when you also talk about a portion of the shares to be reserved for the public.  Now, how big is the port, and the Minister has mentioned that if that portion of shares reserved for the public is not taken up then it could be also privatised through may be other than Ugandans.  This must be studied because the time frame work is not specified, we can say portion and after a certain period of time, what period of time is not specific.  That is why for these reasons I have given, I would propose that some our relevant Committees study this policy and advise the House more articulately.  Thank you.

MR RUKIKAIRE:  Mr Chairman, most certainly I think and the government as a whole will welcome contribution from Members whether through Committees or individuals to make comments of criticism or proposals - new proposals about how this exercise is to be undertaken.  Let me inform the House that my statement today is not just as a result of what I have sat down and conceived and brought here.  It is something that has been well and carefully considered for the last three months through dreecks established by the statute which was established by this House and in dreecks this having privileged to have the Chairman of the Committee of the Economy in forum and also the Chairman of the Committee on Parastatal Accounts Committee.  

So, the House is fully represented but in addition to that House was to have the Committees to meet and give us more comments and ideas about how it proceeds, then we will certainly welcome that advice also.  I, however, do not think that we should put a process which is already on going.  We have already identified these enterprises some of them are already advanced in being prepared for flotation, I am sure in another two three weeks we may announce a public flotation for one of the companies.  So, the exercise is already on going.  

In any case, what is important for the hon. Member is to know that this system should be welcomed by the House because whereas previously we have only been confining ourselves to selling these enterprises to single buyers 100 percent, we now have a sale dramatic important where many of them will have a core investor but in addition to him he will have the public taking up a considerable number of the shares.  I cannot tell you the exact proportion because no divestiture of one enterprise is ever the same like another one.  This one will be considered in the light of its position, in the light of its values, and in the light of what we think the strategic investor’s impact is likely to be.  so, in principle, I share your view and I accept that we will welcome as much advice from you as possible, either through the committees or through individuals but the exercise will be proceeding.

MR KANYOMOZI:  Mr Chairman, I would like to inform the House through you and the general public on concerns of hon. Damiano Lubega concerning the spread and also the interest of catering for those social objectives, should and can be catered for in the preparation of the memorandum and articles of association of the new organisation.  Secondly, you cannot put in the structure when you are plotting the company certain items both in the prospectus staging certain social objectives which must be achieved when the company is being sold.  I am here having in mind for example, if you are to plot UCB and you guess if we were to plot UCB or if we were to plot Uganda Electricity Board or if we were to plot Posts of if we were to plot National Housing, these corporations at the moment serve in addition to giving commercial fulfilling commercial objectives.  They serve certain social policy objectives.  For example, spread of electricity to rural areas.  Having branches in each of our district for commercial purposes - backs, having housing spread all over the country which the concern the hon. Member has just mentioned.  We can put in the articles and memorandums of association.  That provision that whoever finds these institutions has got to take that care.  Also, we can make a provision of having what they call a special share what in Britain they call a Golden share put in the agreement so that you ensure that if you are going to take over this company you will have to do xyv.  So, these can be done provided those who are going to negotiate these purchases -(Interjections)- sorry xyz -(Laughter)- provided those who are going to purchase these enterprises are aware of these conditions.  

Furthermore, provisions can be made that where these social objectives are beyond the commercial requirements and the profitability of the company, then the state should be obliged to take over these responsibilities or to have compensation to those institutions which buy.  But let me say as a point of information.  It helps that it moves away the idea which we have been most of us concerned with that a single buyers is the one who holds these institutions and the rest of us are kept out.  Thank you.

MR ELYAU:  Mr Chairman, I wanted to find out about the district inspectorate.  In fact, I am very interesting to see why the Inspector is not very active in the Local Administration.  Can the Minister tell us really where this is because Item 1060 traveling and transport of person in land.  Where do these people go to do inspection, and can I be informed really where this Inspectorate is being done because people are crying up-country when things go wrong.  If the inspectorate is really not active, can I be informed who are these people who go down to inspect?  Is it inside here of the Ministry or down to the districts?

MR BIDANDI SSALI:  Mr Chairman, with due respect to the hon. Member, I really do not comprehend the question.  The answer would be and is that they go to the district to inspect and my inspectorate has been doing that.

MR WANENDEYA:  The Minister of Local Government has informed us that the Inspectors go to districts to inspect.  May I inform the kind of inspections that are carried out.  The reason I say this, Mr Chairman, with all due respect is that, most of the 50 percent which is collected to go back or to stay at RC.II and III are just swindled and there are no accounts here.  Could he tell us what goes on and could he avail accounts of every district per sub-county so that we know that this money has been accounted for.  The point why I say this is that, you go in our villages despite the fact that we pay the 50 per cent remains behind this is not done and even has got an organisation to do the inspection otherwise that money I do not see why it should be left behind when it is all swindled up.  I thank you.

MR BIDANDI SSALI:  Mr Chairman, under the Local Government Statute which was passed by hon. Members here, there is a clear procedure laid down for inspecting the accounts at the local level of RC.II and III which the hon. Member is talking about.  The inspectorate of the Ministry is mainly at the district level and there is a statutory provision for inspecting the lower levels of local governments.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.

MR WASSWA NKARUBO:  Mr Chairman, Programme 06: The Resistance Council.  Some time back, the government came out with a policy that it will be paying the RCs at the lower levels.  I would request the Minister to tell the House whether this one - this amount is earmarked for the payment of these RCs at the lower level if not, he can tell this House how we are going to remunerate these RCs because it came out as a policy of the government that we should be paying them, but I do not see any amount.  If this is the amount I see two minimal of 7 million shillings, it is snot worthy to putting in the budget may be the Minister should explain to the Chairman, it is therefore, either the Chairman can tell us whether that is a token sum or we have some other estimates to cater for the RCs from RC.1, II, III, IV, which are actually involved in the day running of these RCs.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.

MR BIDANDI SSALI:  Mr Chairman, I think the provision here is for the RC department in my Ministry.  As far as the payment of the RCs at the lower level is concerned, the 50 percent which is supposed to remain at the RC III part of it in fact, 10 percent go to the RC IV, 25 percent of what remains goes to the RC I and part of it remains at the RC II.  Now, at the RC II part of that is supposed to be allowances to the RCs at that level and so is what goes to the RC I.  This was the arrangement we thought would be practicable and convenient.  Because in the past we tried a number of times to provide for the payment of all the RCs and the exercise -(Interjections)- because of the magnitude of the amount involved.  That is why this particular system of 50 percent which remains at the RC III and then to ascend downs to the RC I and to the RC IV contains an element of reasonable amount which should be paid to the RCs at those levels as allowances.

Programme 07

MR ELYAU:  Mr Chairman, I want to find out about the 100 million which is put at Item No.3030 on material supply to manufacture goods.  I wanted to find out from the minister some of our local police to go with plain clothes; it is very difficult to identify them.  May I know whether these uniforms go to the local administration down there?  Because, it has been very difficult for us in areas like Soroti to find a local police well dressed to the maximum as it used to be, can I find whether this is going to help them to get these uniforms?  

MR BIDANDI SSALI:  Mr Chairman, I got this very question in the Sectoral Committee and I explained it very well, and I said, in fact, in effect to the question he was asking the answer is yes.  This is the money going to buy these manufactured belts; I do not know what you call them.  This is the money, Mr Chairman.

AN HON. MEMBER:  Mr Chairman, I am worried about specialised services that have gone to the Ministry of Local Government.  I give an example; the directorate of Water Development had been running urban water services in Kisoro town for instance.  I understand this one has now been decentralised to the Ministry of Local Government.  I did not see under the decentralisation secretariat adequate provisions to look after Kisoro water plan.  May I be given an assurance.

MR BIDANDI SSALI:  Mr Chairman, first of all, it is wrong to say something has been decentralised to the Ministry of Local Government, because Ministry of Local Government is part of the centre.  That is one aspect, the second aspect is that, the best of my knowledge, this water the hon. Member is quoting is not part of the decentralised service, and lastly, all services that have been decentralised are taken care of through a block grant.  So, in most cases, we will not see the individual items provided for here.  In short, I am saying this particular case the hon. Member is quoting is not one of those services that have been decentralised.

THE CHAIRMAN:  I now put the question that a total sum of UShs 1,992,662,000- under Vote 025 - Ministry of Local Government be provided for.

PROJECT NAME:  PRE-URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT

MR OBWANGOR:  Mr Chairman, I think I would like to ask the Minister of Local Government how active really he is to ensure that the Local Municipalities are working particularly in relation to their direct labour which is kept idle by the time the Permanent Secretary goes round the town to get the money for themselves, and not even to sit in places/market for selling food. I am sure my Colleague who comes from the Municipality, I come from Soroti Municipality and I really adore Soroti Municipality but it is hopeless the Minister comes there, when he comes there when we should address him, he comes to Grace Akello during the night. (Laughter)  And then on Saturdays, when nobody in Soroti Municipality would be in a position to attend meetings, the Minister for Local Government comes to Grace Akello, I repeat purposely -(Interruption)

MR ELYAU:  Point of information.  It is not true that the Minister comes in that occasion where hon. Obwangor is referring this House. Akello has had a meeting in Kaberamaido and also a meeting in Atuboi, so they delayed to address the people not just that the Minister wanted to come late to Soroti.

MR OBWANGOR:  Mr Chairman, I have nothing to do to my Colleague hon. Elyau, I am not misleading, I control Soroti because I am the key -(Laughter)- but what we want is, we want just something for our people, we want just services for our people.  We want inspection to make the town clerk effective, the engineer effective to keep the town clean.  I am sure when the things are being organised -(Interruptions)

MR BIDANDI SSALI:  Mr Chairman, this is one of those occasions which illustrate a problem of some of us who have been on scene for sometime, we still live in the past believing that I as Bidandi or hon. Obwangor, as him must be the one through whom you must pass if you want to go to Soroti or if you want to go whatever area one may talk about.  Simply because I did not, and I repeat, I did not go through hon. Obwangor but went on the invitation the Sectoral commission to go around the whole of Teso spending two days in Kumi and three days in Soroti then hon. Obwangor offence and in fact, went ahead to say, who is this girl and he said Grace Akello to invite a whole Minister without my knowledge.  I would like to inform you, Mr Chairman, that my tour of Teso early this year was organised by the Teso Commission in collaboration with the office of the CGR, in collaboration with my office, the district executive office and it lasted five days when I visited all the counties except two Teso areas.  

Two, I would like to inform the hon. Member through you, Mr Chairman, that the essence of decentralisation today is that the responsibility is no longer that of the Minister of Local Government.  In fact, right from the town clerk to the town engineer he is talking about; the responsibility now is with in the District Service Committee.  If you find the clerk not measuring the task please open the key to the town council, the Municipal Council there are so that they can discuss whether the town clerk is the right person or not, and if they find he is not, they can make the recommendation to the District Service Committee to change the staff as they wish.  I no longer as Minister of Local Government appoint town clerks anywhere except, the City of Kampala until most probably Friday or no until promulgation of the new Constitution.  It is the only town clerk who is still under the Central Government and this is because the city is equivalent to a district.  Otherwise, all other urban areas, it is the District Service Committee which has got to tress all the members of staff.  Thank you very much.

MR WANENDEYA:  Mr Chairman, I am referring to consultant 221, you should look under that and under micro-project Urban and Small Scale Industries.  If you look through the series for consultants is just too much, I just wonder whether there is a procedure which is followed in getting consultants.  Because although I was not given the opportunity to comment, but in some cases, the amount of money for consultants is more than the project itself.  So, could the Minister inform us the procedures taken in recruiting consultants?  Because, I remember hon. Rwakakooko at one time here deceived for consultant is the biggest burden for our country and for our economy, especially when we have got to borrow this money from overseas.  Thank you.

MR BIDANDI SSALI:  Mr Chairman, I will answer this in general terms by saying that some of these projects are grant money where we are required to make a small contribution in relation to the total value of the project, and merge all what is contained, for example, on consultancy; is an inherent part of the grant and our role here is really to approve the suitability of the consultant concerned, and not the levels of payment because they are already part of the grant and more or less a conditionality of the grant.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.


REHABILITATION, MAINTENANCE OF RURAL FEEDER ROADS (IFAD)

MR OBWANGOR:  Mr Chairman, I would like the Minister of Local Government to ensure that the feeder roads in the rural areas are effectively done.  We need effective supervision, ‘bannampala’ to see that the work is really done, not just -(Interjection)- but we are wasting money here, because the money there is not controlled, is just poured out, no work!  We want these gang men to be given piecework. (Interruption)

AN HON. MEMBER:  Point of information.  Mr Chairman, I thought hon. Obwangor knows that the district have been decentralised, the Ministry of Local Government has nothing to do with the repair of the roads in rural areas; I think he should understand this.  

MR OBWANGOR:  The overall view of Local Government does not at all control; it gives money to the Central Government and it is controlled; to see that it done for the common welfare and common building of the rural areas.  Therefore, what I am praying is this, we should not pass in this House money to be wasted without production.  We should see the feeder roads really to be effective to ensure rural people to bring their goods and produce - their products to be brought to the markets; not to be put them in because the so-called money has been voted by Parliament here- and we are responsible, that money was passed by Parliament here but no work done.

MR BIDANDI SSALI:  Mr Chairman, I have taken careful note of the advice. (Laughter)

THE CHAIRMAN:  I now put the question that the total sum of UShs 8,283,900,000- under Head 125 - Ministry of Local Government be provided for.

MR OBWANGOR:  Mr Chairman, I am entitled to be sure that the House, particularly the leaders of this House, the Public Service, in order that these people are made to work effectively for the good of the nation.  Now, politically and under the Parliamentary procedure, I would like to move a Motion that UShs 12 million be deducted from this account to enable to speak about the. Because, we politicians in this House, our partners in development administration of this country are civil servants!  We should not be making the civil servants slaves in their own country!  We are not paying them on time -(Interruption)

MR RWAKAKOOKO:  Point of clarification.  I think we have now reached Vote 027  which specifically is Public Service Commission.  I pick the impression he was referring to Public Service which is a different Vote.  Can I get the clarification from him?  Is he talking about Civil Public Service, is he talking about Public Service Commission?

VOTE 064 - BUSHENYI DISTRICT

Programme 05

DR TIBERONDWA:  I would like to ask the Minister to tell this House whether in view of the fact that what used to be called the Bushenyi Town Council now includes Ishaka and the area is much bigger than the areas which have been promoted - to the Municipality; whether the Minister has in mid an idea of promoting Ishaka Town council to the status of Municipality, because it is now bigger than some of the Municipalities in the country.

MR BIDANDI SSALI:  Mr Chairman, I have in my office presentations to this effect and I have set the process of investigation in place.  As you know, I as Minister of Local Government, do not have powers to declare any area as a Municipality because of the fact that the moment I do that, I will have automatically qualified that area to representation in this House.  So, once you have done the homework, I present the matter to Cabinet and from Cabinet to this House and finally, it is this House which has got to take the final decision.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.

VOTE 076 - SOROTI DISTRICT

(Question proposed.)

Programme 01

MR ELYAU:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  May I know from the Minister - the salaries for - I mean the chiefs who were retrenched or sent away during the -(Inaudible)- there has been a complain that they had asked the Minister to consider about UShs 300 million to meet the expense; I do not know whether this amount here for staff includes the amount which we had requested so that that quarrel is settled; people are complaining chiefs were not paid up to today.  Can I get the information?

MR OBWANGOR:  Mr Chairman, may I be clearly informed by the hon. Minister for Local Government when he talks of a new vote whether that includes - in case of Vote 076 under debate now, or whether it includes Soroti Municipality?

MR BIDANDI SSALI:  Mr Chairman, the payment of members of staff who were retrenched is a responsibility of the district.  But during the Budget, we put special presentation to the Ministry of Finance for Soroti and Kumi, Kotido and Moroto; unfortunately, we were informed to wait until time for supplementary estimates.  So, it is not included in here.  We just took it as a special assistance to these particular areas because of the problems they went through.  As regards the second question of hon. Obwangor, the answer is yes; it is part of this particular vote.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.

THE CHAIRMAN:  I now put the question that the total sum of UShs 4,280,774,000 - under Vote 076 of Soroti District be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to.)

VOTE 077 - KALANGALA DISTRICT

(Question proposed.)

Programme 03

MR MUTEBI MULWANIRA:  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman.  I am glad that as for Kalangala you have not got funds for decentralised activity, and we have been broken down Item by Item.  I would like to ask the hon. Minister whether he perceives that Programme 3 of 1.152 can work on the district agriculture extension programme, considering that Kalangala is divesting from fishing as the main economic activity.  Because my district agricultural officer is already complaining whether he is staying in the district or not.  This gives him only hardly UShs 100,000/- per month to run his staff.  Is this going to be revisited, hon. Minister?

MR MAYENGO:  Mr Chairman, I almost have a question on every programme.  What we have got here are more pages than any other district, and generally nothing else.  It is ridiculous.  On programme 03, I would like to know from the Minister whether in this agricultural extension programme he is including the problem of water hyacinth which is part of our fishing, and to my understanding agriculture in the Ministry means fishing included.

MR BIDANDI SSALI:  Mr Chairman, if I may start with the last question, the answer is ‘no’, it is not included because the problem is a national one, it is not a Kalangala problem.  With regard to the question from my Colleague, I would like to explain that Kalangala is still on the vote system that is we are not yet to a level of obtaining block grants; we are one of the last batches of 13.  Two, what is reflected here is, what the government or the Ministry of Agriculture has been expending in the district directly from them.  But now that there is this decentralisation, instead of using that money as they have been using, we now send directly to the district.  I am not in a position to answer the basis of this particular figure as regards agricultural extension.  But I am sure it falls within the general formula whereby may be the size of the district, the size of the population, the extent of the agricultural extension involved play a very important role.  In other words, I am saying that my Colleague could pursue it from the relevant Ministry; but for the purpose of the budget he got what he was entitled to according to the national formula.  Thank you very much.

Programme 06

MR MAYENGO:  On Programme 06, Mr Chairman, I notice one million shillings for secondary education in the entire district which produces probably more than most of these districts.  Just to sort of prove my last statement, the production; you can imagine that last week one fish factory only based in Entebbe is expecting to export 50 tonnes of fish per day, and that taken at a cost of 3 dollars per kilogramme, is 150,000 dollars per day - I mean 150 million shillings per day!  Now, can you imagine a million shillings for the entire secondary education.  What is in the mind of the Minister?

MR BIDANDI SSALI:  Mr Chairman, I know this is a provision for a special case, in case of Kalangala, but the provision for secondary education is within the Ministry of Education, because secondary education as per today is not a decentralised service.

MR MAYENGO:  Special provision, what for?  Is it for entertaining teachers, is it for providing them with bicycles, what exactly is it?  

MR BIDANDI SSALI:  Mr Chairman, I would like to beg the hon. Member who has put this question to give me time so that I could give him the exact explanation; but let him be assured that this figure does not stand for the government’s spending on secondary education in Kalangala District.

THE CHAIRMAN:  I now put the question that the total sum of UShs 276,690,000 under Vote 077 of Kalangala District be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to.)

VOTE 078 - KIBALE DISTRICT

(Question proposed.)

Programme 01

MR RWAKAKOOKO:  Mr Chairman, I want to ask a general question which may run through this programme, in order to avoid having to ask many times.  Kibale District is one of the very young districts and I can recall straight away these other districts like Ntungamo and Pallisa and a few others; These districts have been caught up by the system of decentralisation before they build some reasonable capacity to undertake the programmes necessary on their own with substantial contribution.  I want to find out from the Minister if there is any special consideration which may be made for them, bearing in mind that there are no claims which they have made on the older districts.  

I am using the example of Ntungamo which the Minister knows very well.  when Ntungamo became a district the salaries of workers in the district had not been paid for by Mbarara District, and Mbarara District took registers and they defied the Minister’s directive to, actually, return the registers.  Now, I am sure this case applies to this young district, is there any special consideration which may be put in place to at least, assist them in the form of institutional ‘Entandiikwa’ so that these districts can be assisted, Mr Chairman?

MR SIBO:  Mr Chairman, you will remember that in the recommendations we made, and these recommendations were proved by this House, we included an amount of money for ‘Entandiikwa’ for these young districts the amount was calculated to be UShs 850 million; unfortunately, this has not been included in the present budget, but it is one of those that will probably come forward under the supplementary requirement.  

THE CHAIRMAN:  I now put the question that the total sum of UShs 1,713,212,000- under Vote 078 of Kibale District be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to.)
