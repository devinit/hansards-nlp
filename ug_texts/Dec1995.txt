(The House was called to order)


THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  Order, hon. Members, as you can see, there is no quorum and these have been unfortunate events in this Parliament.   I regret that.    And with that, I will adjourn the Council sine die and, therefore, we come to the end of today’s business.  Thank you.

(The Council rose at 2.45 p.m. and adjourned sine die.)
