BILLS
SECOND READING
THE SALARIES AND ALLOWANCES SPECIFIED OFFICERS' BILL,1999

THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC SERVICE (Mr. Amanya Mushega): Thank you Mr. Speaker.  Arising from the number of changes we made to the bill -

MR. DICK NYAI: Point of order. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise on a point of order. Whereas I understand and completely agree with you to call on the Minister of Public Service to ask for the bill's Second Reading, Mr. Speaker, this bill intends to create charges on the public fund, and that to me makes it a very important bill.  In view of the gravity of this matter -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Member, I did not call the Minister to move for the Second Reading. I asked if he has anything to say. I think we would rather listen to that, and then we can come to that.

MR. DICK NYAI: I am much obliged.

MR. AMANYA MUSHEGA: I thank you very much Mr. Speaker, and I hope my old Friend Dick Nyai in future learns to answer after he has been asked and to comment on what has been presented.  

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: That was a friendly chat I think. We leave that as that.

MR. AMANYA MUSHEGA: Thank you, sir.  Patience is a virtue. In light of what have been the major alterations we have carried out, I would like to request you, sir, that you give me up to Monday to make some wider consultations, consult other stakeholders so that we are agreeable on the number of alterations we are to make at the committee stage, sir. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay, I think this matter then will come up on Tuesday.

CONSIDERATION OF THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL ECONOMY ON THE CLOSURE OF THE COOPERATIVE BANK.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I see that the Chairperson of the Committee which presented the report, hon. Musumba, is not here. In view of that, I think it is not fair to carry out the anticipated debate on this report and therefore the matter will be dealt with on Monday at 2.00 p.m. The House is adjourned until Monday at 2.00 p.m.

(Parliament rose and adjourned until Monday 3rd August, 1999 at 2.00 p.m.)
