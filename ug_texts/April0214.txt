MS KIIZA: I want to thank you, Mr Speaker, and once again call upon my committee to be on the lookout, the work is just too much for us but we have to do it. We are ready for the task and we shall ensure service delivery is done to the population and that the money sent by the Central Government to the local governments is sufficiently utilised and accounted for. I thank you, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Is that an assurance? (Laughter)

MS KIIZA: It is our work as a committee, Mr Speaker. So we have to do it.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. Let all those financial statements, reports and opinions of the Auditor-General for periods ending 30 June 2011 and some ending 30 June 2012 covering district local government accounts, municipal council accounts, town council accounts and sub-county accounts, be committed to the committee on local government accounts for expeditious handling and reporting within the timeframe provided within the rules. 

Of course, we talked about backlog yesterday and I have an undertaking from the chairperson stating that they will work hard to clear that backlog and also deal with these new issue that have just come. Thank you very much, next item.

PRIME MINISTER’S QUESTION TIME

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Chief whip, are we expecting the Prime Minister?

2.28
THE GOVERNMENT CHIEF WHIP (Ms Kasule Lumumba): Mr Speaker, I am sorry we have ended late but the Prime Minister is coming. I suggest we move to another item. That is my prayer.

MINISTERIAL STATEMENT

2.29
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR WATER AND ENVIRONMENT (ENVIRONMENT) (Ms Flavia Nabugere): Mr Speaker, I was meant to present a paper on the degradation of Kinawataka but I beg to request that this paper be deferred and the reason is that it relates to another paper that is pending before Cabinet, which paper will form part of it. I request therefore that it be set on the Order Paper for Thursday, 10 April 2014.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, hon. Minister. I do not know what has happened because you are the one who pushed us to put this statement on the Order Paper but since there are those developments, please come back on Thursday next week to finalise with this statement. 

 MRS OGWAL: For purposes of the record, we would like to know whether the minister is bringing us a paper for presentation or a ministerial statement?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The minister is coming with what this House understands - (Laughter) - She will not come with something that this House does not understand.

MRS OGWAL: Can the minister stick to the rules? Thank you.

MS LUMUMBA: Mr Speaker, after our discussion on this issue yesterday -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Which issue?

MS LUMUMBA: The issue on the impending impeachment of the Rt Hon. Margaret Zziwa, Speaker of the East African Legislative Assembly. Yesterday after the discussion of this issue, I got in touch with the Minister in charge of the East African Community Affairs and he informed me that the House had adjourned sine die. So, I pray that we let the minister come and make a substantive statement next week since now he has the time to come and give us an update. He is on the way travelling back.

I also request that since this matter also concerns Parliament and the Members representing Uganda will also be travelling back, that these Members come to the committee. This is because we received information yesterday that they have not been coming to the committee. These Members should also come so that the committee does its work, gives a report and the Executive gives a report next week.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much. Hon. Members, that is the situation. There were developments in Arusha yesterday but hon. Members, I would like to inform the House that after yesterday, I went and looked at the Treaty again as well as our Rules of Procedure and there seems to be some disharmony between the two instruments, which we will need time to harmonise.

The Treaty does not recognise any parliamentary committee. The Treaty does not communicate with any other institution in Parliament except the Office of the Clerk. The Clerk of that Assembly communicates directly with the Clerk of this Assembly and nobody else. It is the Minister responsible for East African Community Affairs who can access this House directly and give this information. So, we might have to find time to fine tune this. 

As to whether that committee can summon the members of the East African Legislative Assembly, it is not even in the Treaty. So we might have to find a way of harmonising these situations. In the Treaty it is up to the members, if the members feel they want to come and engage with the committee, then they can do so. So, we might have to find time to see how to harmonise this. 

MOTION FOR THE PRESENTATION, CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE SECTORAL COMMITTEE ON HEALTH ON THE PETITION BY THE MEMBERS OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY OF UGANDA

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Chairperson, Committee on Health, is the report ready? Is there a member ready to present this report? I have always thought hon. Dr Sam Lyomoki Wanzige was very responsible for this sector but I see him - you are not there now? Okay. Is there any member of the committee who can present this report of the Committee on Health? It is a petition from the Pharmaceutical Society of Uganda. Next item.

MOTION FOR THE PRESENTATION, CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE SECTORAL COMMITTEE ON HEALTH ON THE PETITION BY CHILDREN LIVING WITH SPINA BIFIDA

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Members, chairperson or any member. Hon. Members, I received this petition personally first outside Parliament and then secondly within the precincts of Parliament. The matters are urgent. Is the chairperson ready because they told us they were ready and that is why the matter is on the Order Paper? Is the committee ready? Yes, the Leader of the Opposition.

2.38
THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Mr Phillip Wafula Oguttu): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am a bit disturbed with the way we are proceeding because the government and the chairpersons do not seem to be taking the work of Parliament seriously. We had a very nice leadership meeting in Entebbe last weekend and we talked about our work ethics but the way things are going - I do not think we should proceed this way and I do not think we are giving value for money to our electorate and the taxpayers of this country. Mr Speaker, I would like you to pronounce yourself on this matter. We cannot just go on in this way and carry out business as usual.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: We still have two other items from the same then I will make a statement after that. Next item.

MOTION FOR THE PRESENTATION, CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE SECTORAL COMMITTEE ON HEALTH ON THE OUTBREAK OF HEPATITIS B IN ADJUMANI AND MOYO DISTRICTS

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Chairperson, Health Committee or any member of this committee who is ready. Next item.

MOTION FOR THE PRESENTATION, CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE SECTORAL COMMITTEE ON HEALTH ON ITS FINDINGS FROM ITS OVERSIGHT FIELD VISITS TO LIRA, OYAM AND GULU DISTRICTS

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Chairperson? Any Members? Hon. Members, is there any member of this committee in this Committee on Health? Can we hear what is happening with these reports? Do you have information?

MS KAMATEEKA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Order Paper came out late today and so it is possible that the -

THE DEPUTY SEPAKER: No, these issues were on the Order Paper yesterday. Please give us information that is correct. This was business that was for yesterday, they only rolled out to today. Please. Member for Gulu.

MS AOL: Thank you, Mr Speaker. We were in a meeting and I expected my chairperson and the Vice-Chairperson to be here to present the reports of the Health committee. I am a member of the Health committee and we have done our best in the committee. It is now the chairperson or the Vice-Chairperson to present. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Do we have copies of the reports? Were these reports actually ready?

MR REAGAN OKUMU: Mr Speaker, this is a very serious issue. Sanctions should be given to chairpersons and their deputies who do not care to delegate responsibilities to members because I assume the two members who stood up are actually not aware of where the chairpersons are. They are not even knowledgeable as to whether the committee reports are ready or not.  This is very bad for Parliament. 

I would like to appeal to the whips to take up this matter very seriously and impose sanctions on chairpersons and their deputies who are unable to even communicate earlier before the Order Paper comes out because once something has come on the Order Paper, it is expected that the clerk of the committee has informed the relevant members and chairperson to be present. Nothing can just appear on the Order Paper without the knowledge of the committee membership. I find this extremely unacceptable, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let me hear from the Member for Bukoto.

MS FLORENCE NAMAYANJA: Thank you very much. Last weekend we had a very useful workshop in Entebbe and it was intended to improve on the quality of the business in this House. Mr Speaker, I would like to find out how business comes up to the Order Paper and whether by the time business comes to the Order Paper, the committee and Members are aware because we have had instances where if the chairperson and the deputy are not around, communication is sent to the Office of the Speaker and members are in position to present and defend the committee business. This is an embarrassment to the entire Parliament because from the items that are on the Order Paper that we have seen today, most of the people responsible to present these items are absent and there is no reason being advanced. I need to be guided on how business arrives on the Order Paper.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I would like to hear from Members of this committee. This is not a matter that is for substantial debate. It is a matter of great concern and I would like Members of the committee to speak.

HON. MEMBERS: Where are they?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: There is no a single Member of this committee?

2.41
MS JUSTINE KHAINZA (NRM, Woman Representative, Bududa): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to pass on the apologies of our committee Members. Actually our reports are ready but the committee chairperson is still organising and trying to get some hard copies for Members. The soft copies are already sent and if Members check their ipads, they already have the soft copies but the chairperson is on the way coming.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Where is the chairperson?

MS KHAINZA: In five minutes he will be in. Let me just go and – even the vice-chairperson is outside. Let me go and cross check with them but the reports are actually ready. Let me get you a copy – let me get my ipad.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Then proceed and present.

MS KHAINZA: I will need five minutes to organise myself to open the ipad and then I come.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: If you were part of this report, please proceed and present. Okay, Chief Whip.

2.42
THE GOVERNMENT CHIEF WHIP (Ms Justine Kasule Lumumba): Mr Speaker, this is a very serious matter and it puts us in bad light as an institution and Government. Mr Speaker, the Speaker ruled here thrice that all the pending business will be put on the Order Paper and every committee should be ready. So, no committee should have an excuse to go against the Speaker’s ruling.

Secondly, with the coming of the ipads, the Order Paper comes on the website in time for any Member of Parliament to access it and so nobody should have an excuse.

Thirdly, when the Order Paper is out, the Chief Whip’s Office rings responsible committee leadership whether NRM or the Opposition and also rings the minister in charge of that sector. We have done our part and what remains is for the committee.

Mr Speaker, I also want to suggest that we should also have in our rules a rule to discipline chairpersons because their actions also have an impact on the performance of this institution and we are accountable to the people we lead. 

Lastly, this is an issue of the Parliamentary Commission but I want to raise it. Some of the Members especially leaders of committees on both sides - whether Government or the Opposition - whenever the Chief Whip raises them on issues to do with the committee, they feel that the Executive is interfering in the work of Parliament. The Office of the Chief Whip is an office of Parliament that is supposed to play a coordination role but when it is purely put under the Executive, Members do not get the sense of belonging and that is why they get that attitude. So, we may have to work on this but also correct some other issues.

Lastly and I repeat, we should also have in our rules how to discipline chairpersons who do not want to keep time to save the face of the institution. I thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much, Chief Government Whip.  The situation of seconding chairpersons of committees must be reviewed. The issue of nominating chairpersons should be reviewed because it is becoming counterproductive. The committee chairpersons, like it was in the Seventh Parliament were elected by the members of the committee. We cannot go on like this, really. When you are elected by the members of the committee, you owe responsibility to the members of the committee. It may work better and we may have to review all these things. 

Is that the chairperson of the Committee on Health? Mr Chairperson, you have to start by giving an apology to this House, please.    

2.46
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON HEALTH (Dr Kenneth Omona): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me begin with exactly what you have just said and there is nothing good that I may say other than apologise. I take my commitment and designation as chairperson of the committee also very seriously. There is not in any way that I will ever intentionally let down my committee or the work of Parliament.

Mr Speaker, as you may recall, not long ago when backlog in committees was mentioned by the then sitting Speaker, I have been trying my level best as chairperson of this committee to produce these many reports that we now see on the Order Paper. Indeed, the whole of last week, I was in this House waiting to present these reports and today, I was around early enough to present these reports. I have only been asked by an honourable colleague in this House who has had a group of charity organisations from Europe - in fact, she got me on the steps and begged me to listen to this group of people –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Member, we do not have any more time to deal with this. Please, call item six.

DR OMONA: Mr Speaker, I am indeed very sorry if this has caused inconvenience to this House.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Item six.

MOTION FOR THE PRESENTATION, CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE SECTORAL COMMITTEE ON HEALTH ON THE PETITION BY THE MEMBERS OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY OF UGANDA

2.49
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON HEALTH (Dr Kenneth Omona): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I come to present to the House a report of the Committee on Health on the petition by the new members of the Pharmaceutical Society of Uganda and I wish to lay a copy of the report on Table. I beg to lay. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let the records capture the full text of the report.

(Full report to appear in the monthly Hansard bound volume of April 2014.)

DR OMONA: Mr Speaker, on 3 July 2012, hon. Alice Alaso presented a petition to this House on behalf of the new graduates of pharmacy from various universities inside and outside Uganda. The main complaint of the petitioners was that they had obtained academic credentials and other prescribed requirements but the efforts to be registered by the Pharmacy Board had been frustrated. And without being registered by the Pharmacy Board, they could not practise pharmacy in Uganda. Without practising, they missed an income. 

In addition, the health sector was robbed of energetic, qualified and technical personnel. The petitioners had made several pleas to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health, the Director-General of Health Services and the Registrar of the Pharmacy department of the Ministry of Health but all in vain. The petition was referred to the Committee on Health for consideration.

The prayers of the petitioners were that: “ 
    (1) The Registrar of the Pharmacy Department in the Ministry of Health register the petitioners immediately as qualified pharmacists in Uganda;
    (2) The Ministry of Health compensate the petitioners for having delayed to register and hence cause them financial loss.”

Mr Speaker, in our line of inquiry, we embarked on the assignment and we were guided by the following questions:
    (i) We wanted to find out who was responsible for registering the qualified pharmacists before they could practise the professions.
    (ii) Why did the responsible officer refuse to the register the petitioners as qualified pharmacists?
    (iii) Did the responsible officer deliberately refuse to register the new pharmacists or was it due to reasons beyond their control?

Mr Speaker, the source of information this committee relied on to compile the report were based on the text of the petitioners, witnesses and then the relevant laws that the committee reviewed. 

The committee interacted with the Minister of State for Health, the Director-General of Health Service, the Registrar of the Pharmacy Board and the relevant laws which included the Pharmacy and Drug Act, the National Drug Policy Act and the National Medical Stores Act.

Findings about the process of registration of pharmacists in Uganda

The registration of pharmacists is governed by the Pharmacy and Drug Act. An applicant for registration must first apply to the Pharmaceutical Society of Uganda, an association of pharmacists. According to Section 6(2) of the Pharmacy and Drug Act, the society is a body corporate. The applicant sits a qualifying examination by the society and after passing the examination, pays a prescribed fee as membership fee. He or she is recommended by the society to the Pharmacy Board. Once the board is satisfied with the credentials, the Registrar of the Pharmacy Board, upon the directive of the board on the payment of the registration fee, enters the name of the applicant to the register and issues the application a certificate of registration in the prescribed form. From that point the pharmacist is eligible to practise his or her profession.

Mr Speaker, we found the inactivity of this board, which has been there – in fact the board has been inactive for 17 years. The committee was informed that from 1993 to February 2012, the Pharmacy Board was dormant. The reason for the dormancy was mainly due to two developments; first was the enactment of the National Drug Policy and Authority Act in 1993. 

The committee was informed by the Ministry of Health that with the enactment of the National Drug Policy and Authority Act, the functions of the Pharmacy Board that deal with ensuring the availability of efficacious and cost-effective essential medicines at all times to Ugandans were transferred to the National Drug Authority Board. In effect, the submission by the Ministry of Health was that the transfer of the critical functions of the Pharmacy Board to the NDA board largely made the Pharmacy Board redundant.

However, the committee examined the two laws namely, the Pharmacy and Drug Act, 1970 and the National Drug Policy and Authority Act, 1993. It found that the submission by the Ministry of Health was not actually factual. First of all, it was not true that the Pharmacy Board created by section 1 of the Pharmacy and Drug Act, 1970 is mandated to ensure the availability of safe, efficacious and cost-effective essential medicines at all times to Ugandans. 

The National Drug Authority Board, established under section 3 of the National Drug Policy and Authority Act is enjoined to, among other functions, deal with the development and regulation of the pharmacies and drugs in the country. Could it be that the Ministry of Health construed this function to encompass the registration of pharmacies? Of course that view would be wrong and illegal as regulation of pharmacies is different from the registration of pharmacies. Therefore, the two bodies, namely the NDA Board that regulates pharmacies and the Pharmacy Board that registers pharmacies are separate and different.

The second explanation was that the Public Service restructuring that was undertaken since 1990 abolished posts of chief medical officer and chief pharmacist yet these were the pillars of the Pharmacy Board. It is important to note that the Pharmacy Board, established under Section 1 of the Pharmacy and Drugs Act consists of the Chief Medical Officer who shall be the chairperson, the chief pharmacist who shall be the registrar of the board and an advocate, two medical practitioners, a veterinary surgeon and four pharmacists all appointed by the Minister of Health.

Mr Speaker, according to the submission by the Ministry of Health, with the abolition of the two vital posts of the chief medical officer and chief pharmacist, the Pharmacy Board could not function since it would not have a chairperson and registrar. 

The committee, therefore, observed that there was uncoordinated restructuring of the Public Service that led to the abolition of critical offices. However, the committee noted the lack of vigilance of the Ministry of Health, which led to its failure to bring to the attention of the Ministry of Public Service and the Uganda Law Reform Commission the implication of the abolition of the posts of the chief medical officer and chief pharmacist on the operation of the Pharmacy Board.

Mr Speaker, in the administrative attempt to address the lacuna, the committee was informed that in order to address the registration needs of qualifying pharmacists the Minister put in place an administrative body named the pharmacy council to register the applicants and issue them with some form of registration certificates. 
At the time the Pharmacy Board remained in abeyance, the Pharmaceutical Society of Uganda, an association of pharmacists continued to issue enrolled certificates to the newly qualified pharmacists which were taken to be a certificate of practice that the pharmacists could use to practise pharmacy in Uganda.

When the administrative arrangement to issue practicing certificates was put in place, some practising pharmacists applied for the practising certificates while others refused to apply, questioning the costs involved and the legality of the administrative arrangement. The committee found that due to the failure for 17 years by the Ministry of Health political technical leadership to institute a Pharmacy Board, confusion was created in the pharmacy practice.

Mr Speaker, on the reactivation of the Pharmacy Board, the committee was informed that the board was launched on 9 February 2012 after 17 years of inactivity; it commenced operations immediately but faced critical challenges including, among which, that the board structures were still problematic, with no chief medical officer as the chairperson and chief pharmacist as the registrar as required by the law

The board, not being a body corporate, was not sure how to collect the prescribed fees and where to bank the fees collected. 

The board lacked enough logistics such as a seal, stamp, and furniture as these had not been budgeted for during the budgeting process. 

Mr Speaker, it took the board six months to begin to register and issue registration certificates to the qualified applicants. From July 2012 to date, 111 pharmacists, including the petitioners were registered by the board. 

With respect to the specific prayers made by the petitioners, the committee would like to report as follows:

Prayer for immediate registration of the petitioners 

The petitioners were registered on 16 July 2012 and evidence is here attached. They were registered exactly 13 days after petitioning Parliament thus their prayer on immediate registration was answered. 

On the prayer for compensation by the Minister of Health for loss of income, the committee was informed that even before their registration, the petitioners were offered employment by the Ministry of Health. This suggests that the petitioners may not be fair to claim compensation due to loss of income arising from their non-registration by the malicious Ministry of Health or Pharmacy Board when the same body they are accusing actually offered them employment. Evidence of the employment of the petitioners is here attached. 

On the outstanding policy or the legal issues, the committee noted that the legality of the recently launched Pharmacy Board remains questionable although attempts have been made to gazette the position of the Director General Health Services and Assistant Commissioner Pharmaceuticals to replace the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Pharmacist respectively; the status quo remains. Consultation between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs and the Ministry of Public Service had not yet resolved the matter. 

The committee recommends that the three ministries concerned with the resignation of the positions in question should urgently resolve the matter. The Minister of Health should report to Parliament on the resolution of the matter within two months. 

On the regulations of the certificates that were issued during the abeyance of the board, the committee noted that there were four types of certificates issued to the pharmacists in Uganda. These include practicing certificates issued by the Pharmacy Board before 1993; practicing certificates issued by the pharmacists’ council, a board that was administratively put in place by the Minister of Health during the abeyance of the Pharmacy Board. Practicing certificates issued by the pharmaceutical society of Uganda during the abeyance of the Pharmacy Board and before an administrative arrangement of the pharmacists’ council was put in place by the Minister of Health and lastly the practicing certificates issued by the re-launched Pharmacy Board in July 2012 whose legal status is yet to be ascertained. 

The committee recommends therefore that the current confusion be addressed by regularising all the practising certificates by having a single uniform practicing certificate issued by one authority namely the Pharmacy Board. 

The committee further recommends that the pharmacy council and the pharmaceutical society of Uganda and the Pharmacy Board should be put to task by the relevant organs of the state to account for the certificate fees collected from the pharmacists since 1993. 

In conclusion, the committee’s overall finding was that the Ministry of Health failed in 17 years to execute its mandate of constituting a Pharmacy Board that would register and issue practising certificates to the pharmacists and discipline the errant ones. This caused confusion and anarchy and financial loss to the government since registration fees were not collected. It also caused anxiety and frustration among the qualifying pharmacists. 

The committee found that in 1912, the Ministry of Health re-launched the Pharmacy Board that had been in abeyance for many years whose legal status is yet to be affirmed. Consequently the prayers of the petitioners were addressed. However, the outstanding issues discussed above should be address urgently to return normalcy to the pharmacy profession. Mr Speaker and hon. Members, despite our delay, I beg that this House adopts this report. Thank you very much. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much, honourable chairman, for the report. Hon. Members, you can see that the urgent aspects of this petition have actually been dealt with in terms of issues of employment of the people who had not been registered and they were out of job. Those issues were addressed. But there are some substantial or legal issues and administrative issues that are raised by the report of the committee. We could have a discussion on this and then we see how to adopt this. 

3.05
MR PAUL MWIRU (FDC, Jinja Municipality East, Jinja): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to first thank the committee for the report. Actually, there is an issue to do with regulation which is very important because they are talking about people’s lives. The absence of the board –the failure on the part of the ministry explains why instead of finding drugs in pharmacies, we find them in local shops. I do not know whether the Ministry of Health is aware of the effect of this. This sector is not regulated. If you went to any town, the work which ought to have been done by qualified people is being done by common sellers. They prescribe medicines for patients and at the end of the day, this affects people’s lives. 

So as I rise to support the report, I want the Minister of Health to know that the gist of the matter was not just about these people getting jobs, as it looked to be, but it is about people’s lives. When the minister is responding, I want him to have that in mind; to know how many people are affected as a result of the inefficiency of his ministry. 

3.07
MR HENRY MUSASIZI (NRM, Rubanda County East, Kabale): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I will not thank the committee because when people bring petitions to Parliament they want urgent answers. This is a report that was supposed to be considered in 2012. Today we are in 2014; this lack of seriousness should not go unnoticed. 

Two, the committee did not interact with the petitioners themselves. Among the people they interacted with, I did not see the petitioners. This is a matter that also needs to be observed. 

Thirdly, I do not buy the argument that if someone is denied a certificate and is employed by a certain agency, he therefore should not be compensated for loss of opportunity. Employment in Uganda is an issue of choice; you do not compel someone to work for you. So probably if these people had got practicing certificates, they would have got better opportunities. So the idea of compensating them for loss of opportunity should not be disregarded. 

Lastly, I note that the issuing of certificates is under unclear laws. Since they have an association, this association can establish a council which can be responsible for issuing them with practicing certificates but, Mr Speaker, this is a matter that needs legislation. Thank you.

3.09
DR SAM LYOMOKI (NRM, Workers’ Representative): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I also want to thank the committee for presenting this good report. However, I want to request the committee and the Ministry of Health to always get to the root cause of this situation during the appropriation of the budget because whereas these pharmacists had been denied registration and being offered alternative jobs – what I know is that right now there are a lot of complaints in the entire system. It appears that in the pharmaceutical industry, for one to be registered to practice, there are a lot of conspiracies and some people are denied certificates because it also has to do with the control of the pharmacies in terms of who is in charge of the pharmacy; it is just a business thing. 

So, if they don’t bribe the concerned officers, they cannot access certain systems. But I request that the committee should do more analysis into those governance and administrative issues. There are a lot of personal issues in terms of complaints where some people have controlled the industry and so they don’t allow new people to join. So, the committee at an appropriate time should go in details and find out what the situation is like.

There is also the Pharmaceutical Bill that has been here but was taken back many times. This Bill, if worked on would be able to rationalise the way pharmacies operate. They have a lot of certificates and bodies together with a lot of contradictions. This law will be able to address this situation. So, I don’t know how the Pharmaceuticals Bill can be fast-tracked so that it can become a law, to harmonize all these issues. Thank you very much.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much. Hon. Members, let me just inform you that I have a problem with Rule 34 because the Prime Minister’s Question Time was supposed to start at 3.00 p.m. under that rule and to take 45 minutes. However, we are already in the middle of this discussion. I will ask you to use the remaining time to conclude this matter so that we can give the Prime Minister the 45 minutes that he needs to deal with issues under Rule 34.

3.12
MR WILFRED NIWAGABA (NRM, Ndorwa East, Kabale): Thank you, Mr Speaker –(Interjections) – this is not a maiden speech. I have had the occasion to handle matters to do with the pharmaceutical society and the profession itself but I believe this particular report did not get to the gist of the matter. First of all, there is no clear law - even when you see the pharmacists practicing, they do so under the National Drug Policy and Authority Act. In doing so, the Authority issues licenses to pharmacists who are employed by the owners of the pharmacies. So, in effect the owners operate under the licenses issued to the pharmacists. So, this makes it a very ambiguous relationship.

Secondly, I know for a fact that we have so many pharmacies in this country but when you look at the report, there are only 111 pharmacies listed. That is not true yet this is a central area to the entire system of health. So, my suggestion would be that the Minister of Health comes up with a concrete statement on what Government is going to do to regularise the practicing of the pharmacy profession. Otherwise, we are sitting on a time bomb, Mr Speaker.

3.14
MS JESCA ABABIKU (Independent, Woman Representative, Adjumani): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the committee for the report but also to thank hon. Alice Alaso for having presented this petition. My main concern is the 17 years’ duration that was taken and I wonder what if this petition hadn’t been brought; wasn’t this problem going to remain buried? 
So, this should send a signal and a reminder to the various ministries to always crosscheck their operations. We have so many staff in the ministry but 17 years down the road we were not aware about this and it was eating up our people. To me, this is a big challenge.

Secondly, on the issue of compensation, the chairperson says that will not arise. But I want to be convinced that all those who qualified are already employed so that we do not compensate them to avert duplication. Because for 17 years and you are telling me that these people are already employed yet there is a high level of unemployment; you need to convince me on that.

Lastly, two or three weeks ago, I watched a news piece on NTV how some people have been deregistered because of poor practices. So, the issue of the existence of the board to process certification is very important and we need to go even deeper in order to save lives; to look at what somebody has read and how this person is going to apply that knowledge because many people die when they are taken to the theatre and because they cannot pursue these matters through court, nothing comes out. So, the issue of registration through the exercise of verification needs to be prioritised so that our lives are protected. Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay, I think I will have the Member who presented the petition before we listen to the minister and then we will close.

3.17
MS ALICE ALASO (FDC, Woman Representative, Serere): Thank you, Mr Speaker. There are times when you say thank you to the committee just because one wants to appear very courteous and so, it becomes very difficult to say it for courteous’ sake. But clearly for two years and you are jobless on the streets and waiting for a committee to consider your petition was a very difficult time for these young people!
 
I want to state for the record, unless maybe guided by somebody else or a better authority, that pharmacy is still the most expensive course in this country and they take the best brains in the country in regard to sciences. So, you must get AAAs or AAAAs to get admission in pharmacy on Government sponsorship and should you choose to do it on your own, you will pay through the nose. So, the plight, the prayers and the move by these pharmacists that took two years to get back to the Floor was actually a very desperate move. 

Mr Speaker, while I appreciate the findings of the committee, I am actually disturbed by the fact that it occurred to the committee that they were able to establish the need to enforce and in general management by the Ministry of Health, there is need to enforce that somebody must have a practicing certificate and the same Ministry of Health takes 17 years not thinking about how the pharmacy practicing certificate gets into the hands of the practitioner who requires it!

So, what is the enforcement about if you are not keen to ensure that the graduates get the certificate on time because enforcement is about regulation? So, what do you want to regulate when you are not giving them the means to prove that they are qualified to practice? I hope that the Ministry of Health will say to this House that they are making a serious commitment so that the next batch that has just graduated does not have to come to us with another petition and then they register them six days after. If they could register them six days after petitioning Parliament, it seems to me, Mr Speaker, that this was just a question of negligence. They had the ability to do it but they were just terrified by the move that the students came to this House. 

In a country where there are all sorts of people dispensing all sorts of drugs from expired to any type of drug, in a country where you have such an acute shortage of pharmacists, you can ill-afford to have one pharmacist graduate. Yesterday, I listened to a case where somebody has been undergoing treatment for seven years on misdiagnosis in such a country; surely, we can do better. Thank you.

3.32
THE MINISTER OF HEALTH (Dr Ruhakana Rugunda): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the Chairman of the Health Committee for the report that he has given over this important matter of pharmaceutical practice in our country. I also want to thank the compatriots who put in the petition to Government and to Parliament to get this matter sorted out. I share the view that 17 years is too long for a matter of this importance to be sorted out. 

Mr Speaker, as proposed by the committee and also proposed by hon. Niwagaba, Government will in two months come up with a comprehensive statement giving the general direction and the policy position over this matter; definitely with a view to bringing to an end this state of paralysis and uncertainty in the sector. 

Suffice to say, Mr Speaker, that there has been some kind of tug-of-war by the various centres in pharmaceutical practice, and this has made some of the consultations which are already going on again, by the way, on this matter a little more difficult but we are going to resolve it and two months from now, we will come with a statement that will clarify the position of Government on how the pharmaceutical practice is going to be streamlined. 

The last comment is on the importance of drugs. It is true that Uganda, like many other developing countries is now being used as a dumping ground by some of the big companies and some trading houses who take advantage of the inability of some of the countries to be able to properly asses the quality of drugs and even counterfeits. But Government, through the National Drug Authority, is working with various partners to ensure that we rapidly build the capacity of Uganda so that the quality of drugs coming in our country can be wholesome and also more importantly to encourage local manufacturing of quality drugs so that our people can be beneficiaries and can be treated with drugs that are indeed wholesome. 

So, I support the gist of the report and I promise that Government takes this matter very seriously and the position of Government will be in this House within the next two months from now. I thank you, Sir.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much. Mr Chairman, do you want to say something or should I put the question? 

DR OMONA: Thank you, Mr Speaker and I want to thank colleagues for the support that I see as far as our report is concerned. Allow me make one last apology especially to the petitioners. Surely look at this petition, it has been with this committee in fact even before I took leadership of this committee and maybe we surely should say we are sorry to the petitioners. It has been long but I thank you for supporting this report and I also thank the honourable Minister for Health for seeing that this is good and will work together on this massive area of health. I thank you very much, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I put the question to the adoption of the report on the Committee on Health on this petition by the members of the pharmaceutical society of Uganda; I put a question to the approval.
 
(Question put and agreed to.)

(Report adopted)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: We will now move to the item that had been suspended for 15 minutes. Under rule 34, I will now allow the engagement with the Prime Minister for the next 45 minutes.

PRIME MINISTER’S QUESTION TIME

3.25
MR DENIS OBUA (NRM, Ajuri County, Alebtong): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Whereas I salute the Minister of Public Service for trying to pay the outstanding salaries of public servants - is the Prime Minister aware that the acting Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Public Service has acted in that capacity for more than one year which is contrary to the mainstream Public Service rules and regulations and standing orders? And if so, when is Government intending to recruit a substantive permanent secretary in the Ministry of Public Service?

3.26
THE PRIME MINISTER (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Mr Speaker, as my honourable friend, Denis Hamson Obua knows very well, and it was only last week or two weeks ago that indeed we talked about in this Parliament the constitution of the Public Service Commission, this has not been completed for the reasons that we talked about. The matter is before Parliament and as soon as this matter is over, which I know Parliament is handling very well and expeditiously, I expect that all those outstanding issues will be settled. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Just for information, the Parliamentary Appointments committee has finalised with that except one person who was not approved so there may be a slight delay in that replacement.
3.27
MR PAUL MWIRU (FDC, Jinja Municipality East, Jinja): Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Central Government provides salaries, accommodation and infrastructure to Government boarding schools. May I know why the charging of fees is left in the hands of the head teacher and the Board of Governors which has led to charging of exorbitant fees in these government schools despite Government making such an effort in supporting such government boarding schools?

3.28
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): As my honourable friend Paul Mwiru, I say “Mwiru” in Rukiga knows very well - I know the Musoga doesn’t know what I am telling him – he knows that Government indeed does not charge fees but in these schools where Government does not provide capitation grant it has been the practice that through the Parents Teachers Associations (PTAs) of the schools; they take some decisions, which sometimes have monetary implications and I believe that that particular question falls under that category. Thank you.

3.29
MR MICHAEL MAWANDA (NRM, Igara County East, Bushenyi): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Last year, this Parliament legislated and passed two oil laws, which provide for the establishment of a Petroleum Authority and a National Oil Company. I would like to know how far the Executive has gone in establishing these institutions. The absence of these institutions is affecting the progress and performance of various activities in this sector. I thank you.

3.30
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Yes, that is correct and my response to hon. Mawanda is that as you may recollect, we gave very heavy duties to this authority. The ministry and the departments concerned are going through a rigorous exercise of identifying suitable people to constitute this authority, and the regulations are about to be completed. When these two have been done, I am sure the line minister will announce the establishment of the authority with clear names and I think they are supposed to bring those regulations or guidelines to Parliament. Thank you.

3.31
MS KEVINAH TAAKA (FDC, Busia Municipality, Busia): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I stand here under Rule 34 of the Rules of Procedure. On 2 October 2013, during the 41st Sitting of the Third Session of this Parliament, we discussed a report on Ugandan traders in South Sudan. I want to ask the Prime Minister how far the two governments of Uganda and South Sudan have gone in verifying the claims of the traders and how they are effecting the compensation of these traders.

Secondly, what arrangements has the Government of Uganda put down in facilitating a conducive environment of trade for the Ugandan traders who go to South Sudan?

Mr Speaker, the third one is how far has Government gone -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Please, let him deal with those ones. Under this rule, it is direct questions one at a time. Okay.

3.32
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Well, as my honourable friend knows very well, there were some changes in Government in the Republic of South Sudan. A new set of ministers has now taken charge of running that government and one of the first activities they carried out was to send a delegation comprising of the Minister of Finance and the Attorney-General of the new Cabinet here. They did hold discussions with their counterparts here and there were a number of issues they needed to be clarified. 

The process of going through that is being handled and our government is very well aware of the difficulties this has caused to our traders. We are doing everything possible to expedite this and as soon as the other side is ready, we will be informing the public about the outcome. Thank you.

3.34
PROF. KASIRIVU ATWOOKI (NRM, Bugangaizi County West, Kibaale): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Towards the close of 2011, I presented a petition on behalf of the tobacco farmers who had been contracted by Continental Tobacco. The company had not paid them for their leaves. This Parliament recommended that they pay the farmers with interest in accordance with the tobacco regulations. Parliament mandated the Ministry responsible for Trade to make a report to this House on the developments. It is now two years and we have never got a progress report on that matter. Can I ask the Prime Minister whether we shall ever get that report?

3.35
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi) Yes, that is an issue that I am reminded of every day because the tobacco farmers in my constituency are equally affected. The problem was that that company had not paid people for tobacco that they had delivered previously, and the ministry took action to try and safeguard the interests of tobacco farmers. Now I am glad to inform this House that an MOU has been entered between Continental Tobbacco and the ministry with a clear timetable for them to pay both the arrears and what is now owed so that they can begin to operate normally again. Thank you.

3.36
MS BEATRICE ANYWAR (FDC, Woman Representative, Kitgum): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would like to find out from the Rt Hon. Prime Minister whether he is aware of the existing power struggle or conflict between the Office of the RDC, the LCV Chairperson and the office of the District Police Commander in Kitgum. The Police Commander interfered with his job and he is directed to arrest all the political opponents hence causing insecurity in the district. Would the Prime Minister interest himself and direct the responsible officers to redefine the roles of these two offices: the office of the RDC and the office of the District Police Commander?

3.37
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): I fully accept my dear friend Beatrice Anywar’s suggestion that we must streamline the roles of these offices to make sure that such conflicts are avoided. We will interest ourselves in greater detail about what is happening in Kitgum with a view to solving whatever small problems may exist. Thank you.

3.38
MS DOROTHY NSHAIJA (NRM, Woman Representative, Kamwenge): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I remember that the year before last year, in April, we presented the issue of the people of Kamwenge who were chased away from the so-called Rwamwanja Camp. They went to court and won the case because they had titles. Can I know -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Please re-state the question.

MS NSHAIJA: I was saying that in April 2012, hon. Frank Tumwebaze and I presented an important issue in this Parliament concerning the people of Kamwenge who were chased away from the so-called Rwamwanja Camp. They went to court over the so-called government land title for that camp and won the case because they had genuine land titles. Up to today, these bona fide occupants of that land are still not being compensated or being given any relief. So, can I get an answer from the Prime Minister for the people of Kamwenge who are suffering despite the fact that we are hosting 50,000 refugees in our district? I thank you.

3.39
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Well, you know, Mr Speaker, that this is a matter being handled by the disaster preparedness department and I would like to seek the understanding of the House that you let me find out exactly the details of what is happening on this because I do not have it now. I thank you.

3.40
MS FLORENCE NAMAYANJA (DP, Bukoto County East, Masaka): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would like to find out from the Prime Minister: the NRM Government has a policy on automatic promotion in UPE schools and I would like to find out from you why Parliament should continue giving money for examinations in primary schools when it is automatic that from one class to the other, children can just go on. 

I also want to find out whether this is improving on the policy of education and whether we are not creating two categories of Ugandans: those who are employable and those who are not because most of you, ministers, have your children in non UPE schools. So, I want to find out what value addition is UPE adding to Ugandans and whether it is beneficial to Ugandans?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Rt Hon. Prime Minister, automatic promotions?

3.41
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Mr Speaker, I did not know that hon. Florence Namayanja could ask a question like that but now that she has asked - because I know she knows the answers and she just hopes that I do not know. Automatic promotion is of course as we know, to avoid clogging in schools. This is the problem we had had all along and the solution for that was automatic promotion in order to avoid clogging. Am I not answering it properly? So you have the answer? I am ready to take information from you.

MR SSASAGA: The question was and maybe you did not get it so well. Why do we continue giving funds for the marking of examinations in primary schools more so that the government policy favours automatic promotion? So we want the answer.

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: Unfortunately, I cannot adopt that answer that my colleague has offered because really it is not an answer to the question. My answer is on the first one about automatic promotions and I thought that is what she wanted me to respond to. Automatic promotions are to avoid clogging.

Now that payment you are referring to is for purposes of assessment because you know that when you finish primary school going on to senior – if hon. Florence Namayanja is unhappy with me as I can see, I undertake to come with a more comprehensive answer. I thank you. (Laughter)

3.44
MS FLORENCE MUTYABULE (NRM, Woman Representative, Namutumba): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would like to ask the Prime Minister how far Government has gone with the amendment of the Children’s Act. I asked this question the other time and you promised that the minister would come and present to this honourable House the progress. This process has taken very long as it is now eight years down the road since Parliament resolved and ordered the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development to amend this Act. Many children are dying out there; many children are not protected but we are protecting ourselves as adults. Is Government really sensitive about the children of Uganda? I need the answer.

3.45
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Well, my dear friend, hon. Florence Mutyabule knows very well that this Government is very sensitive to the welfare of children and that is why we have taken all the steps that we have done in the increase of the wellbeing of our children. We still have laws in place including that one that needs to be amended. There are deficiencies that we need to handle through the amendment and so, it is not the case that there is no law in place because there is a law in place. 

I am informed that the ministry responsible is going through the process of looking at the various proposals. We have, since you raised that question, indicated to them that we shall give them a special place on the Cabinet Agenda and as soon as they are ready, we will discuss that and bring it to Parliament when we have finalised. I thank you. 

3.46
MR MOSES KASIBANTE (DP, Rubaga Division North, Kampala): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I have a straight forward question but I just want to begin with the reminder on my earlier question. It is still pending without an answer. It was something to do with the age of the President vis-à-vis the constitutional limit. My question, hon. Prime Minister is how far Government has gone with the findings of the following fires: (i) Kasubi Royal Tombs; (ii) Buddo Junior School; and (iii) Naggalabi Coronation Site. And when will the reports ever be out? Thank you very much.

3.47
THE PRIME MINISTER/LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Mr Speaker, I thank hon. Kasibante for raising the question which I answered last time and my answer still stands. 

On the question of fires, I know that we, in Cabinet, have received the report on Kasubi but not yet the reports on the other two. But I undertake to come back with the response on the fires because the answer will not be the same as for the first question. Thank you.

3.48
MR GEORGE EKUMA (NRM, Bukedea County, Bukedea): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to ask the Prime Minister; Nakapiripirit, Kween and Bulambuli districts have enjoyed a harmonious relationship with the Bukedea people but we have problems with boundaries and we have officially written to the lands’ office but it seems they lack funds to clearly demarcate the boundaries. Shall the funds be availed to the Ministry of Lands so that our people will continue staying together in harmony to avoid a situation like the one between Adjumani and Amuru, which involved violence? 

3.49
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Yes. (Laughter)

3.49
MR KENNETH LUBOGO (Independent, Bulamogi County, Kaliro): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Hon. Prime Minister, the NRM Government made three very important pledges to the people of Bulamogi in Kaliro District and one of them was to extend power to all sub counties. The other was to upgrade Rumanya Health Centre IV to a hospital and the other was to tarmac the road from Kaliro to Gadumire. It is now two years before the next elections and yet all these were to be done in these five years. I want to hear from the Prime Minister whether Government is committed to fulfilling these pledges within the remaining years. If not, which of them is the government going to fulfil? Thank you.

3.50
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): We are completely committed and as my honourable colleague knows, this Government means what it says and within the time we still have in our term, we certainly will fulfil all the pledges we made. Thank you.

3.51
MR VINCENT SSEMPIJJA (Independent, Kalungu County East, Kalungu): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Hon. Prime Minister, recently, our farmers responded to our calls and they have massively planted food crops and I thank Government for the input through NAADS for the seeds we have received. But the most worrying issue here is that Government promised warehouses, silos and warehousing systems. What is happening is that neighbouring countries are constructing warehouses for our own produce; do you have any answer to the promises that were made by Government earlier on? Thank you.

3.52
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Hon. Ssempijja is absolutely right; Government has indeed encouraged our farmers to grow more in order to raise productivity and Government is fully aware of the post-harvest wastage that our people suffer. And, therefore, we have come to the conclusion that the only answer to this is having a comprehensive storage system that will help our farmers. We are in the process of engaging the private sector; we have talked to investors from outside countries with a view to attracting them to invest in establishing silos in this country, not only for our own purposes but to turn Uganda into a food basket for the region and beyond.

We are also very much conscious of the decisions we took in the past about the warehousing receipt system, which will help our farmers access finance for them to expand and widen their production. So you can be sure that we are completely focused on this one. Thank you.

3.54
MS ANGELLINE OSEGGE (FDC, Woman Representative, Soroti): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to know from the Prime Minister when you expect to roll out the state programme –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is that?

MS OSEGGE: That is the programme for the elderly; where they get some allowance of Shs 22,000 per month. This is because the pilot process is over and the rest of the country is waiting for this programme to be rolled out. May I know what is going on and what I should tell the people of Soroti? Thank you.

3.55
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Mr Speaker, she is right that we have had the pilot scheme that covers 14 districts where we introduced this idea – state welfare kind of approach – where we give a monthly stipend to the elderly; that is those who are 65 years and above except for Karamoja where the age is slightly lower at 60 years. We have had the support of DFID, the British Development Aid Programme, which has been very helpful and certainly in the districts where it is being piloted, the elderly have truly appreciated this gesture from Government. 

We have discussed this even in the framework paper which we presented to this Parliament. If you study it, you will find that we have covered it. The bottleneck we have is only the cost. It is a good programme but can this country afford it yet? Even what we are able to spend now, which is about Shs 24 billion, is mainly provided by the British Development Aid and Irish programme. 

We certainly look forward to the day we will raise great revenue for this nation and on our priority will be to look at the elderly, and see how this Government will cater for the welfare of that category of our people. 

4.58
MR ANTHONY OKELLO (NRM, Kioga County, Amolatar)): Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is in relation to a new and strange type of water weed that has caused a thick cover on some sections of the water surface on Lake Kyoga, locally named “Nankabirwa Weed” –(Laughter)

My people would like to have responses on the following: What is the origin of this weed whose spread in Lake Kyoga seems to go unabated? Secondly, what could be the likely effect of this weed on aquatic life: and three, given that this weed has enormously affected the fishing expedition in Lake Kyoga and hence causing food insecurity in the area, how prepared is the government to deal with the Nankabirwa weed menace which has affected the livelihood of the people for over six months now?

4.00
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Well, as hon. Okello knows every well, I am not aware of the naming of this weed; therefore, I will not refer to it by the name he has offered but it is true Government is fully aware of this problem. It is a new weed on our water. We think it has been encouraged by the new aquatic life in the way we handle our water bodies, mainly because of over degradation of our shoreline. Government is determined to reverse this – of course, it is a very wide issue; it has everything to do with environmental degradation and our aggressive rural electrification is part of the solution in order to restore our environment. 

We know how serious this new water weed is to aquatic life because apparently it absorbs all the oxygen so the fish and other living organisms in that area cannot survive because of insufficiency of oxygen. We are determined, as we did handle the water weed in the past successfully, to handle this as well. Studies have been carried out that suggest that this water weed could be harvested and turned into positive uses like generating animal feed; generating power and things like that. So, these are things that we are studying and the systems are at an advanced stage. 

We have used biological methods to fight the weed that had been here before successfully; we have used physical means to fight that water hyacinth. Since we succeeded previously, I have confidence that even this new water weed will be successfully combated. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Members, we have 10 minutes left. 

4.04
MR GILBERT OLANYA (Independent, Kilak County, Amuru): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Hon. Prime Minister, in the just concluded recruitment of the police constables and cadet officers, we were informed that 20 police constables shall be recruited per district and five cadet officers. Are you aware that in many districts in Northern Uganda very few police constables and cadet officers were recruited? For example, in Amuru District, only one cadet officer was recruited; in Nwoya District, only five police constables were recruited and other lists were taken from elsewhere and fixed as if they came from those districts. 

Can the Government avail us with the list of police officers and cadet officers recruited recently?

4.05
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Well, hon. Gilbert Olanya knows very well that this is a recent exercise. Actually, I have not received the report of that exercise yet so I really do not have an answer. When we get the report, then I should be able to stand here and give you a definite answer. Right now, I wouldn’t want to engage in the exercise of speculation. When the relevant minister comes, he will give you figures and facts. If some districts were not able to meet their quota, I am sure there would be an explanation. Certainly the list will be known because we have always been transparent in this. Thank you. 

4.06
MS MARGARET KIBOIJANA (NRM, Woman Representative, Ibanda): Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is on the pension’s nightmare in Uganda. The laws of Uganda provide that civil servants on retirement shall qualify for pension. However, accessing the pension payroll in Uganda has become a nightmare. Old pensioners have been made to line-up for years without getting on the payroll. Some have died before succeeding and many more might die before accessing the payroll. Many have been fleeced of their hard earnings by middlemen at the Ministry of Public Service who pose as rescuers.

My questions are: what steps is Government taking to streamline the pensions sector? Two, how can Government fast-track the pensions issue to address the backlog? Three, why can’t the system be computerized that one’s name appears on the pensions list automatically the moment one clocks retirement age?

4.08
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Well, Mr Speaker, yes, the hon. Kiboijana is right. This issue of pension has given us a few questions. At the recent Annual Government Performance Report at a retreat, which we held, I gave the ministry responsible two weeks to come up with a comprehensive report that will cover all those questions that have been raised by the hon. Kiboijana. 

The two weeks end this week. I expect that by next week, I will have read that report so that I can give you clear answers. But everyone knows that we have had some issues in the pensions office and I can inform this House that there is an active investigation of the activities of that office. As soon as we have the reports from both the department and the investigators, we will be able to give you a clear picture. 
Thank you.

4.10
MR GODFREY LUBEGA (Independent, Kassanda North, Mubende): When you were distributing road equipment, you promised to reallocate one unit to wide and large districts like Mubende. Is the promise still standing or not? If so, when do we hope to get them?

4.11
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): As hon. Lubega may know, we go through a process. I would like to inform this House that another procurement process is underway and as soon as it has been done, you will get the equipment. Thank you.

4.12
MS ROSE AKOL (NRM, Woman Representative, Bukedea): Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question relates to the European Development Fund (EDF) for the period 2011/2020. This EDF is available at all member countries including Uganda. The final negotiations on the programmes to be funded using this EDF fund are on course.

According to the Cotonou Agreement, ACP member parliaments are supposed to be involved and, therefore, participate in the formulation of these programmes. So, when is Government presenting a paper for debate to this Parliament for parliamentary participation in the EDF programme process?

Two, there is this issue of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA). What is the position of Government on EPA? What is the framework for negotiations? Is it bilateral or regional basis? When is Government presenting a statement to Parliament on this matter because ACP member parliaments are entitled to this information? 

I thank you.

4.14
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Yes, Mr Speaker, this matter is being handled. We have reserved space for it in Cabinet within the coming two weeks. As soon as it is through, we should be able to come to Parliament and give a formal report. Thank you.

4.15
MR MATHIAS NUSUBUGA (DP, Bukoto County South, Lwengo): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Is the Rt Hon. Prime Minister aware that when you go around the city, some of the public roads have been bought off by tycoons in the city? When you drive through the city and not only in the city, even in other towns, there are parking lots reserved for some tycoons. 
Is this a government policy and if so, when were public roads privatised?

4.16
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi):Mr Speaker, my good brother, the hon. Mathias Nsubuga knows very well that many of these roads are under the authority of local governments, which regularly take decisions locally on a number of issues.

I will need to check to find out the details of what he is saying. But as you know, either in this or in the previous Parliament, we passed a law authorising the local governments to take certain measures in order to raise revenue. 

So, my suspicion is that those are revenue generating measures including the registration of vehicles in a special way if one pays for it; it is income generating but I will come back to you when I get a clearer picture. Thank you.

4.17
MR STEPHEN MUKITALE (NRM, Buliisa County, Buliisa): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Rt Hon. Prime Minister, the Government of Uganda has been working very hard to confirm the commercial viability of our oil. Eight years ago, it was confirmed. But to date, the first commercialisation of the drilling of the first barrel is increasingly becoming obscure and uncertain. 
In January, H.E, the President signed a memorandum of understanding with oil companies. But to the contrary, the oil companies are scaling down with a reason that they are waiting for licenses. The service providers and other Ugandans who are going into local content are currently packing their equipment as per the 31 March – even the community liaison officers have been terminated from work because it may take another 18 months for serious work to start.

Rt Hon. Prime Minister, would you like Parliament to benefit from a comprehensive road map, a comprehensive report on inter-ministerial activities with the budget line on what the oil companies will do and what Government will do? This is important because they are complaining about the lack of the infrastructure and money. 

So, would you want this Parliament to help Government in the fast-tracking of the commercialisation of this oil? As you are aware other neighbours like Kenya are already moving commercial. We could have a problem as a country; we are already complaining about donor cuts and unemployment but while failing to harness our own resources and instead, continue to beg from donors?

4.19
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): As hon. Stephen Mukitale knows very well, this Government appears to have been slow in the management of our oil discoveries. He knows that this has been for a good cause. First of all, we are determined to build internal capacity to be able to handle this sector not depending on experts from outside only but having a baseline on which we could stand as a country to handle our oil. Secondly, we have had big arguments with oil companies, we have insisted as he knows very well and everyone here knows that we must refine here. We must have an oil refinery in Uganda because of the significance of having an oil refinery so that we build a gas and oil industry in Uganda, and that was not readily accepted by investors because they preferred to export raw oil. 

The good news is as has been in the public domain, Government has signed a commercialisation plan   with oil companies, one of them, CNOOC, a Chinese oil company has already been licenced; the other two, Total and Tullow, are being evaluated by our experts and we expect that this evaluation will be concluded soon, so that they too are granted production licences. 

Our plan is to have all this ready so that Uganda is ready for oil production by the year 2016, and in 2017 both the oil refinery and the pipeline to export some crude oil will be ready and that is the plan that has taken long but has taken into account best practices from all over the world and we believe in order to avoid the oil curse that we have all talked about, it was necessary to do so and we move with confidence that this oil will fully and truly bring change to our lives as a nation. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: We have exceeded the time already. I think we will stop at half past. We have already exceeded the time by five minutes.

4.22
MS NABILAH NAGGAYI (FDC, Woman Representative, Kampala): I want to ask the Rt Hon. Prime Minister, the media is awash with the adverts on the national IDs and they are encouraging everybody in this country to go and get a national ID. I would want to know from the Prime Minister, what category of people in Uganda will be given the national Id and when?

4.23
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Hon. Nabilah Sempala, if she checks her archives, she will find a statement that was made to Parliament that has answers to those questions.

MS NAGGAYI: National IDs are used for several reasons in different countries, to track citizens, to track foreigners.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, now you are giving a speech. The question was that there are adverts about when people should go and get IDs. When and where will this happen? And who can get them?

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: I can repeat what is in the advert; any Ugandan 16 years old and above is entitled to having an ID. The process is underway, we gave dates. We said by July, we will have finished the process and we will be issuing ID cards to all Ugandans who are entitled. I will be happy to ask the minister to circulate to Members of Parliament again this timetable of the work that is being coordinated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs so that everyone has a clear picture of the time in which we are working. 

We are determined to have this exercise ready before the census as you know the census is planned for August; we are determined to have the ID cards before the next election so that there is no possibility of in any way tampering with the vote.

4.26
MR SIMON ALEPER (NRM, Moroto Municipality, Moroto): Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Rt Hon. Prime Minister may recall that Ugandan Parliament enacted an Act called the KDA Act of 1987 and it was out of this Act that many Ugandans got employed under a body called Karamoja Development Agency. As we talk now, most of these Ugandans were retired without benefits, others have died. 

So, I would like to know from the Prime Minister what the Government plan is on these Ugandans who have retired and are waiting for their benefits and the government’s plan on KDA. Thank you. 

4.27
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): I undertake to get the answers because I note the absence of Karamoja on the front bench, so, I will get the answers.

4.28
MR ROLAND MUGUME (FDC, Rukungiri Municipality, Rukungiri): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Rt Hon. Prime Minister, Inspector General of Police has denied people in police uniform condoning off Dr Kiiza Besigye’s home. My question is, can you order investigations on those who are posing as policemen mounted road blocks at the entrance of Dr Kiiza Besigye, using police uniform and actually, they have even police pick up and guns? Thank you.

4.29
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Hon. Mugume actually knows very well that it is not possible in Uganda now for people to pose with uniforms, guns, vehicles and just keep like that for a long time. So, I am not aware that anyone is causing – I am going to ask the minister and the Police Force to check if there are some masqueraders around and take appropriate action. Thank you.

4.30
MR JOHN AMOS OKOT (NRM, Agago County, Agago): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would like to ask the Prime Minister a question concerning the ex-combatants or service men. If you hold any public rally or meeting in Agago, you will be asked when Government shall settle their claims.

Secondly, I would like to ask why you do not release a press statement so that these people get clear information regarding their pay. I thank you.

MRS OGWAL: Thank you, Rt Hon. Speaker -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: There is a question pending, Opposition Chief Whip.

4.31
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Mr Speaker, hon. Amos Okot has asked about ex-service men and their claims. It is true that this has been an outstanding claim. As I have said here over and over again, for the last many years, it is an issue that Government has paid attention to and we have started paying. The total bill is a colossal sum and we have been paying quite a bit of money but unfortunately, we do not have enough resources to settle all of them at a go; it is impossible. 

I think we must have covered this in the framework paper as well and if you look at it, you will see that ex-servicemen settlements or what is due to them are actually given as priority. It is among the priority items, which are not funded but which will be the first to be handled when revenue generation improves. 

Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The rules allow the Opposition Chief Whip or the Leader of the Opposition to wrap up on these issues and then the Prime Minister will close. Briefly, Madam.

4.33
THE CHIEF OPPOSITION WHIP (Mrs Cecilia Ogwal): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the Prime Minister for brilliantly answering the questions that were raised. However, I think the Prime Minister must be ready at all times and must have facts at his fingertips. We get surprised and embarrassed to see the Prime Minister consulting ministers during the Prime Minister’s question time. Those of us who have been following the Commonwealth system of firing questions to the Prime Minister - the Prime Minister must sharpen his mind and shape himself to be ready to answer any odd question and as you can see, the questions, which were asked today are common questions. People want to know why teachers have not been paid, what the condition of the hospitals is and other simple questions; why is Dr Kiiza Besigye’s house being mounted by illegal policemen and you do not even know. 

So, these are facts you must be armed with and you should be ready to answer. You do not have to ask any minister to guide you on how to answer the question, you should be ready. About the oil, you must be ready and tuned to answer cold and hot questions. I think that is the kind of Prime Minister we want in the Ugandan Parliament.

When we started the session this afternoon, we were very upset that we did not have people to answer very sensitive issues concerning the health condition in the country. The people were not there - [Prof. Kabwegyere: “Order”] - How do you order when I am answering as a shadow Prime Minister?

PROF. KABWEGYERE: Mr Speaker, is it in order for the honourable Leader of the Opposition to imagine that she is a teacher to the Prime Minister? Is she in order?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I would have to ask the professor to cite for me the rules where imagination is prohibited.

MRS OGWAL: Mr Speaker, to be a good legislator, you must be ready to be a professor and to be a student. At any time you can be a professor, at any time you must be ready to be a student to learn -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Leader of the Opposition, please.

MRS OGWAL: So, I just want to say, as Leader of the Opposition on this side, that next time I would want the Prime minister to come more prepared and be able to answer questions. Otherwise, I thank all of you and I am satisfied with the manner in which the questions have been asked and I think I must thank my team. I think you are very well read and very well versed with – and also on the Movement side, I think I have been very impressed with some of the questions.

Mr Speaker, one thing I would like to put to the Prime Minister is the issue of farmers in Uganda which must be addressed with seriousness. You know that for the last five years, Members of Parliament have been asking you to put right the situation of the Cotton sub sector. The CDO has continued to mess up the cotton sub sector and has continued to collect illegal tax from the cotton farmers. They are using the money to fund ginners who are supposed to be investors and to finance CDO, which is a parastatal organisation.

You are aware that CDO benefits from the budget line. You are aware that every year, there are talks about buying tractors, buying pieces of land and buying chemicals to sell but nobody has been able to ask CDO where it deposits the revenue from those sales.

Much as we are concerned about oil, we have not seen it yet. Let us deal with what we have. So, Rt Hon. Prime Minister, next time you come, I will ask you questions related to farming. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Members, we could have used this time better if the questions were short, precise and direct but we were elaborating, so, we lost a lot of time on that.

Secondly, where this Prime Minister’s question time works very well is that the general areas of coverage are normally sent in advance. The whips coordinate these activities and the areas, which are supposed to be covered they are forwarded in advance so that these consultations are done. If you went to the British House of Commons, for example, there are instances where the Prime Minister even has written responses on some subjects meaning that he had advance information about the kind of questions he was going to deal with. So, the purpose of this is not to test whether the Prime Minister knows but to find out what they are doing about the situations that are there. 

So, we are not testing his knowledge of these things. We want to know what they are doing about certain things. It is important that we coordinate this and our rules certainly have these gaps but they need now in practice to try and improve that the Whips should consult and coordinate these areas so that when the Prime Minister comes – like usually, they meet at Cabinet in the morning and in the afternoon, they should be able to be very well briefed and coordinated to deal with this.

The Rt Hon. Prime Minister, the last question.

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: Well, thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for that elucidation. Indeed, my memory of reasons as to why we took long to apply this rule is because we referred it to the rules committee to carry out a study of what goes on elsewhere and make recommendations on how we should handle it. 

Of course, as we can see, I am happy to answer even at no notice. I am very grateful to my sister for giving me the credit. She gave me the credit for doing that. She knows very well that I have answered all the questions and I am always transparent. Where I do not have answers, I actually say so and tell you that I will answer another time. 

Today, I think I had 27 questions and out of 27, I answered 24 fully and from your body language, to the satisfaction of every Member of Parliament. Therefore, I am not surprised that hon. Cecilia Ogwal using her knowledge obviously made the assessment she made here and I am happy to go along.

In future, I am going to fully apply the provisions of Rule 34 and use this opportunity to make a statement or two on matters that are current and important for the country so that we just do not sit here and begin to have the kind of exchange we have been having during this time.

The Speaker is absolutely right. It would be very helpful if some of these questions were asked in advance. Where you require detail, nobody, even my sister hon. Cecilia Ogwal has the capacity to store all information about teachers’ salaries, the pension of all ex-servicemen, the amount that CDO collects and where it is banked, why in the city some spaces have been reserved for particular individuals for parking and all those. 

I have a fairly sharp mind, as you know, but it is not possible. So, where we have questions that require detailed answers, it makes sense to ask in advance and not to test my knowledge just like that but for purposes of getting answers to questions that are critical to this nation.

Therefore, I would like to encourage that and we will receive questions if you have any in advance and we will be able to answer them and actually, give them priority every Wednesday during Prime Minister’s time. But thank you for your cooperation and I enjoy every moment that we go through this exchange.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. 

MOTION FOR THE PRESENTATION, CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE SECTORAL COMMITTEE ON HEALTH ON THE PETITION BY CHILDREN LIVING WITH SPINA BIFIDA

4.45
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON HEALTH (Dr Kenneth Omona): Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I had said earlier, the Committee on Health continues to generate more business for the House. I have come once again to present to the House a report of the Committee on Health on the petition by children living with Spina Bifida. I beg to lay a copy of this report on Table.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let the records capture the full text of the report.

(Full report to appear in monthly Hansard bound volume of April 2014)

DR OMONA: Mr Speaker, on 3 July 2012, hon. Milton Muwuma, the Member of Parliament for Kigulu County South, presented a petition on behalf of the children of Uganda living with Spina Bifida, a birth defect which means incomplete formation of the spinal bones or vertebrae around the part of the baby’s spinal cord.

In its severe form, it causes disability characterised by loss of sensation and paralysis of muscle groups, loss of bladder and bowel control, learning and developmental challenges as well as orthopaedic problems. 

The main concern for the petitioners was marginalisation in accessing treatment and other necessities of life. They complained about lack of accessories or aids for mobility such as wheel chairs, walking sticks, crutches, special shoes, learning aids, inaccessible public institutions such as schools, churches, hospitals, toilets, discrimination and stigmatisation by parents, relatives, teachers, health service providers and fellow children who are normal, inaccessible health facilities in rural areas, more government attention to adult persons with disabilities and no attention to children with disabilities.

The prayers of the petitioners were that Parliament urges Government to address their plight, particularly to:
    • Ensure that all schools are equipped with the necessary facilities for better learning of the children with Spina Bifida and hydrocephalous;
    • Strengthen sensitisation programmes among the teachers, parents, and the community about their role in protecting the rights of the children living with Spina Bifida;
    • Bring to justice those who defile, abuse and mistreat children with disabilities;
    • Mobilise more funds to support civil society organisations and programmes that provide care and support to the disabled children;
    • Implement mandatory food fortifications for foods in Uganda and improve care for pregnant women to prevent other children from being born with Spina Bifida.

Mr Speaker, a deep analysis of the prayers indicates that the children were asking Government to institute measures for the promotion of access to treatment and care and the dignity of children with disabilities and the prevention of other children from being born with Spina Bifida. 

Mr Speaker, since much of this was on policy issues, the government department or duty bearer that we had in trying to understand the interventions that were being made to address the plight of the petitioners, the committee heard from the Ministry of Health officials and those from the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development. 

Findings and observations 

There was comprehensive data or inventory of those children in Uganda. However, in 2006, much of Dimes’ Global Report on birth defects shows that Uganda has Spina Bifida prevalence of 12 to 19 per 10,000 births. Consequently, there were no government interventions targeting children with Spina Bifida as a unique category of children with disability. 

Instead, the committee was informed that government had put in place global initiatives targeting children with disability. This, therefore, means that specific concerns raised by the children with Spina Bifida as a unique category of disabled children in Uganda remain unattended to by Government. Below, we discuss some of the global interventions targeting undifferentiated children with disabilities. 

Government Response to needs of Children with Disability

Mr Speaker, we were informed that Government established a national implementation framework in support of the disabled school children with the following components:

    1. Uganda School Health Policy driven by both the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education and Sports, whose objective is to enhance the health status of school children.
    2. The Ministry of Health’s disability desk responsible for designing policies and coordinating activities to improve the lives of vulnerable disabled people.
    3. Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development as the lead agency mandated to ensure that the rights of children including the disabled children are promoted and upheld.
    4.  And also that public-private partnership to attract private initiatives to support disabled children through donation of appliances, especially learning materials and other school expenses.
    5. Community members who participate in the management of schools and village health teams that work to improve homecare for disabled children with Spina Bifida.

Mr Speaker, on the specific prayers of the petitioners and Government interventions, the committee appreciated the concerns of the petitioners with regard to lack of accessories for mobility such as wheelchairs, walking sticks, crutches, special shoes; lack of learning aids such as larger print texts; photocopies of notes for children with learning challenges, recorders, Braille papers and others.

The committee noted that the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education were grappling with the problem of the children with disability through the development of the school health sub-standards; requirements for enhanced environment for learning by all children with special health care needs and/or impairments were elaborated. It addresses issues such as the role of school nurse/clinic, village health teams and district health workers. However, these standards remain unimplemented due to poor funding.

However, the committee observed that it may be difficult to ensure that all schools, both private and public are equipped with facilities for use by children with Spina Bifida because of the budgetary constraints. Government should consider: (a) establishing well-equipped and regional based special needs schools for children with disability and to strengthen sensitisation programmes among the teachers, parents and the community about their roles in protecting the rights of children.

The committee also appreciated the concerns by the petitioners that they were being discriminated against and stigmatised by their parents, relatives, health workers, teachers, fellow children and Government. The concern that most, if not all, government programmes on disability targeted adult persons and not children was hurting. 

The committee observed that the foregoing concerns were a pointer that the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development that has the mandate to address disability issues had not prioritised sensitisation campaigns against discrimination and stigmatisation of children living with disability. The committee, therefore, recommends that the sensitisation and advocacy campaigns on the rights of children living with disabilities, including Spina Bifida, should be undertaken by the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development.

To bring justice to those who defile, abuse and mistreat children with disability, we observed that under the School Health Policy, mechanisms for the safety and security for the physical and mentally handicapped were cited. The committee also noted that Government had commissioned a study on violence against children to document the content, forms and manifestations of violence against children in Uganda and its main drivers. The committee also noted the effort by the Civil Society Organisations such as FIDA that were advocating for free legal services for the victims and the JLOS for developing friendly procedures for children who are sexually abused.

Furthermore, the committee noted the establishment of child-health line that has an emergency number – 116 – that can be used by children, members of households and individuals to report child abuse.

The committee recommends that the measure above should form part of the mass sensitisation and programmes about the rights of children to enable prompt reporting, apprehending and prosecution of abusers of children with disability.

Government should mobilise more funds to support civil society organisations and government programmes that provide care and support to disabled children as one of the prayers of the petitioners.

The committee noted that there were some efforts by the government and partners to provide care and support to children with disability. For example, there were efforts to introduce birth defects’ register. The committee was informed that the Uganda Virus Institute and Centre for Disease Control were screening for birth defects in the context of scaling up PMTCT option B+. In addition, the committee was informed that Global Team on Birth Defects was supporting screening for birth defects in Mbarara and Fort Portal Hospitals.

The committee recommended that the Ministry of Health should establish data of children born with disability, including the ones with Spina Bifida for proper planning.

Mandatory Food Fortification to improve Care for Pregnant Women and Children to prevent other children from being born with Spina Bifida and hydrocephalous.

Mr Speaker, it is known that folic acid has got immense potential to prevent Spina Bifida. However, it was found that most mothers are not aware of the importance of this in regard to Spina Bifida. The committee, therefore, recommends:

    (i) Government should embark on massive sensitisation, especially among pregnant mothers, the need for antenatal care with a clear explanation on the importance of folic acid in relation to Spina Bifida.
    (ii) Government should take it upon herself to consider fortification of foods consumed by pregnant mothers to reduce on the number of children born with Spina Bifida.

Mr Speaker, in conclusion, the committee wishes to say that Government has made commendable efforts in enacting policy, legal and institutional frameworks to address the needs of people with disabilities. However, the children living with Spina Bifida and hydrocephalous have not been targeted as a vulnerable category of children with disability. Consequently, this category of disabled people has been missing in policy statements and interventions and yet, ordinary Ugandans cannot afford the cost of treatment.

It is, therefore, incumbent upon the state to put in place measures and target state programmes to ensure the prayers of the children living with Spina Bifida are addressed. Moreover, their prayers are the minimum conditions that they need to live. It is, therefore, imperative that all Arms of the State work in tandem to ensure that the rights of these vulnerable discriminated and unknown citizens are protected and fulfilled in order to improve the quality of their life. 

On behalf of my committee, I beg that this House adopts this report. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Members, that is the report of the committee on that petition. You have heard that report; you have heard the recommendations and the prayers of the committee that the report be adopted. We will have limited debate on this matter.

MR MILTON MUWUMA (NRM, Kigulu County South, Iganga): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to appreciate the committee for the good work they did and taking interest in this particular petition. It is true, like the committee has observed, that very many mothers down there are delivering such children. But I had a particular case in Iganga where someone was abandoning a baby claiming it had been bewitched because of the lack of sensitisation on what causes this problem. 

So, I appeal to Government like the committee is observing to sensitise mothers and the communities about the causes of such complications. 

The other is on the provision of facilities. In Uganda, records indicate that we only have one institution, which is found in Mbale, where all cases in the whole country are referred, yet, there is no single support from Government that this institution gets. I want to appeal to Government that we provide some resources in the votes to this institution and even create more similar institutions in the country to ensure that we support these children in every way possible. 

The other way we can address the rights of children is the Children’s Act. I want to remind Government that the Children’s Act is obsolete; it is not applicable to modern times. We appeal to the Ministry of Gender to fast-track the amendment of the Children’s Act –(Member timed out.)

MS HUDA OLERU (NRM, Woman Representative, Yumbe): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the committee for handling this very important petition. I also want to thank Government of Uganda for reducing the number of people living with disabilities through immunisation programmes. Due to those programmes, the number of people living with disabilities has been reduced in this country. However, that is only one tool. Since there are other diseases, which cannot be immunised, especially this one in the petition, Government should take serious note. 

There is no one who has applied to God to be born with disabilities. They just find themselves in such situations; it is not their own making. So, Government must take the responsibility of giving care to such people. 

Currently, there are many problems in terms of nutrition and poor feeding in this country especially for the mothers and the young ones born to them. That is why children are being born with disability. Others are born normal but they develop disability in the process for lack of care from the parents. 

Therefore, I urge our parents to know that although the children belong to the state, the parents also have a responsibility to bring them up. Government cannot do everything for our children. (Member timed out.)

5.04
MS HELLEN ASAMO (NRM, PWD Representative): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to also thank the committee. One of the things that the committee did not look at is the issue of early identification. This kind of condition happens right from the time the mother is pregnant. So, the issue of maternal health is critical. But the issue of the Ministry of Health taking keen interest in early identification of all the children that are born is important so that we can identify the condition and arrest it before it is late. That is very critical. 

When we come to education, this is where we call upon special needs education. These children need assistance from childhood to adulthood. So, we thought the curriculum could be changed in a way that it favours these children. They have to learn issues like toileting; dressing; doing some small work. They cannot do an examination-oriented curriculum like the one that Uganda has. So, we need a curriculum that favours these children. It is also the role of Government to take care of assistive devices for people with disabilities including such children. 

About three weeks ago, I was in Butaleja District and we had to bring those children from Mbale Cure Hospital to give them wheelchairs. I have pictures to that effect. But I was asking, how much does Government give to that hospital? It is a private hospital and we need to call upon a public – private partnership to see how we can support these children. 

Poor parents cannot take those children to that hospital because you have to pay a lot of money for the operation and other things. So, we need to look at this area specifically because there are very many children with this kind of problem. And if their parents also hate them, then who will love them? 

5.06
MS JESCA ABABIKU (Independent, Woman Representative, Adjumani): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am a person with disability and I appreciate the offer you have given me. My emphasis is on Government focusing on prevention. Once you are disabled, your situation is very difficult to manage. So, I pray that where this can be averted, let us focus more on prevention. 

Secondly, on stigma, I heard the committee talking about sensitisation. There are two methods that I know that are perfect in this regard: one is in-ward building. When you are disabled, you must accept what you are. This should start from the family. If the family disowns a child with disability, the child will easily put up the spirit of rejection. So we need to convert their biological families before we convert the external family. 

On cost implications, I wish that we had a ministry; because we live everywhere. Even in Parliament, when the lift jams, I ask myself, if it is this hard in this august House, what about those down in the villages; those crawling where there are no path ways at all? 

Lastly, on rehabilitation centres, my colleague has talked about extensive centres. There is one in Katalemwa. One time, the children’s forum took me there. I went there and counselled the children who are taken there. But that centre can only be managed by the haves; the have-nots cannot use that centre. So, can we rehabilitate – (Member timed out.)

MR JACINTO OGWAL (UPC, Otuke County, Otuke): Mr Speaker, I would like to address the issues of mobility. Most of the children who are disabled especially in rural areas – and this is a critical problem – do not have common things like wheel chairs, shoes and crutches.
 
My proposal is that, as Parliament, we should come up with a special budget that will be specific to solving this challenge. This budget, when allocated to a particular ministry, Members of Parliament could be allowed to get involved in supplying these mobility accessories.

Secondly, I have also noticed that H.E, the President is very keen on giving out very expensive vehicles especially to our church leaders – the bishops and so on – but could it also be possible for the President to pay special attention to this matter? I am convinced and I know that all these major churches are capable of mobilising funds from abroad to provide vehicles for their leaders. 

Therefore, can’t these funds be redirected to this special category of people? Churches should also make it a priority by ensuring that the poorest of the poor and the most disadvantaged are taken care of?  There are organisations that take care of those bishops. Thank you, Mr Speaker.

5.11
MS MARGARET BABA DIRI (NRM, Woman Representative, Koboko): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the Committee on Health for giving this detailed report on this petition.

Producing a child with a spinal disorder is very scaring to the mothers. Many of them run and abandon the children. When the mothers come for antenatal, they must be sensitised about all these issues – that one can produce a child with a disability, the child can be born dead or born healthy – so that when a child with disabilities is born, the mother should not abandon but take care of it. This is important because the problem is caused by the mother, maybe by taking excessive drugs or failure to feed well. So, the child will be born with disabilities.

Mr Speaker, spinal disorder is a very severe disability and expensive to take care of such a child. I urge Government to always support such families that cannot afford to get the treatment required. They cannot afford to purchase the wheel chairs and orthopaedic appliances required.
Parents of such children should be considered for special funding so that they can ably take care of these children. In developed countries, parents are given money to help such children and they are not very many. That is why I urge Government to support such parents.

When it comes to schools, there is a policy that schools be built with access roads for disabled children. However, when it comes to building, the builders will not do that. Planners should ensure they provide for rams and rends for disabled children who might be going to those schools.

5.13
MS SARAH NYIRABASHITSI MATEKE (NRM, Woman Representative, Kisoro): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would also like to thank the committee for presenting a good report. I would like to however focus more on prevention.

In all our good government hospitals, folic acid tablets are available. So, it is unfortunate that most of our mothers, after the first and second births, attending antenatal classes becomes very hard. I think the ministry should do more sensitisation to avoid the complications that children get especially at birth.

I also would like to request the Ministry of Gender; surely, if the person is deep in Kisoro – about 500 to 600 kilometers away from the city, where can they get the wheel chairs from? That is important for them to know because what they think is that the wheel chairs are just imported.

Finally, Mr Speaker, we really need this Children’s Act. I will give an example. In Kisoro, there are diseases that I have not heard of anywhere. For example, we have diseases like Gapura and another called Butebure where they remove the glands of children and in case of any accident happening, the child will die. So, who is there to protect these children? And the most annoying thing is that they sometimes do it near the hospitals.

I have tried to beg Government to help us arrest these people; they go and convince these children’s parents to remove them from hospitals after knowing they suffer from such and they go to remove the glands. The point here is that any slight mistake can lead to the child’s death.

Finally, we have schools for people with disability especially the deaf. But in districts where you find – (Member timed out.)

MS ROSEMARY NAUWAT (NRM, Woman Representative, Amudat): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I also would like to thank the committee for their report. Now, the committee pointed out the lack of accessibility to mobility materials, for example, the wheel chairs and walking sticks.  However, a few weeks ago, we visited the Orthopaedic Unit at Mulago Hospital and saw those mobility materials. The problem is that they are given out on the basis of cost-sharing, yet, most of our people cannot afford to pay that money. So, there is need for this policy to be reviewed so that children with disabilities can acquire some of these items free of charge; they are quite expensive.

In the prayers, the committee is asking Government to reinstate measures for the promotion of access to treatment. But I still think that prevention is the best option.

There is need for us to encourage the mothers to go for antenatal clinics although most of the health units are far from the people and very many mothers cannot access them.

My appeal to Government is for it to procure mobile clinics so that they can handle this matter even in the villages but also follow up on these children. This is important because most of the time, information about these children is usually hidden. This is owing to the fact that some communities think they are a curse and that is how they miss out on medical attention.
 
There is need to sensitise these parents about the need for those children to go for medical attention and enjoy the right to education. Thank you.

5.18
MR JACK WAMANGA-WAMAI (FDC, Mbale Municipality, Mbale): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I also would like to join the rest in thanking the chairman for his report. But I am also glad that the Minister of Health is in the House. 

I want to remind this House that I lived in Sweden. While Dr Ruhakana Rugunda lived in Orchard, I was in Stockholm. In that country, people with disabilities are taken care of. They are put in a special home from where they are looked after.

What is the problem in this country? We have the money, which is stolen instead of using it to take care of these unfortunate people. At times, Mr Speaker, I read in the newspapers about people with deformity asking for Shs 30 or Shs 20 million to go for an operation. But we have a whole Government and these are unfortunate people. When you talk of antenatal care, some of us who come from hilly places like my colleague from Kisoro, people who live on the slopes of Mt Elgon, do not have access to medical facilities for antenatal care. It is a nightmare, you cannot believe that somebody who gets an accident up there or a mother who has failed to deliver using local methods is put onto poles and a blanket and is carried by four people. So, you can imagine from a hilly place like slopes of Mt Elgon, Kisoro, Bududa, how do they access medical care? 

These are some of the issues we should think about when we are legislating for the child and for the PWDs. I want to tell you that one time, I went to donate and may the soul of Dr Mallinga rest in peace. I took my late mother who had broken a hip to hospital and there was no wheelchair in Mbale Hospital and before I became MP, I went and bought wheel chairs to donate to Mbale Hospital. The medical superintendent was trying to refuse. Dr Mallinga said, “No.” I just received the wheel chairs. I want to tell the Minister of Health as I speak now, I brought in beds and mattresses that I would like to go and donate to hospitals. I do not want these RDCs to come by and say, “Wamai is FDC and therefore, he should not donate these things to the hospital.”
 
These benefit our people, the unfortunate ones. We have got PWDs in Mbale and I am glad my MP who takes care of that talked about it. These are unfortunate people and how much do these walking sticks and wheel chairs cost? Can the government come out and assist these people? We know that the lucky ones go to South Africa, India and Nairobi when they fall sick. (Member timed out.)

5.21
MS FLORENCE MUTYABULE (NRM, Woman representative, Namutumba): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I want to join my colleague to appreciate the report presented to us and I would like to say that the report informs us that there is no proper data on children living with Spina Bifida. However, it says there is a birth defect register. I would like to know at what level are these children registered. We are all aware that these children are born with this defect.
 
Do they get them when they go to hospital; do they get them on the streets? I would like to suggest that the birth and death registration legal framework should be put in place so as to be able to fast-track children living with Spina Bifida. This will also help Government to effectively plan for this unfortunate group. Thank you very much.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, can I have the minister make a statement on this issue?

5.29
THE MINISTER OF HEALTH (Mr Ruhakana Rugunda): I propose my brother who is in charge of PWDs makes a statement and then, I will conclude with your permission.

5.30
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR GENDER, LABOUR AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT (ELDERLY AND DISABILITY AFFAIRS) (MR SULAIMAN MADADA): Mr Speaker and colleagues, as you may note, issues of disability are cross-cutting; they are not only in health, they are in education, leisure, works and transport and this is the very reason this government has put in place an institutional framework, a Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development. Part of our mandate is to protect and promote the rights of the vulnerable through social protection and social economic transformation. 

I want to thank the committee for the observations made and you are very right to have concern for persons with disability. I want to let you know that according to the current household survey report 2009-2010, we are talking about 16 percent of the population as being PWDs. The government is, therefore, concerned about these issues being raised and yesterday, I mentioned here that at Cabinet level, we have already approved a Bill on PWDs. We have been having an Act, which was initiated in 2006.
 
It was a Private Members’ Bill. And in the process of implementing this Bill, we found a lot of challenges. So, as a way forward, we agreed to repeal this Bill and what is coming in this Bill, part of the issues of government equipping services like schools, hospitals with facilities that will help PWDs have been provided for. I call upon Members, when it comes to this level, please, support it strongly. 

But I also need to let you know that a number of interventions are being made under issues of rehabilitation centres. We are now shifting from bringing PWDs into centres by taking them to communities under a programme called community based rehabilitation in order to stop discrimination. 

Under that programme, we would like to expand to all districts. The new policy on elimination of child labour and the action plan has serious issues on disability – we will share that action plan with you here. In terms of data, I realise we do not have strong data but as a ministry responsible, we are engaging other government departments including the Minister of Planning, and as we prepare for census we have created a unit where we are interacting with the ministry that is going to call on census to ensure that issues to do with disability are captured during that census. 

We would also need to know, and I want to call upon you colleagues, that when we talk about the national ID card, part of the objective is to create a national data bank and each person will have a national Identification number and my ministry has engaged the Ministry of Internal Affairs in that questionnaire to make sure that issues of disability come out with their categories such that the data will be captured. The first phase is capturing people who are 16 years and above but after elections, there will be a second phase starting with zero years to everybody and we want to capture all that information regarding PWDs and their deformities in the facts that will be taken. 

In terms of raising awareness - and I am happy that the committee is talking about engaging civil societies - we are sure today, we cannot be a monopoly of development –(Interruption) 

MR WAMANGA-WAMAI: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I thank the minister for giving way. When you collect all this data, what are you going to do? What will this information help you with if you collect all the data about PWDs; what plans do you have for these people? You better tell us instead of telling us you are going to collect data and information and you just leave it like that and move to another sentence.

MR MADADA: The committee here observes that there is inadequate data and for purposes of planning, if you do not have specific data, you will not be able to raise issues on budgeting. So, we need data for proper planning and facilities required. When we have inadequacies in data, we have a problem in terms of allocation of resources and planning. So, that is why we need specific data on that particular matter. 

Working with the civil society and other private partners; yesterday, in Hotel Africana, we launched a programme of raising awareness on disability and we are going to create what we call talent search in this country for all children who have talent and are disabled. 

What we intend to do is to get to districts. We have engaged a group of people; persons with disabilities that will bring out the music and creative arts in every district and that may result in a lot of employment. We are beginning with the Eastern region, with the area of Soroti on 4th to 5th this month in Mbale – that is in the next two days - and then Tororo and Jinja. 

All we want to do is to bring out those talents. We have realised that you can create a lot of employment from the creative industry and persons with disabilities do not have the capacity to come and compete in the open market. So, we are going to work with partners and we call upon Members to work with us when we get to that level.

Otherwise, there is a lot that we are doing. I cannot summarise it in this time but we will give a comprehensive report on what the ministry is doing in terms of engaging other government departments. Thank you very much.

5.29
THE MINISTER OF HEALTH (Dr Ruhakana Rugunda): Thank you very much colleagues who contributed to this discussion. I would like to thank the committee because I think they gave a very good report and the contributions from the Floor were extremely constructive.

I have a few comments on the issues raised on the Floor; the importance of prevention. This is a fundamental point because if we do not prevent some of these disabilities, it becomes almost impossible to treat them. Therefore, to the people who have raised this question of prevention, yes, it is crucial and it is in that respect that Government of Uganda has put a lot of effort on immunisation. One of the major causes of disability, Polio, has virtually been eradicated in our country as you know. It threatened us recently but we sent out teams to the border areas towards South Sudan and Kenya and fortunately the problem never came to Uganda.

Immunisation had slackened a bit in Uganda but I am glad to say that the reports released by UNICEF and World Health Organisation indicate that Uganda is the second best country in the region in terms of immunisation so there is really an improved performance from the preventive point of view and we believe that prevention is the cornerstone of health service delivery.

The issue raised also concerns the role of the family. When these people are born, they will always be part of the family. The families are distressed as hon. Baba Diri told us and sometimes parents run away. Therefore, it is crucial to sensitise and support the parents and I agree with the comments made that as Government builds capacity, Government has no choice but to support communities to be able to manage children with disabilities and children with Spina Bifida in particular.

The other issue that came up was mainstreaming disability and I think it is another very important point. Because of their disabilities, these children are psychologically tormented and unable to fit easily in schools and the like. So, some affirmative action by society, Government and by all of us must be taken in order to enable them to benefit from society by being able to look after themselves, being useful members of the society and reducing some of their handicaps because of their physical or mental problems.

The issue of mobility has been raised and it is a fundamental point. Indeed, wheel chairs and other related items and accessories should, as much as possible, be available either at subsidised or affordable rates.

My good friend hon. Wamai said he made a donation and it was resisted but I am glad that eventually, with the intervention of my late brother, hon. Mallinga, it was eventually accepted. We are waiting for the beds and mattresses. Tomorrow, we will be ready to receive them; so, your contribution is very welcome.

My sister from Kisoro says there are two new diseases that have appeared in Kisoro. We will work with her and with technical officers who are here to ensure that we follow it up and be able to establish whether these are really new diseases or new manifestations of some of the well-known diseases.

To conclude, Mr Speaker, let me agree with the comments made about registering. Registering of these patients; people with disabilities including Spina Bifida is crucial. From the very beginning, I think we should start in hospitals and health centres where they are born but we must also know that many children are not born in hospitals and health centres so we need an extension programme to be able to reach them. We can register them wherever they may be using our social structures; LCs, churches, mosques and other social groups. (Interruption)

MR WAMANGA-WAMAI: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the minister for giving way. This Parliament usually passes a budget for the Ministry of Health and when we go to international conferences, we pledge to attain the Millennium Development Goals as well as the resolutions of the Maputo Conference and Abuja Declaration that we are going to allocate 15 per cent to the Ministry of Health. 

With a place like Katalemwa, what plans does your ministry have? Why can’t you bring it in the budget so that we can help Katalemwa and those unfortunate children? 

I was waiting and you were coming to the end without saying something to help these people and that is why I intervened. I will thank you, Mr Minister, if you could tell us what your ministry can do for Katalemwa. I see your directors driving huge vehicles; land cruisers instead of restricting them and saying, “I want you to drive small vehicles so that some of the money can go to these unfortunate children at Katalemwa Home.”

DR RUHAKANA RUGUNDA: Thank you my colleague. Mr Speaker, I thought that instead of hon. Wamai quoting officials of the Ministry of Health, he would also include hon. Members of Parliament and the like.

The point that Ndugu Wamai is making actually brings me to a more critical point. Government plays its role but society also plays its role. Katalemwa is, to the best of my knowledge, because I have done some bit of work there, a Non-Governmental Organisation, which has been with us for quite some time and which specialises and focuses on looking after these children. Indeed, in that respect, the communities are playing their role to support Government and society in looking after these children. Therefore, the message is, Government, Civil Society Organisations, communities and families should complement each other and work together in unison in order to be able to stand and support our children and the people with disabilities.

On the question of budgeting, I agree with you that we should endeavour not to just talk about this important matter but to ensure that Government makes some reasonable funds available in some way to start and support this important sector and as time goes on, more and more resources can be mobilised.

In conclusion, I want to support the committee’s recommendations that we could, for example, start with regional centres to be able to deal with this problem. 

In fact, as we were told the other day, there are some regional centres for the blind, deaf and more such centres specialising in certain disabilities could be created as the country endeavours to solve this problem.

Secondly, the question of sensitization, especially on the rights of children and people with disabilities is a fundamental point. This will, indeed, reduce discrimination, violence against children who may be handicapped or disabled and also defilement, which is really terrible.

On the question of education and folic acid, this is a very important point. As we were told, folic acid is readily available to women during pregnancy and it is important when you are planning to have a pregnancy to begin even before the pregnancy taking folic acid so that when the baby comes in, at that critical stage of formation, there is already some reasonable reserve of folic acid and it is associated with reduction of instances of Spina Bifida. 

That is an important point and let us take prenatal or antenatal care much more seriously. Our ladies should at least go four times for antenatal care when they are pregnant. But these days, they go once and some of them do not go at all and they end up with complications, which lead to endangering their own lives and also the lives of the babies that are born.

So, once again, I salute this committee for a great report and on the basis of this report, Government, society and our communities should be able to take much more affirmative action to give an appropriate profile and treatment to the children born with Spina Bifida and to people with disabilities. I support the report. (Applause)

5.42
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON HEALTH (Dr Kenneth Omona): Thank you, Mr Speaker and colleagues. I would like to appreciate the interest and support that you have provided to the report of the committee. I just want to respond to one or two issues raised by colleagues. 

One was about the early diagnosis of Spina Bifida. As I stated earlier, on that, this is a birth or congenital defect that a baby is born with. I am very optimistic that if a mother produces in a health facility, the health worker therein should be able to examine the baby for this abnormality as it is required in the normal practice. 

However, I should also say that in very mild cases, this disability may not easily be diagnosed or detected by the health worker unless detected on an x-ray or something like that. But also, the good news is that in those mild forms, it could cause no disability. 

The only problems are the severe cases, which either present as a bulge or a tart of air or just like a birth mark along the spinal cord of a baby during birth or indeed, with the presence or absence of hydrocephalus – an inappropriately big head at birth. So, this must be done at that level. Also, registration should be done at that level. 

However, there are also cases that come after birth. There are those who deliver outside health facilities or in the hands of poorly skilled health workers. So, those cases are also available but I cannot say with a lot of confidence on the type of death that was captured in this case but those are the different scenarios.  

Finally, an issue raised by hon. Nauwat about mobile medical services in those areas that could help capture data - this is not to just pre-empt but my committee has just benchmarked on the use of mobile health facilities and I want to say that when we bring this, please give us the opportunity to present to this House a report on the use of mobile health facilities where you have qualified health workers going to an area and providing a service for a certain specific time. 

I hope that when we bring this report to this House with the opportunity and permission from the Speaker to present it, this House will adopt this.

I thank you very much, Mr Speaker. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much, Chairperson, hon. Ministers and hon. Members, for your very detailed discussion on the subject. The battle before us has been presented by the committee based on a petition. They have made a report and recommendations that they have asked this House to adopt. 

I will now put the question to the adoption of the report and the recommendations of the committee on this petition by children living with Spina Bifida. I put the question.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Report adopted.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Members, we have 15 minutes to 6.00 O’clock and I will alter the order paper to allow the Chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee to lay some urgent papers on Table and then, we see how to proceed from there.

EXTRACTS OF THE KEY FINDINGS OF THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE AUDITOR-GENERAL FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2013.

MS ALICE ALASO: Finally, the Auditor-General presented extracts of the key findings of the Annual Report of the Auditor-General for the year ended 30 June 2013. I suppose it is a summarised version. I beg to lay. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let the records capture that.

MS ALASO: I thank you, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. Hon. Members, we had a debate on the issue of where the report on Value-For-Audit should go. It was a discussion that was lengthy and we will be reviewing this later and taking an appropriate decision because it is clogging the work of the Public Accounts Committee and yet, this work would be reviewed by the sectoral committees, which are responsible for issues of value for the money they have been approving for specific sectors. 

We will be reviewing this and communicating appropriately as to whether this report on value-for-money audit should actually go to the Public Accounts Committee or should go to respective sectoral committees so that they deal with this at sector level and they report back to the House on the performances of those things. 

But for now, going by precedence, I now refer all those reports that have been brought through the Office of the Auditor-General to the Committee on Public Accounts to act on them within the constitutional framework. If it is necessary to assign special time to allow the committee handle this, that will be granted when such permission is sought from the responsible authorities. They are accordingly referred to the Committee on Public Accounts.

MS ALICE ALASO: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I do not want to appear to be dodging work but because it is the whole annual report, some of it should go to the other committees of COSASE and the Local Government Accounts. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, because I have just been reminded also that there is one on local authorities – that one will go to the Committee on Local Government Accounts and the one on statutory corporations will go to the COSASE. Thank you for that reminder. So, they are accordingly referred to those committees to handle expeditiously, except the last one on the value-for-money audit. For that, we will be taking appropriate advice in due course. 

Hon. Members, thank you very much for today. This House is adjourned to tomorrow at 2 O’clock. Thank you very much.

(The House rose at 5.51 p.m. and adjourned to Thursday, 3 April 2014 at 2.00 p.m.)
