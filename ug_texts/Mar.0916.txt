COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you to this afternoon’s sitting. I just have two pieces of communication, mainly to the newly elected Members of the Tenth Parliament. I have received information that banks and moneylenders have started chasing after them, inviting them to take loans. 

I would like to ask them to be cautious and do nothing until they have been sworn in and have understood issues pertaining to their emoluments. Even if they have problems, my sincere advice, which is from a very senior Member of this House, is that they should keep away from moneylenders and banks until they are settled.

The second communication is to inform you that taking of oaths by the new Members will take place on 16, 17 and 18 May 2016. The Clerk will issue notices on 13 May to all the Members, indicating which day they are to be sworn in because it is done under alphabetical order. Thank you very much.

THE SPEAKER: Again the Chair is not here. That was the business that we had planned for today but just to say that the Inspector General of Government is concerned that we have not had time to debate their reports. I would like to call upon the chairpersons to be available tomorrow because this covers a number of years and they would want to have our comments.

The other day, we received a report from the Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises. I think some of you were here. If you are ready to debate, we can do so -(Interjections)- you are not ready? How can you go for LC III elections instead of doing work here?
