BILLS
SECOND READING

THE ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT BILL, 1994

(Debate continued.)

MR KASAIJA KABUUBI (Bujenje County, Masindi): Thank you very much Mr Chairman. Permit me to contribute on this important Bill - the Uganda Environment. This Bill has been long overdue. It should have come in maybe, in 1989 when this House was expanded. (Interruption)

MR WASSWA NKALUBO:  Point of order.  Mr Chairman, in view of the importance of this Bill, is it in order for us to continue debating when we do not realise a quorum?

THE CHAIRMAN: It is not in order for us to proceed.  I, therefore, adjourn the Council indefinitely.  Thank you.


(The Council rose at 2.49 p.m. and adjourned sine die.)
