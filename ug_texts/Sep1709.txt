Thursday, 17 September 2009

Parliament met at 2.44 p.m. in Parliament House, Kampala.

PRAYERS

(The Speaker, Mr Edward Ssekandi, in the Chair.) 

The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you. In the gallery this afternoon, we have members of the new students’ Guild of Uganda Christian University, Mukono, led by their Guild President, Mr Martin Aliga and Speaker, Mr Emmanuel Elau. You are welcome. (Applause) 

From the Parliamentary Anglican Chaplaincy, I have received information about prayers and Holy Communion. Anglican members of parliament and staff are invited to the above service to be held today, 17 September, 2009 in the Members’ Lounge at 5.30 p.m. soon after the Plenary has ended. 

It is important that you attend; we need prayers this time when we have problems in our country. We also have our brothers and sisters who are having Ramadhan; we ask them to also pray for the country. 

Yesterday, I told you that the Business Committee thought that we should work Monday to Friday, but having said that, a number of you approached me and said that at least you should be given either Monday or Friday. On Friday, we are planning to sit in the morning, and on Monday, in the afternoon. Of Friday and Monday, which day would you like to have free? 

2.47
MS ALICE ALASO (FDC, Woman Representative, Soroti): Thank you very much. Mr Speaker, I think it is good for us to complete the business that we have and it would be good that we sit on Friday morning because then, those Members who are going to travel upcountry can make it back on Monday. So, we sit on Friday morning such that we are free to go in the afternoon and then take a free Monday. 

THE SPEAKER: Okay. That is agreed. 

MS ALASO: Last week we received a special address from the President of the Republic of Uganda and I would like to take note of the fact that you, Mr Speaker, assured the House that we would be debating this matter most probably next week. But as we wait for an opportunity to respond to a number of issues that were raised by the President in that special meeting, we would like to point out something that we consider very urgent and cannot wait until the time of that debate. 

This has to do with missing persons; persons who apparently cannot be traced. They are neither in the police cells nor in the wards in Mulago, and they have not been reported as dead. We are very concerned because going by the mode of arrests as we all witnessed in the media, it is possible that some people are being held incommunicado. So, we need the minister to come up and tell us who is in custody and why they are not being produced in courts of law within the mandatory 48 hours. 

We have also received conflicting reports of people who are reported to be dead. The other day, I think the President reported a number of about 14 people and yet we have also read from the electronic media and print media that there are about 24 and others actually claim that there are 80 people feared dead. So, who is telling the truth to this country? (Interruption)

MS NAMPIJJA: Thank you, hon. Colleague for giving way. There are also allegations that most of the people who were killed in Kayunga were dumped in Sezibwa and their relatives do not know their whereabouts. We need Government to come out and clarify on this. We need an explanation from Government. Thank you very much.  

THE SPEAKER: You mean R. Sezibwa? Dead bodies? Because when you say allegations, it is different from –

MS NAMPIJJA: Mr Speaker, I got some communication last night that people who were killed by Police and the Black Mambas were dumped in R. Sezibwa. So, we need an explanation from Government. 

MS ALASO: Thank you, hon. Nampijja. It is important that the Minister of Internal Affairs specifically clarifies on these issues and puts these fears to rest by first of all producing to us, the Parliament of Uganda, the casualty list. Because by now, our hospitals have casualty lists arising from these riots, and a list of those in custody and those who have been charged. By so doing, we expect that he will have accounted to this nation. 

Secondly, we are also aware that arrests are still going on. It is reported that in Masaka, arrests are still going on pending the Kabaka’s visit there, which we think is uncalled for. Nobody is rioting in Masaka right now, but people are being arrested. 

So, we demand accountability on all the people who were affected one way or the other. And most importantly, we would like to know who is being held in safe houses? Who is being tortured without being granted access to a lawyer and family? I thank you. 
  
2.53
MR MICHAEL MABIKKE (Independent, Makindye Division East, Kampala): Thank you. Mr Speaker, in addition to what hon. Alaso has said, we would not like to pre-empt the debate on the Presidential address but I think there are some issues which cannot wait. 

I rise on a point of concern that the Constitutional rights of the people, who have been arrested and taken prisoner, are being violated. I have got a case of about five people in my constituency and several others who have since Saturday, been held at CPS. Three of them are in grave condition; they are seriously ill. These are Makalo Kavuma and Sulaiti Mawanda. 

I went to CPS yesterday and pleaded with the O/C of the station. The O/C allowed them to go to Mulago and they were taken there. I followed them there. These are people with very serious ailments, but they were given only Panadol in Mulago and returned to CPS cells.

I have been pleading with the O/C to ensure that at least these people get bond because we know their homes; we know where they stay, but the O/C is saying that there is a Presidential directive that none of these people should be bonded. 

Mr Speaker, this is a very grave situation. You are going to have very many of these prisoners dying in prison cells. It is important that we urgently intervene. There is no way Police and even the Courts of law can act on a Presidential directive that violates Constitutional rights of prisoners or suspects. 

2.56
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr Kasaija Matia): Mr Speaker and honourable members, last week I was due to come to this House to make a statement on the events that took place in our country, but time could not allow. I would, therefore, wish to promise this House that – did I get it Mr Speaker that we are meeting tomorrow morning? I came in while you were making your address and I did not get you well, but I seem to have heard that the House is meeting tomorrow morning. I promise that tomorrow morning I will come with a situation report of what we have done; how many people we have arrested; how many have been produced before court; how many have died as far as our records are concerned; and we will give you a full picture rather than me giving you half an answer today. 

I would pray, hon. Nampijja, on that case that I am hearing for the first time and yet we have our ears on the ground, that people were killed in Kayunga and were thrown in R. Sezibwa. It would help me quite a lot if I could get the names before the end of today for my investigation and to take disciplinary action against any officer who did that kind of thing if at all it was done. Thank you. 

THE SPEAKER: And I would also suggest that with regard to the missing persons, I think the best way would be to submit a list and say these people are missing; do you have them or not? That is how we can know whether they are missing. Maybe they are not missing. So, I think we should have a list of those who think their people are missing. 

MS ALASO: Mr Speaker, I know you appreciate that it would be very difficult for us to begin compiling all those lists but it is possible for the minister to at least produce for us the list of those who have been arrested and those who have been produced in Court, the casualty list, the dead; at least he must have that somewhere. That could be a good starting point. 

As we go ahead, just like hon. Mabikke had already told us, there are specific cases that need redress. But also, normally when people are said to be in safe houses, it is not possible for you to access that information except through the establishment itself. 

THE SPEAKER: I agree with you, but if somebody complains that their person is missing, get the name and verify whether that person is with Police or not. But if you cannot get the names then he will ask, “who is missing?” and you will say, “I don’t know.” My view is that we list those people alleged to be missing. [Ms Kamya rose_] 

I think we have concluded that subject. 

MS KAMYA: Thank you. I am sorry I have just come in, but I found you asking for information about missing people and I have some people who are missing: Mr Abdala Matovu of Masaka, Mr Henry Lukwaya from my constituency in Lungujja - Kitunzi, Mr Francis Matovu Nsibirwa of Nateete and Lt Frank Matovu of Kasubi. 

And yesterday at 12 O’clock on Nasser Road, in a place called Printers Arcade, they took a person called Jimmy. He was wearing a T-Shirt with a picture of the Kabaka. His whereabouts are unknown. That happened yesterday at Printers Arcade on Nasser Road, and everybody can tell you that. He was just going about his business and he was taken. 

THE SPEAKER: I believe you are the students from Mukono University. I mentioned earlier that you were here but I think you were outside in the lobby. You are most welcome to Parliament. (Applause)

THE STAMPS (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2009

THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mrs Syda Bbumba): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would like to move that the Bill entitled, “The Stamps (Amendment) Bill, 2009” be read for the second time. I beg to move.

THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Gaudioso Tindamanyire): Mr Speaker and honourable members, The Stamps (Amendment) Bill, 2009 was laid on Table on 8 July 2009 and referred to the Committee of Finance, Planning and Economic Development for scrutiny. The committee has accordingly scrutinised the Bill and now wishes to report its findings to the House. 

Methodology

The Committee held meetings with the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and her technical team. The Committee also made reference to the Stamps Act, Cap.342.

The object of the Bill is to amend the schedule to the Stamps Act, Cap.342 relating to rates of Stamp duty.

Brief on the clauses

Clause 1

The clause provides for 1 July 2009 as the date the measures stated in the Bill come into effect. This is to coincide with the commencement of the financial year. 

Clause 2(a)

This purpose is to amend the rate of stamp duty on appraisement on valuation made to a rate of 0.5 percent of the total value. This however does not apply to the appraisement or valuation made under an order of court.

Clause 2(b) is meant to reduce stamp duty payable on bonds required by investment traders to secure tax from 1 per cent of the tax at risk, to Shs 50,000. 

Observations of the committee

•	Two rates of stamp duty are attached on item No.8 of the schedule of the Stamps (Amendment) Act, 2002. This creates an ambiguity as to which of the two should apply. It is, therefore, necessary to amend the Stamps Act to cure this anomaly. 

•	Reducing the stamp duty will make it non-prohibitive for prospective investment traders to be registered.

•	There is only one stamp duty station at Diamond Trust Bank in Kampala and this is very cumbersome. The number should be increased to improve service delivery.

Recommendations

The Committee has critically analysed the Bill and requests the House to pass it with a few amendments. I beg to move.

3.05
THE SHADOW MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Charles Oduman): Thank you, Mr Speaker and honourable members. I wish to guide Members that we have a document in circulation titled, “Opposition Response to the Bills.” The approach we will be taking is that when the Bill comes up we shall respond to a particular Bill. 

In our document we have sections and for this particular one, you have the relevant section on page 5. But before we get there, Mr Speaker, permit me to say the following: As you are aware, we walked out from the last session of the Committee of Supply on Wednesday, 9 September 2009 owing to what we considered as a breach of a fundamental principle of the right to be heard. However, the matters in these Bills are matters of law with far-reaching and lasting impacts on the lives of Ugandans. Therefore, it is in this light that we make this response to the Bills. 

On the specific matter on page 5, I wish to say that we do not have any objection to the principles and the amendment proposals are agreeable to us. I thank you. 

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much. The debate is open. I do not see any Members rising. No debate? [Hon. Members: “No”] Alright. The motion is that the Bill entitled, “The Stamps (Amendment) Bill, 2009” be read for the second time.

THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Gaudioso Tindamanyire): Mr Speaker and hon. Members, this is the report of the Sessional Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development on the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2009. 

Introduction

The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2009 was laid on the Table on the 8th of July and referred to the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development for scrutiny. The committee has accordingly scrutinised the Bill and now wishes to report its findings to the House.

Methods of Work

The committee held meetings with the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and her technical team. 

The committee received a memorandum from Johnson and Nyende, Certified Public Accountants. 

The committee also made reference to the principal Income Tax Act, Cap. 304; the background to the Budget, the Budget Speech and related literature. 

The object of the Bill is to provide:

1.	The exemption of the business income of persons derived from operating and managing educational institutions;
2.	The taxation of petroleum operations; and
3.	Related matters

Brief on Clauses

Clause 1 provides for 1 July 2009 as the date the measures stated in the Bill will come into effect with the exception of section 89(a) up to 89(h) which will come into force on 1 July 2007 –(Interjections)– yes, we shall make an amendment to that effect but that is what was in the Bill. The commencement date coincides with the financial year. 

Clause 2 provides for the amendment of Section 19 of the principal Act by introducing a comma after, “refreshment”, under (d) (2) in the principal Act. This is to enhance clarity and easy interpretation because the sentence, “While undertaking travel…” applies both in (d) (1) and (d) (2).

Clause 3 proposes amendment of section 21 of the principal Act to remove the minimum distance for agro-processing entities located at least 30 kilometres outside Kampala with regard to business income exempt from Income tax. 

Agro-processing entities in Kampala shall with effect from 1 July 2009 have their business income exempt. The business income exemption will apply to all entities in agro-processing irrespective of the investment location. This is meant to be an incentive to encourage persons to invest in agro-processing.

Clause 4 amends Section 22 of the principal Act by repealing sub-section (1) (e). This section provides 15 percent deduction on all tax payable by private employers who employ ten or more persons with disabilities. 

Clause 5 of the Bill amends Section 2 of the Income Tax Act that contains part (IX)(a), which provides special rules for the taxation of petroleum operations that was introduced last financial year.

Observations

There was an initiative in the Income Tax Act to provide affirmative action for persons with disabilities but it had negative implications on the countries’ tax revenue collection. The committee has amended the provision to tie it to 2 percent of income tax payable as opposed to 15 percent of all tax payable by a private employer. 

Currently, non-executive boards of directors are subject to pay tax under pay-as-you-earn system and yet they are not regular members of staff on a permanent establishment of an entity. Their payments are based on availability of business they transact. An amendment in this regard may be studied and considered next financial year as it has financial implications on the 2009/10 national budget. 

Despite the fact that mortgage schemes are now commonly used in financing construction, government is still taxing mortgage interest repayments. As is the case of taxation on payments of non-executive members of boards, above this may be studied and addressed next financial year. 

Recommendation

Mr Speaker, the committee requests that the House adopts this report and pass the Bill subject to the following amendments. I beg to move.

3.26
THE SHADOW MINISTER FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Charles Oduman): Thank you, Mr Speaker and hon. Members. First of all, on clause 3, we commend government for adopting our recommendation for last financial year to apply the tax principle of fairness and allow agro-processors within a 30-kilometre from Kampala to benefit from income tax exemption. 

On clause 4, we agree that some incentives are indeed necessary for companies that employ disabled people; however, we also agree with government that the best form of incentive is not a tax incentive to the company. We recommend that government considers other effective, affirmative interventions for the disabled such as supporting cottage and road side enterprises targeting the - that is one of the major intentions we have in the Bill. 

We are also recommending that we repeal Section 22(1)(e) rather than reduce the amount claimable from 15 to 2 percent; we should repeal it altogether. 

Mr Speaker, this is a situation where a company that can employ people at lower grades in the scale is allowed to claim a percentage of their income tax as relief. If you consider a company making billions of money, they may recruit the disabled at a low scale. Each one of them may be paid Shs 50,000 or Shs 100,000 and that is Shs 1,000,000. But the claims these people take in the name of the disabled will be in millions. These people will make money in the name of the disabled. 

Disabled people have been used and abused by employers to benefit their companies by employing ten disabled people and claiming billions of shillings in benefits. We agree with government to abolish the incentive. 

MR NDEEZI: Thank you my colleague for giving way. As a result of the old law, right now we have more than 30,000 persons with disabilities who are employed under this provision of the law. And 30,000 persons with disabilities is not a small number considering that before we enacted this law, these people had no jobs, no means of livelihood; they had nothing. 

Therefore, I would like to inform my friend that this law has helped us to have these people employed. I would also like to remind my friend that looking at paragraph (b) of Article 35 of the Constitution; this Parliament is required to make laws appropriate for the protection of the people with disabilities. If we delete this law, we would be doing the opposite of what the Constitution requires of us. If we delete this law, it means that the employment opportunities for the 30,000 people I have mentioned will no longer be guaranteed. 

Therefore, I request my friend that after getting this information, please support the amendment which had the effect of healing the whole problem and also of ensuring that we retain what we are required to do by the Constitution. Thank you very much.

MR ODUMAN: Thank you very much for the information, hon. Ndeezi. Mr Speaker and hon. Members, we are deeply concerned about this category of people, and we are making these proposals in good faith that they may not be used by people who make huge sums of money in their name. 

The best way this can work is in a situation where we have a minimum wage law. Once we have a minimum wage regime, we can risk and say, “If the minimum wage is Shs 500,000 and a company employs ten people, then you can know that these people can go away with Shs 5 million. But the way it is, companies have abused this provision and I think the Minister of Finance must have seen the point in repealing this clause. So we agree with government’s original proposal to repeal this law and we advise our colleagues to join us and protect the people with disabilities. Rather than reduce from 15 to 2 percent, we repeal the section altogether and urge government to come up with effective mechanisms to empower these people. 

Let us ring-fence cottages and roadside businesses and put there money. I think this is workable and it is for the good of those people. Thank you, Mr Speaker.

3.33
MR SANJAY TANNA (Independent, Tororo Municipality, Tororo): I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity. Mr Speaker, having heard the suggestion from the committee and having heard the position of my colleague here, I think we need to strike a balance because what the shadow minister has just said is extremely accurate. 

I want to bring this in terms of figures. The top 100 taxpayers pay slightly over Shs 1,300 billion. These are the likes of Uganda Telecom, Warid, MTN, Nile Breweries and so forth. And these are companies that can employ ten disabled people for any job. If you calculate 2 percent of that taxation that they would be submitting, it would not be equivalent to the help that we would give to the disabled people in this country. 

So I want to suggest that the figure of ten be allowed for only small and medium enterprises and then the figure be increased for the large taxpayers. I would like to suggest that we increase the balance. Maybe for the large taxpayers we could raise it to 25 people. Otherwise, ten is good enough for small and medium enterprises that can be easily identified by URA. I beg to submit.

3.35
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mrs Syda Bbumba): Mr Speaker and hon. colleagues, I wanted to give information only that it is now late. Anyway, let me make a submission on the administration as made by my colleague. By setting different categories for the tax ceilings in respect of employing people with disabilities, I would wish to submit that this is going to be abused more than what we have now.

First of all, categorising these taxpayers is going to be a problem. There is need for a balance in order to retain those who have already been employed under the old incentive regime – we had agreed to the proposal made by the caucus of people with disabilities to reduce the percentage from 15 percent to 2 percent and/or 10 percent or 5 percent of all employees of the company. 

Anyway, I would like to congratulate my colleague on the other side for supporting the government proposal to set up a special fund for income generating activities for people with disabilities.

Mr Speaker, government is setting up a fund that will be based at the district purposely to empower people with disabilities, economically.

We are putting it at the district because that is the grassroots of our people with disabilities. So, far from government incentives to people with disabilities, I can report that some of the people in this category have managed to acquire higher education and can qualify to get jobs on merit. However, those who are most deserving live in the rural areas; I believe these will benefit a lot from this fund.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would like to ask the colleagues from the finance committee to agree with the shadow minister of finance. Let me give you an example. Assuming somebody made Shs 50 billion to be paid as tax – 16 percent of that is Shs 8 billion. So, assuming he has employed ten disabled persons and is paying each Shs 100,000, it means that he spends Shs 1.2 million on each person per year. That also means that this person will spend Shs 14.4 million, in total, a year. From this I notice that we would have lost money in the name of the disabled. My suggestion is that we rather collect this money – (Interruption)

MR TINDAMANYIRE: Thank you for giving way. I would like to inform the House that we should be realistic to the people with disabilities. In the Act that we passed, we used the phrase “tax payable to the organisation” and as of now, government has included it in the income tax. What I am saying is that it is not true that all the money made by that organisation is going to have the 15 percent. I would like to emphasise that we have only related it to the income tax.

Secondly, we are saying that when we get to the Committee Stage, we should have 2 percent and 5 percent of the employees of that company. So, we are not losing everything. What we are saying now is that we should go for income tax.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: I think you have made my case because what we are saying is that big entities make income tax that can reach Shs 100 billion, pay 30 percent of that. In other words, even if it is Shs 1 billion of tax, that has been allowed and you have paid our people only 14.4 million, it does not make sense.

What we are saying is let us collect taxes, get part of the money collected and put it somewhere for the disabled to run their programmes, other than other people getting tax benefits on behalf of the disabled. If the benefits were going directly to the disabled, we would be happier; assuming the money to be paid by the organisation is shared by the disabled - the problem is that this one is only allowed on the company.

I would like to propose, as the minister talked of the upcoming fund, that we put aside a percentage on our taxes, say 1 percent, and channel it to the fund for the disabled. What I am saying is that we should first collect all the money; we can deduct percentages that will see the disabled benefit. This will help get out of a situation of using a few people to the disadvantage of the disabled. By the way, they can pay them while they are not at their places of work. They can tell them to stay home and just come to get tax benefits. These are people who are doing externalisation of our resources.

MR EKANYA: Mr Speaker, I would like to seek clarification from the chairperson. He talked of 2 percent and 5 percent of the employees –(Interjections)– yes, but it is in the report. Can you please check? I think it is a typographic error.

MR KAWANGA: I would like to seek further clarification from the chairman of the committee. The first sentence under clause 1 provides for 1 July 2009 as the date. The measure stated in the Bill will come into effect with the exception of Sections 89(a) to (h), which will come into force on 01 July 2009. I would like to ask the chairman to explain to the House what this clause means.

MS KAMYA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. While I agree with the arguments very ably presented by my colleagues, especially the shadow minister, I would like to know whether – or before I ask that - I would like to say that there is a lot more value in a person leaving home to go and work. Such people gain skills, self confidence and get opportunities for training. 

I wish, while I agree with all these, to say that we should address the question of providing wider opportunities for these people when they are at work. But when you put in there a fund for people to just get money, what skills do they have to enable them use this money? For a person to go and work and pay fees for his children – to hold a job - is a very important thing. So I would like to encourage my colleagues to argue in the line of maybe securing more jobs for such people rather than just emphasizing funding. I notice that most of these programmes do not even reach the people; they never reach the people! They just end up in the bureaucracies, the people managing the fund and their relatives. So if you provide jobs for people – there is nothing like a job for self esteem and confidence and for all that the person needs beyond bread, butter and shelter. That is the clarification I wanted to make. Thank you.

MRS SAFIA NALULE JUUKO (NRM, Persons with Disabilities): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would also like to thank the honourable minister, and the chairperson of the finance committee. 

I just want to start from where hon. Beti Kamya stopped. I think this debate is very lively and an eye-opener to all Ugandans on the status of employment opportunities for persons with disabilities.

You know, this just didn’t come as a surprise; it has a genesis. I am saying this because we started with the persons with disabilities not receiving education. Now with UPE and USE together with the provisions in the Universities and other Tertiary Institutions’ Act, we are seeing a number of persons with disabilities getting educated. 

However, when it comes to getting a job, persons with disabilities will apply for a job, they will get short listed, but when they appear for interviews and are seen walking on crutches or moving in a wheel chair, doubts over whether those persons are the one they short listed will arise. At that stage the person with disabilities will be denied the chance of even just doing the interviews.

What I am saying is that by introducing this provision into the law, we will be protecting the rights of persons with disabilities at work places. If you listen to what the shadow minister was saying, you realise the attitude – he is saying that the proposal is getting persons with disabilities doing some jobs in the industries, which is good. However, I think there was something on roadside enterprises. Don’t we really qualify to do better enterprises than just roadside enterprises? That shows that the attitude is still negative. 

On that basis, I would prefer that we go with the statement in the report of having the taxes reduced from 15 percent to 2 percent although I would like to say the percentage of such people getting employed should rise to 5 percent.

On the other problems of for example seeing whether the work environment is accommodative or not, I want to say we should move to that stage later. Anyway, I would like to thank the honourable minister for putting up additional support of Shs 30 million per district. That is why I am saying we should start from there; I am sure we will learn from experience.

MR ODUMAN: Mr Speaker, I need to make this clear. Our proposal was raised in an extremely good level of faith owing to what we have seen happen out there. 

I would like to add that when we proposed these industries, we did not mean to limit everything to those industries. People with disabilities are very close to our hearts. Before we came out with this proposal, we had to caucus over it for a long time. Well, it depends on the level of the disability, Mr Speaker, because these levels differ. We cannot rule out the fact that the sort of enterprises we suggested could be useful to certain categories of people with disabilities; we did not restrict that these should be the only enterprises that government could put up.

But we also agree to the fact that with the current levels of education, many other jobs could be availed to them. Our concern is about exploitation by the big corporate companies. Out there, it is a big incentive to claim big monies in the name of these people. So when we raised this matter, it was not that we were coming out with a certain attitude. I beg Members, especially our colleagues representing people with disabilities, to understand that we mean well for them. We hope that in certain instances it will be very good for them because most companies will find that as an incentive. Otherwise, we cannot rule out instances where capitalistic organisations will want to use that to benefit themselves.

Mr Speaker, we cannot determine at what levels these people will be placed in the hierarchy of these organisations because there is no minimum wage. 

If I have a big company making good profits, I just need ten of them earning Shs 50,000 each to get away with billions of shillings. We raised this in good faith. I would like to believe that the benefits of retaining this clause will be about 10 percent with 90 percent being exploitative of people with disabilities. I thank you, Mr Speaker.

3.50
MRS THEOPISTA SSENTONGO (NRM, Workers’ Representative): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would like to support the position of the committee and that of the minister as well. I am saying this because this very arrangement is being practiced in other countries and it is working very well.

To talk about what the other colleagues fear - this means that government has to be at a level of increasing the mechanism of monitoring to ensure employers do not exploit people with disabilities. And this is being practiced in other countries. I think that is the only way. People with disabilities have been engaged in profitable and employable jobs. We should carry this amendment to help our sisters and brothers who are in this situation.

3.51
MR WILLIAM NOCKRACH (NRM, Persons with Disabilities): Mr Speaker and hon. Members, this is a very nice debate. I would like to criticise those who are proposing giving money; it is like giving fish to a person everyday. If you give me fish everyday, I will eat it and come back to you. But if you give me a fishing net and hooks, I will go to the lake and fish for myself. So, giving employment to persons with disability is very important; it gives them self dependence and helps them to enjoy life like others.

Let me narrate a story that happened to me one day. After passing science subjects very well, I applied to become a dental assistant. When I went for the interviews, the panelists asked me what had happened to my leg. I knew I had already failed the interview, but nonetheless, I told them I had suffered from Polio. The second question was how I got to know I had suffered from Polio when I am not a doctor. And when I told them I had been told by my mother, they asked whether my mother was a doctor. The next question was how I would operate a dental chair with this leg of mine in case emergences hit. Because I had never seen a dental chair, I had no answer and definitely I failed the interview. 

What I am saying is that much as my colleagues out there have academic papers that make them qualify for job opportunities in this country like others, the attitude is negative. But I think this law is good, colleagues. Let us try it out this financial year. If it does not work, we still have the mandate to amend it, come next finical year.

The other thing is that we had proposed an amendment to this part of the law to read “… two percent of income tax payable under this Act by private employers who prove to Uganda Revenue Authority that at least five percent of their employees on full-time basis are persons with disabilities.” (Applause) Because, if you dwell on numbers, it may be very difficult, but if we use percentages, it will help us because it will depend on the size of the organisation. I thank you, Mr Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, the Motion is that the Bill entitled, “The Income Tax Amendment Bill, 2009” be read the second time. I now put the question.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Motion adopted.

BILLS
COMMITTEE STAGE

THE INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2009

Clause 1

MR TINDAMANYIRE: Mr Chairman, in clause 1, sub-section 2 is amended by substituting the year “2007” with the year “1997.” The justification is that the Income Tax Act, Cap 340 already provides for the commencement of dates provisions of sections 89(a) to (h), which are special provisions for the taxation of petroleum operations as beginning from the 1st July 1997. Since new provisions dealing with the taxation of petroleum operations sections 89(i) to 89(q) are being inserted, they should have the same commencement date provided for under the Income Tax Act. The combinations of expenses under these provisions for the purposes of income tax will trace back to 1997 when the first activities in the oil exploration began. I beg to move.

MRS BBUMBA: Mr Chairman, I concede to the amendment.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, I now put the question to the amendment.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 1, as amended

THE CHAIRMAN:  I put the question that Clause 1, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 1, as amended, agreed to.

Clause 2

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that Clause 2 stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 2, agreed to.

Clause 3

MR TINDAMANYIRE: Mr Chairman, in clause 3(a) where there is letter “z”, which has sub-sections (i) to (vi), I would like to propose that in sub-section (i), the words “which the commissioner shall issue within 60 days of receiving the application” be inserted between the words “certificate of exemption” and the words “at the beginning of his or her investment.”

The justification is to enable URA have sufficient time to consider the application at the same time enable the applicant receive their verdict without much delays.

MRS BBUMBA: Mr Chairman, for efficiency, I support the amendment.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, I now put the question to the amendment. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

MR TINDAMANYIRE: Mr Chairman, in sub-section (iv), I would like to move that we delete the words “undertakes to fulfill” and replace them with the word “fulfills” immediately after the word “regularly.” The justification is that a certificate of exemption should be granted to business entities, which comply with the law rather than those that merely promise or just express intentions to comply with the law. Besides determining and undertaking to fulfill obligations under the law might not be that easy. I beg to move.

MRS BBUMBA: Mr Chairman, for purposes of blocking loopholes, I concede to the amendment.

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question to the amendment.

(Question put and agreed to.)

MR TINDAMANYIRE: Mr Chairman, we are introducing a new clause 5, which reads thus: “Regularly files return as required under this Act.” The justification is that this will enable URA to have a track record of all the financial performance of the applicant for income tax purposes. I beg to move.


MRS BBUMBA: Mr Chairman, I concede to the amendment.

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question to the amendment.

(Question put and agreed to.)

MR TINDAMANYIRE: Mr Chairman, in clause 5, which is now clause 6, I would like to move that we add the words “for that year of income” between the words “exemption” and the words “the Commissioner-General” in the now new clause, z(6). The justification is to limit the exemption to the individual years of income. I beg to move.

MRS BBUMBA: Mr Chairman, I concede; it is a minor amendment.

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 3, as amended, agreed to.

Clause 3, agreed to.

Clause 4

MR TINDAMANYIRE: Mr Chairman, on clause 4, we want to amend the clause as follows:

“Two percent of the income tax payable…” we want to introduce, “…two per cent of the income tax payable under this Act by private employers who prove to Uganda Revenue Authority that they employ five percent of persons with disabilities on full-time basis.” I beg to move.

MR ODUMAN: Mr Chairman, whereas we have argued with our hindsight to repeal this particular clause from the principal Act; and whereas the representatives of the people with disabilities have insisted that we maintain this clause, now we wish to make a slight amendment. We want to concede, but make a slight amendment at the end of that amendment, where it says, “…with disabilities on full time basis…” we add the following and say, “…five of whom are in senior management positions.” (Applause)- that is, out of ten -(Interjections)

Mr Chairman, we must get value for the incentive. These people should not just be taken to be employed in very junior positions. As I said earlier, these are people close to our hearts and once we give these companies taxpayers’ money and give them incentives, we must get the value from it. So, we propose, “…five of whom are in senior management positions.”

THE CHAIRMAN: You see! The problem you have is that this is dealing with private employers. In these private businesses in the countryside, how many senior management positions would you expect? You may find that the man is one and there is his son or brother. So, where do you get the five? Whereas -(Laughter)

Hon. Oduman, let us exhaust this. These are private employers; how many senior positions do you expect?

MR AMURIAT: Mr Chairman, thank you. I think that instead of having absolute figures we could probably attach a percentage to the senior management positions. I would like to propose an amendment to the proposal made by my colleague to have at least 10 per cent of the senior management positions go to people with disabilities so that if a company has 10 senior management positions, for example, one goes to people with disabilities. I think that way we are going to honour our people with disabilities. 

We also know that most of these people are not engaged in strenuous work by virtue of their disabilities and so if we are really a serious country and we are not just paying lip service to people with disabilities, this proposal is a good proposal and it will help our people with disabilities that, after all, have got qualifications. Some of them are well read to very high levels of education. So, why should we discriminate against them? 

THE CHAIRMAN: No, you see hon. Amuriat, this is a private enterprise - you will find that the managing director is the financial controller and the director of human resource or something like that. The idea of these private companies is to maximise the profit they make and so, they do not employ people in those high profile positions. This is the realistic position. I do not know.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Chairman, the reason we are raising this is that the moment you want money, the percentage we are going to give you is already public money and is supposed to have gone to our coffers but now we are giving it to you. The moment somebody has to benefit from public coffers, he must allow us to have a say in it. 

So, we are insisting that we should allow a percentage for realistic -

THE CHAIRMAN: Hon. Nandala, I am sorry but don’t you think the idea here is a person with disability getting employed?  

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: But what we are saying is that at least -

THE CHAIRMAN: And this is an attraction for these people to employ them. Why do you make it so difficult for them to agree? Why don’t we try it and see the results this financial year? 

MR KAKOOZA: I think I would like to supplement on what you are saying, Mr Chairman, that the principle of the private enterprises is to minimise costs so that they can get profits. The moment you deny them a chance to make a decision to do it, and you are forcing a law on them, it creates a problem in decision-making. If we force a law that says that I should do it and yet according to me I am not making much profit because if I should employ - it beats the meaning of privacy and the right of decision-making which is in the private enterprises.

MR MUWULIZE: I thank you, Mr Chairman. When we try to come up with a law to help people whom we really feel for, we must give them something achievable. When we talk about employers, not all of them have these other categories we are talking of such as senior management positions. But we can ensure that whoever is employing people with disabilities will at least help them achieve out of these. But when we start bringing in positions or managerial areas then we are not catering for the damage controls. I think what we are coming up with is something achievable and this one will be easy for us to monitor, I thank you.

MR BUTIME: The hon. Member is saying that there are no people with disabilities who are well educated like the Member of Parliament I am seated with here; can’t he take up a senior managerial position in Madhvani? Because this is the debate really - there are many Ugandans now who have accessed university and other tertiary institutions education. These people can be employed in private enterprises and companies. We are trying to avoid a situation where somebody will get money because they are employing coffee and tea girls, sweepers and watchmen. 

We are saying that if you are going to access this money - the minister here is talking about incentives to private enterprises and we are not talking about incentives to government. And I am saying that there are Ugandans who have gone to school, who can take up positions at a senior level.

THE CHAIRMAN: The point was do you expect these private entrepreneurs to have those categories of senior management? We are not saying that people with disability have no capacity but there is a tendency of you as managing director, hon. Butime, managing your business. Will you have five grades of senior management? That is the question.

MR BUTIME: In my enterprise I can have the resource management, isn’t it? I would have no problem with a human resource manager with disability. That is a senior managerial position. I am not saying that you should be a managing director; I am not saying that you should be the director of finance - but even finance, what is wrong with that?

MRS BBUMBA: Mr Speaker, for somebody to rise to a management position, they must have a beginning and really it is this beginning where we are putting a catalyst for the employers to recruit these people. Many people with disabilities have got high competencies and when they are recruited they work their way up but the biggest problem is at the point of entry and really this is what we are addressing. The NRM Government has been the champion in giving affirmative action to people who are disadvantaged by so many things and among them are the people with disabilities and it is in that spirit that I had agreed to concede to the amendment proposed by the chairperson of the committee to introduce the two per cent.

Previously, we had thought that the proposal to give a fund for promoting income generating activities would be sufficient but on second thought we realised that not everybody is going to be self employed. There are those who have benefited from the incentives of the NRM Government which have been extended to people with disabilities and they have gone to higher levels of education but they need a beginning; they need an entry point. I would like to inform my colleague, hon. Butime, that these people will not jump from the air, they need an entry point. I thank you.

THE CHAIRMAN: I think we have two amendments, the first one was the committee’s, but this was enlarged by hon. Oduman’s amendment of senior category. Let us dispose of this amendment by starting with the amendment requiring for senior managers which has enlarged the first amendment. I put the question.

A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, 
“THE INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2009”

THE SPEAKER: Bill passed. Thank you very much. 

Honourable members, we now have two Bills remaining on this order paper. At the same time, the Chaplain wants you to go and pray for us. I think we can handle the remaining two; the Finance Bill, 2009 and the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2009 tomorrow in the morning. It was agreed yesterday that we would be sitting from Monday to Friday but before we proceeded with this business, the House resolved that we work on Friday but we do not come on Monday. That means that Monday remains free for Members to be in their constituencies and start business on Tuesday.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Speaker, we have a gender meeting today for UWOPA. It is starting today and many of us have been invited as contributors. As you know, UWOPA is part of us and these are gender issues so we would plead that we do this on Monday so that we can deal with UWOPA today. 

THE SPEAKER: Sorry, I have not got you clearly. What is there tomorrow?

MS AOL: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Uganda Women Parliamentary Association is organising a meeting and we are reporting today in the evening. It is a residential training in Entebbe. It will really disorganise UWOPA if we are to have the House tomorrow. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: I see. So you say we continue with business and then come on Monday afternoon?

MR MUWULIZE: Mr Speaker, Monday is likely to be Idd El-Fitr and so we would rather proceed; otherwise we shall be at risk. I thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Okay, I suggest that because the Finance Bill, 2009 is more involving, we deal with the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2009 today so that we remain with only one, which we can deal with on Monday, if it is not Idd El-Fitr or on Tuesday?

THE VALUE ADDED TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2009

4.22
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mrs Syda Bbumba): Mr Speaker and honourable colleagues, I wish to move that a Bill entitled, “The Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2009” be read for the second time. I beg to move.

THE SPEAKER: It is seconded.

4.23
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Gaudioso Tindamanyire): Mr Chairman and honourable members, the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2009 was laid on Table on 8 July 2009 and referred to the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development for scrutiny. The committee has accordingly scrutinised the Bill and now wishes to report its findings to the House.

The method of work

The committee held meetings with the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and her technical team. The committee also made reference to the principal Value Added Tax Act Cap 349, background to the budget, the Budget Speech and other related literature.

Object of the Bill

The object of the Bill is to amend The Value Added Tax Act, Cap.349 to include; 

•	Services in the definition of application to “own use” by a taxable person. 
•	Add the supply of services to construction of agriculture, education and health sector construction to the list of exempt supplies. 
•	Allow the Commissioner-General of Uganda Revenue Authority to delegate powers to officers of URA. 
•	Provide for official secrecy. 
•	Include brokerage services in the definition of insurance services.

Brief on the clauses

Clause 1 provides for the date when the measures tabled in the Bill will come into effect. The amendment comes into effect on 1 July 2009 and this coincides with the commencement of the financial year. 

Clause 2 intends to amend section 10 of the Principal Act on the definition of supply of goods to widen and give clarity on the definition of supply of goods. 

Clause 3 proposes to amend section 18 of the Principal Act by substituting sub-section 5(v)(a) and 6 to include services to its own use. 

Clause 4 proposes new sections 67(a) and 67(b) to the Principal Act. This is intended to introduce a section 67(a) to the Value Added Act to allow the Commissioner-General to delegate any duty, powers or functions to any officer of the Authority during the execution of their official duty as provided for under the Act. The delegated powers will not include powers to compound offences.

Section 67(b) is being inserted to provide for official secrecy to persons employed by URA so that informational documents that come into their possession during the execution of this Act can only be disclosed to the extent as provided for under this VAT Act. According to the minister, the purpose is to protect taxpayers’ information.

Clause 5, the Second Schedule of the VAT Act provides a list of goods and services that are exempt from VAT.

The committee notes that there is a possibility of delegated powers by the Commissioner-General being abused and this could lead to substantial loss of funds. The committee has rejected the proposed amendment to clause 4 (67)(a).

The committee notes that there is a possibility of using clause 4 on official secrecy to deny the public access to information contrary to the Constitution and the Access to Information Act. The committee has rejected the amendment to clause 4 (67)(b).

The committee notes that Kenya and Tanzania have waived off taxes on mobile phones. This waiver could improve communication as more people acquire phones. The loss on sales of phones could be recovered from taxes on airtime. An amendment in this direction should be studied in the meantime and considered during the next financial year.

Recommendations

The committee recommends and requests the House to adopt the report and pass the Bill with the following amendments. I beg to move.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much. 

4.27
MR ODUMAN OKELLO (FDC, Bukedea County, Bukedea): Mr Speaker, in our document on page 3, there is the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2009. We agree with all the clauses except clause 4 where the government proposes to empower the Commissioner-General of URA to delegate and introduces official secrecy provisions. Whereas several explanations have been rendered, the driving need for this amendment remains unclear. We do not see a need for these proposals.

Delegation

We do not appreciate why delegation must be introduced. In other words, we are agreeing with the committee in the law. The Auditor-General has similar clauses regarding his office where the “Auditor-General” refers the person of the Auditor-General and there is no problem with this. We, therefore, remain sceptical about the delegation proposal and do not support the amendment. Responsibility must be firmly kept in the Commissioner-General’s docket.

Secrecy

The amendment seeks to allow any authorised officer to release documents that come into their possession only to the Minister, Auditor-General and so on, except court or the tribunal. This is strange to us and cannot be allowed. In fact, the first right of access to any of those documents must be court. We do not support this amendment. 

Apart from that, we propose the following additional amendments: 

a)	Amend clause 5(b) by making the listed eligible supplies zero-rated rather than tax-exempt. The justification is to allow maximum utilisation of input VAT and make construction cheaper for construction companies and the taxpayer. 

b)	There is Exhibit 1 in Appendix 1, which is authored by my senior brother, hon. Nandala-Mafabi, who is a tax consultant.

Exhibit 1 in Appendix 1 - to make civil works bridges zero-rated. The arguments are contained on page 6. It provides scenarios to explain benefits. Scenario one and scenario two - when you make supplies in this category zero-rated, it means -(Interruption)

MS ROSE AKOL: Mr Speaker, the shadow minister for finance is referring to a document, which we do not have. But for the benefit of the House and for us to follow, it is important to have this document. Is it therefore procedurally right for the shadow minister to refer to documents we do not have? 

THE SPEAKER: I thought he is reading a document, which was distributed to all of you -(Interjections)- I have heard some have, while others do not have. Can you make sure that those who do not have the document get it? 

MR ODUMAN: There are more copies, especially, for my sister from Bukedea.

In Appendix 1, we provide Exhibit 1 that demonstrates the benefits of making this particular provision zero-rated rather than tax-exempt. The benefit will be cheaper construction costs, cheaper roads and a lighter burden to the taxpayer if we are to carry out these constructions. That is in Appendix 1. 

The second amendment is on clause 5(c) to waive VAT on mobile phones and the justification that this will make mobile phones more affordable and accessible by our people and thereby improve communication. Mobile phones are indeed small computers. They are used to surf the Internet, E-mails, MS Word, MS Excel, Power Point and telephony. Computers are VAT-exempt and so should be mobile phones. The resulting increase in demand for airtime and related taxes will more than compensate for the one-off tax lost from the exemption on a mobile phone handset. Again, we demonstrate to you in Exhibit 2 in Appendix 1 where we calculate how a tax lost in exempting one mobile phone, which is bought only once, and the tax you collect from the airtime from that person who spends Shs 2,000 per week down there in the village. The incremental benefit in terms of revenue will more than compensate the one-off tax lost at the time of purchase of the handset.

c) Amend Section 28 (10) to remove discretionary powers of tax officers to grant a method of apportionment of input VAT where there are mixed supplies and we mean taxable and exempt supplies. The justification is that the existing discretionary powers have been abused, causing unfairness to the taxpayers and loss of tax revenue. 

Repeal Section 44(3) of the Principal Act. Where as Section 44(1) and 44(2) provide for payment of refunds by URA with interest. However, where delayed by URA, the next sub-section 44(3) introduces a limitation where entitlement to a refund with interest is removed if the claim is found to contain an error of at least only Shs 50,000. As a result, URA will always want to find an error of at least Shs 50,000 and they will. This will be an excuse to delay payment as much as they wish, and will deny them interest, thereby disadvantaging taxpayers who run businesses on borrowed money.

The law provides alternative mechanisms for dealing with errors. Section 65(5) and Section 65(6) impose double penal taxes if such errors are found. And, Section 59 of the Principal Act deals with false and misleading statements. These are enough deterrents and, therefore, introducing another limitation will be unnecessary at this time.

Recommendations

a) 	Delete clause 4.

b) 	Amend clause 5(b) to make the supplies zero-rated rather than tax exempt.

c) Amend 5(c) to include mobile phones by substituting the proposed replacement in the Bill for paragraph 1(v) with the following suggestion, and that suggestion includes at the end: “…and mobile phones, i.e. supply of computers, desktop printers, computer parts and accessories, and mobile phones.”

	Replace section 28(10) with: “the taxpayer may elect to use a standard alternative method for input tax credit where the taxpayer makes both taxable and exempt supplies.” Justifications are already in paragraph 12.

d)	Repeal section 43(3) which imposes a minimum error of Shs 50,000 as the threshold for URA to have reason to delay payment and deny you interest as already discussed above. I beg to move.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much.

MRS BBUMBA: I thank you very much. I would like to thank my good friend on the other side for the proposed amendments. Many of the things he is proposing here are a surprise to us who have not had time to study them. We have not had time to really internalise the effect they are going to have on our budget. Last week, we passed the expenditure side of the budget and any change on the revenue side means that we have to go back on the expenditure. We do not have that time; we are already late. 

Some of the things that my good friend here has proposed are not totally new; they have been tried before - like the zero-rating - and found to be wanting. There have been cases of forgeries on zero-rating and people claiming refunds for taxes which they never paid. I would, therefore, wish to propose that the amendments being proposed by my counterpart be studied, given time and will be considered in the budget for next year if they are found necessary. 

I would have been comfortable if my colleague had proposed corresponding revenue measures to fill in what he is proposing now. However, since he has not done that, and the fact that I have not had time to study his proposals fully, I would strongly oppose them and I request the House to reject them.  

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Thank you very much. This is Ramadhan and –(Interjections)- I am making a comment because of what the minister has said. This is Ramadhan and if the minister can come here and tell us that she does not know this, then it is very dangerous. We agreed in the committee to make these proposals, and they were forwarded to the Ministry of Finance. 

The majority of the proposals we are talking about have no tax implications; they are just streamlining the operation of URA. It is very dangerous where there are discretional powers; where you do not want to refund the taxpayer’s money on time; it is the fault of URA. These are laws to streamline the operation of URA. So, Mr Speaker, I am –(Interruption) 

MR OLENY: Thank you very much. I would like to thank my honourable colleague, Nandala-Mafabi, and also thank the minister for being frank. 

The information I want to give is that, even yesterday, we had a meeting as a committee with hon. Nandala and his particular point was the matter for discussion. As a committee, we did say that probably it would now be too late for the minister to look into this and have these changes effected this financial year, and we did agree. Hon. Nandala, you will recall that these were very good proposals - especially the calculation that you have provided - and we strongly supported them for further study and inclusion in the next financial year, honourable colleague.

MS FRANCA AKELLO: Thank you. I really want to appreciate the concerns raised by the honourable minister. Looking at the proposals made by the shadow minister, most of them as stated by hon. Nandala do not have tax implications. When the honourable minister was putting her case forward, I actually thought they were not made aware; I thought it was a surprise on the Floor of Parliament. Now that we are getting information from members of the committee that they were placed before the ministry and they had a look at it, I would beg that this House adopts the proposal. I thank you.

4.42
MR PATRICK AMURIAT (FDC, Kumi County, Kumi): I thank you. The Minister of Finance, by her own admission, is actually happy with the proposals made by the Shadow Minister of Finance. All she is saying is that she is unable to make a quick decision because of her inability to quickly conceptualise what the Shadow Minister put to this House this afternoon. 

Mr Speaker, my suggestion –(Interruption) 

MRS BBUMBA: Mr Speaker, it is a command of this House that when speaking to and addressing each other, we use polite language. My colleague holding the Floor is trying to use derogatory language to me. Is he in order to use derogatory language when I have been using very polite language while addressing my colleagues? 

THE SPEAKER: Parliamentary language should be – What was the offensive language? -(Laughter)– I want to find out the offensive language. 

MRS BBUMBA: Mr Speaker, the words he used were “inability to conceptualise” and “lack of ability to act promptly” and I think I am above that and my competencies are known. I am not equivalent to what he has suggested. 

THE SPEAKER: Okay. Be more courteous. (Laughter) 

MR AMURIAT: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I have always intended to be as polite as possible in my submissions. Surely, if whatever I said injured the reputation and the person of the minister, I wish to apologise. 

I would like to bring the attention of the House to the effects of having zero-ratings as opposed to tax exemption. I am Shadow Minister of Works and Transport and we have on several occasions come to the Floor of the House to decry the high costs of construction in this country. We have talked about the high costs of projects where contractors literally fleece money from the Treasury. You also know that the rate of construction in this country has slowed down substantially owing to the cost of construction material. What this means is that the turnover on cement, steel and other construction materials is low and, therefore, the taxes that are realised are reduced. I would like to appeal to this House to sympathise with the construction industry and to consider this. 

The argument that the minister has put across to the House is that we have already passed the expenditure and so, there is need for us to have matching funds to be able to finance Government expenditure. What I would like to say to the minister is that by taking the approach that has been suggested by the Shadow Minister of Finance, costs of road projects are going to come down and, therefore, the expenditure on roads will be brought down substantially. Remember that by lowering the cost of construction material, whether in terms of bitumen and stabilisation material like cement or lime, or whether in terms of having the cost of steel coming down, project costs are going to reduce and accordingly, expenditures will reduce. I do not see any worry for the Minister of Finance in as far as these expenditures are concerned. 

I would like to remind this House that we appropriated Shs 1.1 trillion towards the expenditure of the Ministry of Works and Transport. A bulk of this goes to road construction projects. I trust that if we took this wise decision even without thinking so much, this would save us a substantial amount of money as a country. So, for us to defer this case to the next financial year is merely losing an opportunity that we should take with both hands. 

I would like to appeal to the House that if the feeling is that we do not have enough time or if the Minister of Finance does not have enough time to study this proposal, the minister should be given a little bit of time - say this weekend - to look at the proposals by our Shadow Minister of Finance so that this country can be saved the much required money. 

For now, we are doing extremely badly. People who would plan to construct two to three houses in a year are no longer planning to do that. They just do part of the projects that they plan in a year. I think this would be a good saving. This would promote the growth of the construction industry and, therefore, more productions would be stimulated, and I think this would result into income to the government. Mr Speaker, I wish to plead with this House. I thank you. 

4.50  
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR HEALTH (PRIMARY HEALTH CARE) (Mr James Kakooza): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to give some information about the proposal and about what the minister said of the expenditure. As the current law stands, there are some taxes collected on phones. You pass that expenditure with the assumption that we have the money and we have to collect it. The moment you say that you are waiving, there must be an internal genesis, an amount which is involved, and a way in which you are going to recover. It is not a must, as proposed here, that if you waive 30 percent from the phones, it can be added on airtime and you can collect it. 

In addition to that, I do believe that for taxes that are agreed on within the region, it is the council of ministers of those states that agree upon those taxes. That is why the budget is read in tandem with other countries within the region. Thank you very much. 

4.52
MR ABRAHAM BYANDALA (NRM, Katikamu North, Luwero): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. For the last month or so, we have been engaged in the budget cycle. We have been discussing figures and eventually we supplied. By supplying, it means we know the source of income and then we go into the expenditure. I am surprised that my colleagues at a time after supplying, knowing those taxes are the monies which have been projected to do the work, now come and say “please remove these taxes”. 

I totally agree with my minister; their ideas may appear to be good, infact very good, but let us consider them next financial year. We have already supplied; let us be serious and careful when we make suggestions here. I thank you, Mr Speaker. 

MR ODUMAN: Mr Speaker, we made very clear proposals and I am very happy that the Minister of Finance, just before she moved out, had agreed to these proposals, and said they are good proposals, as echoed by my colleagues. However, the only worry was that these might have an impact in terms of tax revenue. 

I would like to assure you again, as some of my colleagues have done, that there is no immediate impact in terms of revenue from these proposals. I will take you very quickly through a few of them.

a) Delete clause 4. What is that clause saying? As the committee said, it is on delegation and secrecy. That is all. We go to 5(b), which says –(Interruption)

THE SPEAKER: Although I am not participating, I just do not understand; is it the entire clause 4?

MR ODUMAN: Yes. 

THE SPEAKER: If you delete the entire clause 4, which says the Director General delegates power, how do you expect the organisation to work from Mutukula, Yumbe to Lumino? Are you trying to propose the entire deletion of clause 4?

MR ODUMAN: Mr Speaker, thank you for that good question. I am talking about the one that provides for delegation on page 3 and the part that provides for official secrecy in case –(Interruption)

THE SPEAKER: Are you saying that the Director General should not delegate? How do you function in a public organisation like URA without delegating? I thought you meant parts of clause 4 but when you say the entire clause, I personally do not understand.

MR ODUMAN: Mr Speaker, if that is the case, I will leave it as proposed by the committee because we – (Interruption)

THE SPEAKER: No, you may have some ideas, but when you say “do not delegate”, an organisation like URA cannot function without delegating powers to staff to carry out certain functions. It would mean that where there is a director general, the director general would go to Mutukula to sign.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Speaker, the delegation they are talking about is different. In the law, there are powers which are delegated to all officers but in the law which they are coming up with, there are some powers which have to remain in the docket of the Commissioner General. If he is going to take somebody to court, for example, or there are some types of charges they have placed, I think the law is clear; but there are those which the law allows the officer at — (Interruption)

THE SPEAKER: I am just reading the first paragraph, hon. Nandala. It says: “The Commissioner General may delegate to any officer of Uganda Revenue Authority any duty, power or function conferred or imposed…” This is where I really come in; are you, for instance, opposing this?

MR ODUMAN: Mr Speaker, as we have argued in our proposal, we do not understand the merits of this proposal -

THE SPEAKER: Of delegation?

MR ODUMAN: The proposal of providing for delegation. So, what we want to exclude is the introduction of provisions for 67(a) and 67(b) that talk about delegation and official secrecy. The rest of the clause can stand as it is.

The other one we talked about is 5(b). We are saying instead of making them tax exempt, let us have them zero-rated. What that means is simply to allow the tax payer to claim his input VAT in the system. The moment we make it exempt, you cannot utilise your input VAT and, therefore, it has no impact on revenue. 

Now, 5(c) is about mobile phones. I again very quickly want to take you to the appendix. I beg your indulgence, Mr Speaker. On page 6, we show you how exempting a mobile phone from VAT is going to bring more money. In the calculation on page 6, we are  saying that assume a villager buys a mobile phone for Shs 40,000, you will lose some money immediately, and that is Shs 6,102, but then on page 7 –(Interruption)

MR BYABAGAMBI: I thank you, Mr Speaker, and I want to thank my colleague for giving way. The calculations on page 6 are based on the assumption that in case tax is reduced by a certain percentage, some people will buy. However, experience has shown that if somebody can afford to buy a phone at Shs 200,000 and you reduce it to Shs 180,000, there is nobody who will come in that bracket to buy it at Shs 180,000; it will be the same people. Therefore, it is an assumption; it is not automatic that reducing taxes on phones will result into an increment in the sales of the phones.

MR ODUMAN: Mr Speaker, before I go ahead on this, I will just respond to the honourable minister. It is about the price elasticity of demand. The question we must answer now is whether the price is prohibitive to a taxpayer; whether prices of mobile phones have caused some people not to buy mobile phones and whether if the price is reduced even by Shs 5000, there will be people out there that will rush to buy. If you say “no”, then why are there promotions in town where UTL reduces the price of mobile phones and you find stalls on the streets and everybody is rushing to buy two mobile phones for Shs 80,000? That shows you that the demand for mobile phones is price elastic - when you reduce the price, more will be bought. 

Indeed, when you move in constituencies, people will ask you to buy them mobile phones; why? It is because they cannot afford, and those are the people we want to reach out to. When we reach out to those and they afford mobile phones, in this calculation we are assuming that somebody who buys a mobile phone in a village will be able to afford at least Shs 2,000 of airtime per week. We then calculate this for you for one year and we show you the gain. It is all here on page 7. We are not using assumptions, Mr Speaker. 

Finally –(Interruption)

THE SPEAKER: Can we dispose of the motion then we postpone the committee stage so that you go and think about this because they are involved in amendments?

MR ODUMAN: Mr Speaker, I just wanted to allay the fears of my colleagues about the impact on tax. Again on that one, you are gaining money; you are not losing. 

d) Replace 28(10) with: “The tax payer may elect to use the standard alternative method for the input tax…” Again, this is choice. You are saying that the discretion was left to URA to choose and we are saying that in the past, it has been abused. We are saying, leave the discretion to choose a method of calculating his tax returns and keeping his accounts to the tax payer to elect. It should not be elected for him by URA. Again, there are no tax implications.

e) Repeal section 43(3), which imposes the minimum error of Shs 50,000. Mr Speaker, this is again a matter of law and the lawyers should guide us. You have one part of the law saying, if you make a mistake, you will be penalised double the tax which should be paid. That is a penalty in the law. If you make a mistake and you furnish false information, there is a penalty. 

Why are you saying now that if I make a claim and in that claim if I am entitled to a return, if you find out from my claim that there is a very small error of just Shs 50,000, you will be able to delay my payment; you will be able to deny me interest. You can delay as much as you want as a tax collecting entity. Why are we introducing another deterrent when there are other sections which deal with errors and wrong information? Why do we heap penalties upon penalties? 

So, these are innocent administrative amendments. The acceptance has been recorded and as the honourable minister said, the assurance we are making here, as you have already heard, is that there is no impact on tax. To postpone to next year will not add anything. These are administrative amendments we are making. I thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, the motion is that the Bill entitled the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2009 be read the second time. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE SPEAKER: As I have said, there are a lot of arguments that have come up here and I think I should give you time to go and consider them because the real law will be in the amendments themselves. So, think about and internalise these proposed amendments so that when we next reconvene, we go to the committee stage. I think it is fair to handle it that way. This will also enable you to go to Rev. Hamlet and pray. We need your prayers. 

We have agreed that because of UWOPA’s function tomorrow, we may not be able to meet in the morning. So, we had said Monday but Monday could be Idd El-Fitr although it could also fall on Sunday or Saturday. If it is not on Monday, then honourable members, I appeal to you to come and do business on Monday. If it is Idd El-Fitr on Monday, it will be a public holiday and there is nothing to do. If it is not a public holiday, please let us honour our undertaking that we work on Monday so that we clear this Bill and maybe the Appropriation Bill will be ready. So, let us meet Monday afternoon if it is not a public holiday.

I thank you very much for your time. With this we come to the end of today’s business. House adjourned to Monday afternoon. 
 
(The House rose at 5.05 p.m. and adjourned until Monday, 21 September 2009 at 2.00 p.m.)
