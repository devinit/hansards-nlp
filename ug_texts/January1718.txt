COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you to this sitting. As you can see, it is a sitting that was meant for a specific purpose. 

Given the importance of the matter at hand, I found it necessary to call this sitting at short notice. You will recall that on 20 December 2017, the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development in compliance with section 9(5) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 presented the Budget Framework Paper in line with Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament. 
 
At the time of the presentation, the certificate of Gender and Equity responsiveness was not availed as provided for in the Public Finance Management Act, 2015. This sitting has been called for the said omission to be corrected.

I, therefore, request that the sectoral committees should continue processing business related to the Budget Framework Paper as earlier directed and no interruption, whatsoever, should be entertained. Thank you.
