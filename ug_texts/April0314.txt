The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I welcome you to this afternoon’s sitting. We have several guests in the gallery; I will give you all their names in detail, but majorly, we have political leaders from Gulu - Chairman Mr Ojala Mapenduzi; hon. Jane Akello Odong, former Member of Parliament; hon. Norbert Mao, he is walking in, the President General of the Democratic Party. We have Mr Douglas Peter Okello, District Speaker of Gulu. They are here to observe the proceedings. We have religious leaders and I am still waiting for the full list of their names so that I can announce them. 

Accompanying them are the following delegations; Invisible Children whom we have read about, I do not know where they are seated. Please, stand up. You are welcome. We have International Alert, we have the Justice and Reconciliation Project - they are on the other side. We have Refugee Law Project, they are out there. You are all welcome. 

Hon. Members, you do not seem to be welcoming the guests. (Applause) We have Women Advocacy Network; you are welcome. So, I will be giving you the names of the religious leaders in full. We have Archbishop Odama; Bishop Johnson Gakumba, Archbishop Northern Uganda; Sheikh Musa Karil; Rt Rev Bishop Onon Owen; Rt Rev Bishop Macleod Baker Ochola. We shall be announcing other delegations as they come. 

Hon. Members, on Monday, I visited Quality Chemicals, a local company manufacturing ARVs and anti-malarials. I want to assure the Members here that they are a high standard work. It is one of the best facilities in Sub Saharan Africa. I appeal to Government to support them because they have been approved by the World Health Organisation and the Global Fund. (Applause) 

They have some challenges; they are not being given the necessary support to supply medicine within the country. Therefore, I call upon the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to ensure that Section 59, subsection (3) of the PPDA Act 2011, as amended, be enforced. It requires that, “The procuring and disposing entity shall, when procuring goods, works or services, provide for a grant of 16 per cent in respect to domestically manufactured goods in recognition or the value addition through the local economy as is expected.”

Secondly, I would want to appeal to the Minister for East African Co-operation to call on the Kenya Government to implement the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Kenya and the Government of Uganda on the supply of Pharmaceutical products by Quality Chemicals. This is because there was an agreement made between Kenya and Uganda to kick-start the implementation of the East African Pharmaceuticals manufacturing plan of action. 
So, we have a plan of action in East Africa and the Kenya Government is not complying. So, we want to ask the Minister for East African Community to call on the Kenyans to fulfil the Memorandum of Understanding and purchase from Quality Chemicals as per the agreement. We also ask the Minister of Trade to ensure that local industries are not frustrated but are given encouragement to operate and grow within the country so that they provide employment and the much needed market that we all require. 

I hope that those ministers will be able to handle those issues. I will be following this up with letters to ensure that the necessary is done. 

There were some Members who had some issues to raise, I am giving them one minute each.

2.48
MR TONNY AYOO (NRM, Kwania County, Apac): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise on the point of national importance. As the country is witnessing change of weather from dry to wet and rainy season, the rain we are receiving is coming with many problems. On Tuesday night, Uganda College of Commerce, Aduku, witnessed heavy rains that came with a storm and blew off the roof of one big block, which is housing two big lecture theatres and two computer labs. The roof was blown off completely, the computers were washed away and right now, the college has suspended learning and lectures on some of the programmes. One is Computer Training and the other is Department of Business and Development. They are trying to teach under trees. 

Another problem is that as they are trying to organise lectures under trees, there is also rain and they are being chased from here and there. 

My request and appeal to Government, especially the Ministry of Education and Disaster Preparedness is that we need an immediate emergency response to ensure that learning gets back to normal at Uganda College of Commerce, Aduku. We need iron sheets and timber so that the roof is fixed because another problem is that the college has got very few structures; if this continues for months, you know what the students can do. 

My prayer is that Government takes this as an emergency. This has not only happened to my constituency. Yesterday, we experienced the same problem in Butaleja, where we had hailstorms and roofs were blown off. We also had the same in Busoga and Bunyoro regions. This also calls for Government to pay immediate attention to see that if such things are happening, action is taken immediately to improve the lives of the people. 

I thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: We have students of Bugema University. I do not know where they are seated. Maybe they have not yet arrived.  Yes, hon. Mutyabule.

2.50
MS FLORENCE MUTYABULE (NRM, Woman Representative, Namutumba): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I rise on a matter of national importance. As it happened in Kamuli District, the same problem has also hit Namutumba District. On 1st April 2014, the parishes of Bugobi and Kisiro were hit by a heavy hailstorm. Eighty homesteads had their roofs blown off and 19 people were hurt, including seven children.

Twenty one animals died, including 18 goats and three cows. Over 100 chickens died. Cassava, beans, potatoes and groundnut gardens were destroyed and my people have no shelter. You can imagine 80 homesteads do not have shelter. They do not have household items and food. 

My appeal to Government, NGOs and well-wishers is that assistance should be given to my people. Items like food, iron sheets, utensils and all those basic items for use should be availed to my people.

As we all remember, in the year 2012, Namutumba District had the same problem and as a result, we ended up suffering from malnutrition. I would not like malnutrition to come back to Namutumba because we had fought it seriously but now, if these two parishes in Bulange sub-county are not helped, malnutrition is knocking at the door. So, Government and all those concerned, please, come in urgently because the people are sleeping under trees; my people are sleeping in the open.

2.54
MR EDDIE KWIZERA (NRM, Bufumbira County East, Kisoro): Madam Speaker, thank you very much. I am raising an issue of national importance, about sports betting, which is unregulated and uncontrolled and has led to loss of property in the country. People are selling their property to go for sports betting and it has also caused insecurity in a number of the areas. It has also affected our balance of payment because all the funds that are collected are repatriated to other countries and the country remains with a deficit balance of payment.

Another issue is that most of the school children, mainly in urban areas, are given either tuition or school fees and they go and line up and engage in sports betting. I call upon Government to either regulate it or apply the law and in the event that the law is not there, we should stop it until we have a law. 

I thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I do not know whether this concerns the Minister for Environment because this phenomenon is now becoming national. It started in Kiboga, it went to Mubende, Busoga, Butaleja and now it is in Lango. I do not know what you are going to do. Are you aware about what is happening?

2.55
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR WATER AND ENVIRONMENT (ENVIRONMENT) (Ms Flavia Nabugere): Madam Speaker, whereas it touches the Ministry of Water and Environment, it also touches on the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness. However, just pending before this House and in Cabinet, are papers that are going to be discussed as to why these phenomena are happening now.

2.56
MS BEATRICE ANYWAR (FDC, Woman Representative, Kitgum): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I am responding to the communication you gave about our local industries. I have been on the HIV/AIDS Committee for the last seven years and we have been battling with how we can help Ugandans get cheap ARVs. When we interacted with the officials, we were told that there is global politics at play whereby imported drugs are much cheaper than the drugs produced in our local company where you went, Madam Speaker. This complaint has been on going. We do not understand how foreign or imported drugs in this country, including other items, could become cheaper than our own innovative Ugandan ones, which are here to help the country.

My take is that you could help us and have the Minister of Health come to this august House to explain how we can afford to give tax holidays to enable foreign companies and investors take an upper hand over poor Ugandans.

Madam Speaker, you are aware that hon. Ken-Lukyamuzi has been lamenting about one of the companies to be helped but it has not been helped up to now. It is high time that Government came up to explain to this House what they are going to undertake to promote the local investors so that we do not have to depend on imports from foreign countries.

I would want the Minister of Health to come and explain this so that we can be able to supply ARVs and other drugs from our home country that can give us a guarantee of quality and quantity. 

I thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, the point hon. Anywar is raising is important. I had an experience when we went to bury our colleague in Buhweju. I spent a night in a hotel in Bushenyi and one of the industrialists, I think called Movit, came to me and told me, “I have come to inform you, Speaker, that I am moving my industry to Zambia because of the high excise duties in this country and I am taking away employment for 2,000 people.” I telephoned the Minister of Finance and said, “Please, meet this person and see how this can be addressed.” 

I think there is a serious problem concerning our taxation policies. The excise duties are so high that it is cheaper to manufacture outside and sell here because then you out-compete the locals. So, I think we really need to look at it.

Now, I want to amend the Order Paper and I will be allowing the Minister of Internal Affairs to make a statement. Thursday is the day when Private Members’ business takes precedence. So, it will come a bit down. Let me hear from hon. Oketta about the disasters.

2.59
MAJ. GEN. JULIUS OKETTA (UPDF Representative): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I am trying to respond to the concern of people about disaster issues from the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness. We are now having a problem of the natural and human- induced disasters and we are not going to go against it because it is naturally happening. 

What we are trying to ask from Members is that we would like all the District Disaster Management Committee’s in each district where the disaster happens to make up what we call initial assessment, which is done within 12 to 24 hours of the disaster happening and this time, to the Office of the Prime Minister. It should be addressed to the Permanent Secretary, Office of the Prime Minister. 

At the same time, we concurrently act and coordinate with you just like what happened in Kamuli and many other places where the initial responding is to save lives and property. Where properties are not saved, life should be saved so that we can mobilise other stakeholders and the resources because the demand is more than the supply. But once it is available, we can see that other UN agencies and organisation contribute the logistics that is required to put things into place or return life to normal.

So, I am requesting all of you who have these cases to make sure that you give the formal documentary assessment from the District Disaster Management Committees signed by the chief administrative officers.

MR CHEMASWET: Thank you very much, General. The information that I want from you is that – I thank you, Madam Speaker. (Laughter) The information that I wanted from hon. Oketta is, what is the definition of “disaster” and “emergency” according to you?

MAJ. GEN. OKETTA: Well, I cannot define to you scientifically but what we can tell you is that disaster is when the event has caused destruction. Emergency is when the element of the occurrence is lower but we need to respond quickly within 24 hours. The language or definition on the two are used interchangeably but they all mean occurrence of events that have caused destruction to life and property. I thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you. I am directing the Minister for Finance to come and respond to the issue of hon. Kwizera and also to the question on excise duty and the inability of Ugandan companies to survive. Our taxation policy has a problem and the minister should come and speak to it. 

LAYING OF PAPERS

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE TRIBUNAL

3.02
THE SECOND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (Gen. (Rtd) Moses Ali): Madam, I want to apologise and request that we defer this paper to next week when we get the minister. My colleague, the First Deputy Prime Minister is indisposed and so, I will request that we shall respond to that next week.

THE SPEAKER: Okay. Hon. Members, although the paper has not been laid, I had for some time declined to put it on the Order Paper because I thought it was an anomaly for Parliament to be setting the terms and conditions of service for the Public Service Tribunal. But when I checked the law, I found that that is what we did. 

I still think that it is an anomaly for a body to be appointed by the Cabinet and then the terms are set here. But since it is he law, the committee will examine it. I propose that they recommend that we amend and get out of it because it is not our work. We shall have it laid on Tuesday.

STATEMENT ON THE REPATRIATION OF THE BODY OF THE LATE SUSAN NALUNKUUMA

3.19
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Dr Sam Okuonzi): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I make a statement in accordance with Rule 45(2) of the Rules of Procedure. Many Ugandans face serious challenges abroad and Government of Uganda appears to be helpless when approached. 

The Parliament, through the Speaker and sometimes through the Committee on Foreign Affairs, continues to receive petitions, complaints and pleas for help from individuals and groups of Ugandans living abroad, who face challenges such as - 
being brutalised innocently or mistakenly by the police abroad; 
being repatriated forcefully on flimsy charges and they are commonly dumped at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, which has put a huge burden on Uganda’s Mission in Nairobi as it has to accommodate, feed and provide transport to such people; 
being detained for inability to complete payment for medical treatment;
death abroad and repatriation of the dead.

On 18 February 2014, the Committee on Foreign Affairs received a plea for help from the family of one Hajati Hadijah Kaggwa in Namasuba, Pida Zone, Kampala, regarding their daughter who died in Guangzhou, China. The said daughter, one Susan Nalunkuuma, died on 15 October 2012 at the age of 36 at Infectious Disease Department of Guangzhou Eighth Municipal People’s Hospital. The cause of death is given on record as AIDS. The body is currently being kept at a funeral home at a rate of 80 Yuan per day – that is perhaps about $15 per day at the exchange rate of 6.2 Yuan per US Dollar.

Madam Speaker, the Ugandan Consulate in Guangzhou has been in communication with Chinese authorities; the Consulate has informed the family that the Chinese medical authorities say they have no capacity to handle the body of the late Susan given that she died of AIDS – it is their policy. Normally, the Chinese medical authorities would immediately cremate such bodies but the family has rejected cremation because it is not in our culture to cremate the bodies of our dead. The Ugandan Consulate intervened at the request of the family and agreed with Chinese authorities to keep the body until the family is able to repatriate it.

The Chinese authorities, however, agreed to keep the body on condition that they will not be responsible for the state of the body when it is finally received in Uganda. This actually means that they would not carry out embalming or preservation of the body. So, the body would be received in a decomposed state in Uganda.	

Madam Speaker, the family of the late Susan has been unable to raise the equivalent of Shs 50 million to repatriate the body for over one year now. They have sought for assistance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but they have not received any financial assistance. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has advised the family to allow the body to be cremated, which would cost $500 but the family insists that cremation is against their culture and, therefore, they cannot accept it.

The family has approached the Speaker of this Parliament; the Government Chief Whip and recently, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which I chair, for financial assistance. The committee has met over this issue and agreed as a principle that a stress fund be voted for all missions abroad, which face such problems. But in this particular case, the committee has resolved that the chairperson makes a statement to this House and then the committee will explore further possibilities from different government departments and ministries of finding some financial support to this family. If all these fail, the committee has recommended that the Parliament launches a fundraising drive to assist this family. 

Thank you.

3.21
MR JACK WAMANGA-WAMAI (FDC, Mbale Municipality, Mbale): Thank you, Madam Speaker. Uganda missions abroad face a lot of problems, year in and year out. There are many Ugandans out there with a lot of problems. Usually, those distressed run to the missions and the missions do not have any money at all. So, I think it is up to this Parliament to put up a fund under the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness so that when there is such a disaster of someone dying abroad, they can repatriate the body. 

For the case of the late Susan, it is an urgent matter; the body has been there for a very long time. I would propose that we refer this matter to the President’s Office because he has got funds, which can help in the repatriation of this body. I beg to propose.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, this is a difficult situation for all of us. You can imagine the kind of issues we have to deal with here. That family is always in our corridors moving up and down. I send them away but they keep coming back. I think as a country, we need to find a solution to this matter.

Anyway, you are now informed. Think about it. I think we need time to discuss it and find a solution because this is one but there are many others. I think we need a policy decision and can I ask the Government to take interest and then report on what can be done about this matter because there are many of these. 

3.23
THE SECOND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (Gen. (Rtd) Moses Ali): Madam Speaker, this is a very critical matter and very serious because as human beings, we do not know when we are dying and from where we are going to die. Therefore, it is going to be very difficult for the Government to decide right now what to do with this body. I was going to suggest that may be, the matter referred to us by you, Madam Speaker – of course, there is no ministry responsible for death; but since disaster is related to death, we could ask the Minister for Disaster to take on the matter, then Government can discuss the way forward. I think even the House should also assist on what type of policy we should have. 

Thank you. 

THE SPEAKER: One, we shall request the Government to take interest in this matter but also request our Committee on Presidential Affairs to come up with some policies. When Government comes back to us, we can compare notes because no one planned for it. 

MOTION SEEKING LEAVE TO INTRODUCE A PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BILL: “THE PARLIAMENTARY PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2014”

3.21
MS ROSE AKOL (NRM, Woman Representative, Bukedea): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I move a motion seeking leave of Parliament for the introduction of a Private Members’ Bill moved under Rule 47 and 111 of our Rules of Procedure: 

“WHEREAS the Parliamentary Pensions Act, 2007 establishes a retirement benefits scheme for Members of Parliament and staff of the Parliamentary Commission;

AND FURTHER establishes a Parliamentary Pensions Fund for the payment of pensions or other retirement benefits to its members; 

AND WHEREAS implementation of the Act has exposed serious gaps in the law, which need to be addressed urgently, for instance:
There is ambiguity as to whether the scheme is a legal entity; 
It has been observed that the pensionable period is too short;
It does not provide for powers of the board of trustees;
It restricts members from making additional voluntary contributions;

ALSO AWARE that the current benefits due to a Member of Parliament upon retirement do not achieve the purpose for which the scheme was set up. There is, therefore, a need for a scheme redesigned for Members of Parliament and staff of the Parliamentary Commission;

FIRMLY CONVINCED that there is need to amend the Parliamentary Pensions Act, 2007 to address the above gaps and other related matters;

NOW, THEREFORE, this motion is moved that this Parliament accepts the introduction of a Bill for an Act entitled, “The Parliamentary Pensions (Amendment) Act”, a draft of which is attached hereto and to order the publication of the said Bill in preparation for its first reading.”

I beg to move. 

THE SPEAKER: Okay, it is seconded. You may continue.

MS AKOL: Thank you, Madam Speaker. The brief details to this amendment: 

Object of the Bill

The object of the Bill is to amend the Parliamentary Pensions Act, 2007 Act No.6 of 2007, to provide for the following:
Make the Parliamentary Pensions Scheme a body corporate with a perpetual succession and a common seal.
To provide for additional powers of the board of trustees.
To provide for continuity of the board membership.
Make the pensionable period of service from five to ten years.
Provide for additional voluntary contributions.
Include staff of the scheme as members of the scheme.
Change the duration for actuarial valuation from five to three years.
Provide for payment of trivial pension. 

Madam Speaker, in the existing law, there is ambiguity as to whether the scheme is closed with a level status to enter into legally binding transactions with other persons and entities. Amending the Act to give the scheme corporate status will remove the apparent ambiguity so as to enable the scheme to enter into such transactions in its corporate name. 

The Act provides for five years as a pensionable period of service for a member to qualify for pension. However, over time, it has been observed that the five years’ period is a short time and it is proposed that the five years be increased to ten years. 

It has also been noted that certain former members get small amounts of pension, which has unnecessarily increased the administrative expenses incurred by the scheme. It is, therefore, proposed that these small amounts of pension be declared trivial pension and be paid to the former members as lump-sum payment. 

The Act restricts contributions to the scheme by the members to those provided by the Act. It does not allow members who are willing to make additional contribution to their member accounts to do so. 

The proposal, therefore, is that members should be allowed to make additional voluntary contributions to their members’ accounts. 

The Act does not comprehensively provide for the powers of the board of trustees. It is, therefore, proposed that these powers be provided for under the Act. 

The Act provides for an actuarial review to be carried out once in every five years. It has been observed and noted that this is a long period of time and as such, there is need to reduce this period to three years or give the board the mandate to request for an actuarial valuation to be conducted at such a time as the board may determine. 

The current benefits due to a Member of Parliament and staff is not befitting of any honourable member. There is, therefore, need for a scheme redesign for Members of Parliament. 

Madam Speaker, these are the key issues in the proposed amendment. I beg to move.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, the motion is only requesting this House to print a Bill and bring it for first reading so that we debate it on merit. I put the question that the motion be approved.

(Question put and agreed to.)

MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT ON THE PLIGHT OF FORMERLY ABDUCTED CHILDREN IN PARTS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THE LORDS RESISTANCE ARMY (LRA)

3.28
MR REAGAN OKUMU (FDC, Aswa County, Gulu): Thank you, Madam Speaker. This motion is moved under Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament: 

“WHEREAS the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda under Objective III(v) of the National Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy sets out the state’s duty to provide a peaceful, secure and stable political environment, which is necessary for economic development;

AND WHEREAS the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, under Objective XXIII of the National Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy enjoins the state to institute effective machinery for dealing with any hazards or disasters arising out of natural calamities or any situation resulting in the general displacement of people or serious disruption of their normal life;

AWARE that for 26 years, the Lord’s Resistance Army waged a war against the Government of Uganda, destroying property, killing, maiming, abducting, raping and displacing thousands of people in Uganda and causing extreme trauma especially to children and women in the affected areas;

FURTHER AWARE that the Lord’s Resistance Army having failed to sign a peace agreement in Juba, crossed into the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic and have since caused havoc in those areas unabated;

CONSIDERING that the end of the Lord’s Resistance Army Rebellion in the North and Eastern Uganda led to the escape of abductees and the defection of the rebels of the Lord’s Resistance Army creating a need for the resettlement of displaced persons;

COGNIZANT of the inter relationships of communities and states in Africa, more needs to be done by the Government of Uganda and the international community to stop the acts being committed  by the Lord’s Resistance Army in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic to alleviate the suffering of those people;

RECOGNIZING the role played by the Parliament of Uganda in promoting regional stability, sustainable peace and development in the Great Lakes Region and the world at  large;

 Now, therefore, be it resolved that Parliament:
Interests itself in the recovery, rehabilitation and integration challenges faced by the Lord’s Residence Army war victims and communities in the Northern and Eastern Uganda;
Adopts practical measures in collaboration with the regional parliaments, civil societies in the affected regions and the international community to promote the safe release of all the abducted persons from the LRA and repatriation of children and adults who were released or escaped from the LRA.
Lobbies the Government of Uganda and other international agencies to channel development assistance and investment to communities affected by the LRA insurgency in order to counter the development deficit and deplorable humanitarian crisis created by the insurgency.
Urges the Government of Uganda to engage the other members of the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region to recognise the LRA as a threat to regional stability.
Urges the Government of Uganda to establish reparation  fund, offer reparation to individuals and communities that were affected by the LRA rebellion including infrastructural development, access to free health care and skills training and education in order to restore the dignity of the victims of the rebellion.
Urges the Government to increase the budgetary provision to health services especially on reproductive and mental health as well as ensuring that such services are easily accessible to women and children who were affected by the insurgency. And
Urges the Government of Uganda to lobby the United Nations to include all LRA affected areas in its current mandate in Central African Republic.”

Madam Speaker, I beg to move.

THE SPEAKER: Okay, is it seconded? Okay, it is. Hon. Okumu, I think there is something that was not quite captured in the prayers. Some of the victims are children born to Ugandans in the Congo and Central African Republic. They are not registered there as citizens because they have no birth certificates and there is no registration in the bush. So, they have no status. Also the women who were captured from the Congo, taken all over and they have children - those children are stateless on this continent. So, I think that is something also that should be captured.

MR OKUMU: Madam Speaker, this motion arises from the petitions that you received.  One was handed over to you on 20 November last year, by the Invisible Children who represented the victims. It has over 4,209 signatures of the victims out of which 2,400 were Ugandans victims; 1,179 were victims from the DRC; and 630 were victims from the Central African Republic.

Madam Speaker, on 27 November 2013, the Woman Advocacy Network presented a petition to the Acholi Parliamentary Group in Gulu. Later the Acholi Parliamentary Group advised them to present the same petition to UWOPA, which they did last month in Parliament here with over 2,700 signatures of the women victims.

In addition to that, there were also many other statements by Non-Governmental Organizations, the civil society and individuals.

To appreciate this situation, I want to remind the honourable members – the background to this crisis is that the war in the North started in 1986. If there was any normal insurgency, it should have ended on 3rd June 1988 when the original combatants who had started that war signed a peace agreement with the Government of Uganda.

On that day, Madam Speaker, the Leader of the UPDA (Uganda People's Democratic Army) made the following statement, which I think would be of great importance for this debate and he said thus: “If it were possible, we could sign this agreement and wait and bring on board, the LRA….” At the time they were not yet called the LRA; they were called some Christian Democratic Army.

He concluded with this: “If we don’t do this; if we don’t handle the LRA right away, they are likely to become a menace….” He said this on 3rd June 1988.

Indeed, over the years, the LRA became a menace not only to Uganda but also the regional states surrounding Uganda.

In 1987, there emerged another rebel group called the Holy Spirit Movement led by the late Ms Alice Lakwena. Later, in the same year, the emergence of the Holy Spirit Movement II led by Kony appeared, but which quickly transformed itself into a Christian Democratic Movement before they transformed themselves into LRA.

I thought this background would be important for people to appreciate how the LRA have transformed themselves over time, but perhaps today, I do not know; they might still transform themselves depending on the environment where they are. 

But also, I would like to give a brief background to the atrocities that have been committed – that many atrocities have been committed in these areas since 1986. The worst times were after the Operation North and the eventual formation of the Arrow Brigade in 1992 where the population in Northern Uganda was asked to go and support the army to hunt them down.

In response, what the LRA retaliated was to begin cutting off people’s lips, chopping off their hands, and their legs. And that began all the way from 1992 and eventually, in 1994, the Government of Uganda had allowed the Sudan Government Army to get stationed in Gulu to monitor whether Uganda was supporting SPLA and these people were based in Gulu in 1994. But unfortunately, I think they did not come to Gulu with this spirit of monitoring; that was the first formal contact and serious contact they had with LRA and it happened that was also the time there was a dialogue between the Government of Uganda and the LRA but they got hold of the LRA and I think they advised them that they would offer them ground for training and from that period, the  North started seeing massive abduction of people; all these people were massively abducted and taken into Southern Sudan. 

So, 1994 marked the beginning of massive abduction of thousands of people mainly children and women. Thereafter, mass murder followed. People were being murdered in places; you have heard initial places like the Atyak massacres and other places. Again within the LRA camp, these murders continue to the extent that I think some of those people trying to escape from the LRA camps were killed and the abductees who tried to escape were also killed. I interfaced with a child who managed to escape and he said they would be picked to cut people into pieces to show them an example that if they tried to escape, their fate would be the same. So, they were abducted and subjected to that kind of situation, just to cut people!

Madam Speaker, I also want to give a highlight of the victims we are talking about today. These victims are people whose body parts are missing. They were chopped off by LRA or they were blown by bombs. Secondly, there are women victims with triple tragedy. I say triple because these innocent women were abducted; they were defiled and raped in the name of marriage and survival. The LRA would allegedly marry these victims, they become wives, and they marry them in the bush but through the process of abduction, defilement and rape. The third category of these victims is those still living with bombs or bullet objects in their bodies. There are people up to now who still have these objects, they cannot easily access surgery. Others have lived with it thinking it is normal because it is not affecting them so much. So, there are quite a number who still continue to live with these in their bodies. 

We have child-headed families and child mothers, children who are heading families because all their parents have perished. Many of them are in the gallery. Today, you may not see them as children but by the time they were abducted they were either 14, 15, 16, or even below. 

The other category is of children born in captivity. When you look at these women who were abducted, they came back with children.  Others came back with two or three. Others came back with pregnancies, and in this, there is a big question of citizenship. Where do these children belong? Are they children of Central African Republic, are they children of Uganda or are they children of DRC?  This is why I am urging that this requires a concern not only for Uganda but for the entire region because these women continue to face challenges. They are being rejected by their families. 

Madam Speaker, you recall when some of these women came here, a Congolese mother wondered why Uganda was not supporting her and yet these are Ugandan children. She was brought all the way from DRC and she came to this Parliament to present their petition. So, there is a whole question of citizenship, tribal belonging; which tribe do you belong to? There is also a question of family; which family do you belong to? There is a problem of social and cultural belonging. These are for those who have come out. It is a big challenge!
 
Recently, I visited Larok Boarding School and I asked to talk to children born in captivity, and they brought me seven children. When I interacted with them, I asked whether they were being visited by their relatives. Three of them burst into tears; the four kept quiet. So, I thought I had asked the wrong questions. I was told later that one of the children who is now in p.6 was rescued by the UPDF in a battle when she was about two and a half years old and brought up, kept by NGOs and eventually, taken to Larok Boarding School, a government-funded school which caters for P.1 up to P.7 and these children are there. 

They do not know the families they should belong to. So, I asked them and said, what do you think I can do for you? They said that their biggest worry was that after P7, they did not know where to go; because that school will keep them up to P7 and after P7, they have nowhere to go. There is one who told me that “I have an old grandmother, I am still staying with” so that one was lucky to at least relocate with the family. 

So, these are some of the challenges of the children who have come out and they continued to live with us, the question of citizenship, the belonging and more importantly, Ugandans are not so much used to adoption and people only adopt people who are related to them and they take care. So, where will these other children be? Where will they belong? After P7, those in Larok, where will they go? They have no families to go to because they have no tribe, they have no citizenship they have no families, they have no social or cultural belonging and that is a big challenge. 

There are those who are still in active combat; some of these children have grown in the bush and become rebels. They were born into the bush and have become rebels and I want to take this opportunity to give you just three high profile names who have themselves become commanders and are still in the CAR. We got this information from people who returned from the bush and were able to give us this briefing. All these three are children of Joseph Kony, the children he produced personally. They are his sons and are now commanders in the bush. One of them is called Obwor Simon Salim Saleh; he was born in 1993. I think Kony must have had love for Salim Saleh. The second is Ali Lalabo Bashir - I think this tells you the linkage and the relationship with Khartoum, that Kony must have had love for El Bashir who is the President of Sudan. This one was born in 1993 also. 

The third one is called Ochan Chandiet and was born in 1998. All these are a reflection of the kind of children we have in our society. They have become rebels and tomorrow, even if you rescue them, they have no rules and have nowhere to go. So, this remains a big challenge and this is why we raise this issue that at a national level we should look at them we appreciate the contribution of Government whatever they continue to do in the rehabilitation, in the settlement of all the people in Northern Uganda with NUSAF and PRDP but there is no clear focus on these categories of victims in all these programmes. 

There are those who are HIV positive. Quite majority of these women we see walking, are HIV positive; they do not have any clear health support to sustain their living. 

There is also a category with economic, psychological and social problems. These are basically victims. They are being rejected by their families and some of the women have lost their families because they were raped. You lose your husband who says, “You can go; I do not like you.” You go back to your family with a rebel child and the man says, “This is a rebel child; why did you come back with this child?” 

Therefore, these women are finding challenges in fitting into our society and this remains a very big problem.

I also would like this House to know a bit about the LRA in DRC and Central African Republic (CAR) and my colleagues who are seconding this motion will be able to expound more on this. We visited CAR last year and I think the latest was towards Christmas Eve. We visited the UPDF detaches in the Northern part of Obo and interacted with them. We even received the other batch who reported and there were about 19 rebels who came out of the bush. 

I want to inform this House that what I discovered there is that the UPDF have managed to hold our flag very high in CAR with a lot of dignity and respect.  (Applause) They are offering security. The area being occupied by UPDF is called LRA-affected area and it is about one third of CAR.

The irony is that despite the fact that LRA is there, this one third is currently the most peaceful part of CAR because the other parts are impossible; life is difficult. We talked to the community and the governor there who also gave us a petition detailing their concerns and challenges. Hon. Kiwanda will be able to expound on this because we went together.

The UPDF have done and continue to do their part but they also have challenges. Our concern as Members of Parliament who reached out and met these soldiers is, we would like this Parliament to look at our deployment in the CAR with additional support. Human beings are human beings and CAR is a very difficult environment, not comparable to Somalia, which is open and you can move about. In CAR, there is no infrastructure. To move from Obo, to the capital city, you need two weeks because there are no roads. It is a forest. You can fly a distance from here to Luweero without seeing anything.

Our request is that we support our troops. At this stage, in CAR, the UN has given this mandate and taken over the mandate of CAR. Why can’t they take over the mandate of the entire CAR and facilitate the UPDF who are there? I think we still have a voice and we can still push for this.

Finally, Madam Speaker, I want to conclude by what my mother told me when I was young. She said, “Reagan, when you grow up and become a man, do not hurt a woman. If you hurt a woman, you know you are hurting me.” That has kept me. She added, “Women are the fountain of honour and the fountain of respect in a family. When you humiliate a woman, you have humiliated a nation.”

The women victims of Northern and Eastern Uganda have been abused and hurt beyond human expectation. It is, therefore, to this Parliament, this nation and this world to rescue these victims. If not well handled, they remain a source of the downfall of human destiny and human dignity. The hypocrisy, double standards and silence exhibited during the early years of the conflict was not fair to these victims we see today and it is upon this nation that we should reconcile, co-exist and survive as a unit and say that never again should such a thing happen in any part of Uganda. The future of this nation lies in this Parliament. 

Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much, hon. Okumu. Before I invite the seconders, I want to announce the presence of the students of the Department of Law, Kampala International University. They are represented by hon. Nabilah Ssempala and hon. Ssimbwa.

I also want to announce the presence of the Mothers Union from Mbulambuti Sub County. They are led by Mrs Kadaga who happens to be –(Applause)- they are visiting a number of development projects and they are welcome to this House.

3.50
MS JOVAH KAMATEEKA (NRM, Woman Representative, Mitooma): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I stand to second the motion that Parliament pronounces itself on the plight of the formerly abducted children of the Lords’ Resistance Army. I would like to thank hon. Okumu because he has really done the motion justice and it is no wonder that he is now our Commissioner. 

These children were abducted; they did not have a say in joining the war. Their education was affected and their lives were shattered. They saw their colleagues die and sometimes, they were even forced to kill their own including their parents, sometimes and many of them, indeed, lost their parents. 

The girls were forced to become wives to the commanders if they were lucky. Otherwise, they were raped by the soldiers, very many times. They are traumatised.

Some of these, as we have been told, have children but they have been shunned by their families and even where the families have offered love and support, this has not been enough. This is what the children say in the petition that was submitted to the Chairperson UWOPA, which we will lay on Table: “The majority of us do not know the identities of the fathers of our children since the LRA commanders sexually enslaved and abused us in captivity while the few whose identities are known have refused to pay maintenance for the children they forced us to bear. We continue to face rejection and stigmatisation from an embittered community and families that are not ready to accept the children fathered by rebels.” These are their words.

Of course, some of the children have not even returned; they are still out there in Sudan and in the CAR. We would like to urge Government to take special interest in making sure that these children are returned and specifically catered for. We do acknowledge that Government has done a lot in putting in place the reconstruction programme for Northern Uganda but this programme was mainly for the provision and reconstruction of infrastructure. It did not touch specific lives and so, we need a programme, which will touch the individual lives of these people who suffered so that we can alleviate the suffering of these children.  

They need to feed the children they bore and they need to study. These are mere children. Even when we think that these children are not Ugandan children, they are here with us and they are mere children. They need to be taken care of. These children need to know and feel that their Government cares, that their leaders do care. 

And so, Madam Speaker, we would like that Parliament lobbies Government to engage other international players in the Great Lakes Region to recognise that the Lord’s Resistance Army is a threat to the region and so together, they should put into place a reparations fund, which will help identify the victims, identify how much people lost and how much people should be compensated. People should be compensated for the loss. 

Of course, you cannot compensate for loss of life but at least where it is possible, people need to feel that Government cares and it has done everything possible to restore my life and at least they have extended a hand.

This fund will help offer direct assistance to the victims so that they can access health care. We have been told of how some of them still live with wounds, some of them are maimed and both the survivors and the children need health care so as to restore the dignity of the victims.

There are several types of reparations. It does not necessarily mean compensation because we may begin to think whom do you compensate? How much do you compensate? Once we put a fund into place, then we would be able to identify and verify those who deserve and then, of course, we would be able to help people to come together. 

Sometimes, reparation is a simple gesture to say, “Thank you for what you have done for me”; to say, “Sorry, I did a,b,c and d it was not me but the war situation.” This is so that people can reconcile with each other and then get on with their lives. 

Madam Speaker, restoration can never take place for as long as people are still hurting and so, we should try everything possible to ensure that we reduce the pain and bitterness because even when Government puts in place programmes, people have not seen these programmes as very beneficial because they still harbour bitterness inside. 

It is very important that Parliament urges Government to get in touch with the other international players and put in place a reparations fund that will offer compensation that will facilitate truth telling, reconciliation and enable people to get on with their lives. 

I would also like to support the prayer that Government should lobby the UN to include the Lord’s Resistance Army affected areas in its current mandate in the CAR because we have UPDF soldiers who are serving in Somalia who get a different pay and facilitation from those who are serving in the CAR, and this affects their morale. They are all our people and they come from here; they serve in the same environment and they should be facilitated equally. So, we think that this will help to end the war in the region.  

Madam Speaker, as hon. Okumu said, most of the victims in Northern Uganda or most of the victims of the war were women. They are the ones who still have the burden to care for the families and so really, we would urge Government to put in place this reparations programme that will even have a gender reparations programme to target the women, children and the children that were born by the children that were abducted. 

With that, I would like to thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you. Hon. Kiwanda, four minutes, and then the Minister for Gender.

MR GODFREY KIWANDA (NRM, Mityana County North, Mityana): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am seconding the motion for the Parliament of Uganda on the plight of the persons affected by the Lord’s Resistance Army rebellion moved by hon. Reagan Okumu. This war lasted for over two decades. 

I remember that in the Seventh Parliament, I wrote to you, you were my Speaker. I was requesting for Parliament to allow me to go and participate in the war in Teso. I requested His Excellency the President that I be trained under the Arrow Boys. I was in Teso for over nine months fighting Kony and I remember by the time Kony attacked Atiriri, an area between Kaberamaido and Soroti, I was there.

I joined this war, first of all to portray to all Ugandans that this is not a Northern problem but a problem for all of us. (Applause) And of recent, when I hear some people talking about Kiwanda being sectarian, I do not understand because this is a war and problem for all of us. 

I thank hon. Okumu for this motion because at times, some people have forgotten that the Kony problem - they think that the Kony problem is no longer with us. Much as Kony is thousands of miles away from Uganda, the problem associated with this insurgency is still with us. 

I remember when we were involved in the disarmament programme in Karamoja, almost a 10th or more of the guns were coming from the Kony remnants. So, this still tells us that the problem of Kony is still alive in our country.  

In December, I visited the CAR with some few Members of Parliament and as hon. Okumu has said, we must commend the UPDF. The only place in CAR that is orderly is the area, which is under the guidance of UPDF. We commend our commanders who are in this area and I know that they are going through hardship to make sure that these people survive. Our flag is being kept high. 

But I would want to ask, who really funds the UPDF’s heavy deployment in such an area? Are Ugandans footing the whole bill? If so, I want to call upon the UN and other development agencies to help us because we cannot do it as it is too expensive. Most of our vehicles are destroyed there, feeding our soldiers is a very big problem because there are no supplies at all in the CAR. We cannot foot it alone as Ugandans and so the international bodies should come on board to help us with this. 

Madam Speaker, I am happy about the pronouncements that I heard over the radio and in the newspapers that the US Government is coming in –(Member timed out.)

THE SPEAKER: One minute to conclude.

MR KIWANDA: Thank you, very much. I was saying that I am very happy about the US Government coming in to support the end to the Kony question. 

Today, as hon. Okumu was saying, we have people who have no nation. We interacted with some boys and they will tell you they do not know where they belong – whether they are Central Africans or Ugandans. I actually met some boy who speaks better Acholi than he Rt Hon. Jacob Oulanyah. Very fluent Acholi but he does not know where he belongs. We asked him, “Are you Ugandan?” He said, “I do not know whether I am a Ugandan.” He does not know who his father is but he speaks Acholi. 

I think this shows that the Kony problem is not a problem for Uganda but a regional problem. We should join hands with CAR, South Sudan and DRC and see how best we can end this problem. Otherwise, we leave this problem to Uganda.

Thank you.

4.10
MR ALEX RUHUNDA (NRM, Fort Portal Municipality, Kabarole): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I thank hon. Okumu for this important and timely motion for the country. We have been commended for maintaining international and regional peace, which is very useful to us and as Ugandans, we are proud of the work of the UPDF. 

On the point of taking into consideration the soldiers who are in the CAR, of course, the UPDF soldiers belong to one family. So, for one to go the jungles of the CAR and another to move to Somalia; therefore, for one to get 100 times more than the other, is unfair. 

And so, we need to reconsider – good enough, there is a percentage, which is cut from the emoluments of the Somali-based soldiers. I am of the view that we could re-distribute that percentage to cater for the soldiers in the CAR. So, the Ministry of Defence should be in position to cater for the allowances of the soldiers in the CAR. It is true that Kony has taken quite a long time, he has been evasive. The Americans have tried but they have failed. And so far, we are not sure what is likely to happen. So, it is in order for us to motivate our troops based in the CAR to go an extra mile -(Member timed out.)

THE SPEAKER: Please, use half a minute to conclude your point.

MR RUHUNDA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. You know, I believe in institutional building and human development. That is why I was trying to urge the UPDF to see that our soldiers in the CAR are motivated and given all that is necessary to get Kony.

Thank you very much.

4.12
MR REMIGIO ACHIA (NRM, Pian County, Nakapiripirit): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I support this motion and will address myself to the issue of children and their children. We know that children do not necessarily die directly as a result of artillery – not all of them – but many of them have died from preventable diseases like malaria, diarrhoea and many others.

We thank Government for the programmes that have been implemented in Northern Uganda but what is emerging right now – and from this motion, it is clear that we need specific, well-targeted programmes to take care of people who have been affected by this war. We are re-stocking Northern Uganda. I think this is the group that needs to receive those cows. We are helping to open land in Northern Uganda and these are the people we need to support to open gardens. We need specialised programmes for post-traumatic stress, for psychosocial care and for many other specific programmes that would target these groups in terms of helping them to re-create their lives, to counsel them and build their houses. We need affirmative programmes in education; I think it is incumbent upon us as this Parliament to urge Government to put in place special programmes in the coming budget, particularly in education, for re-integration and asset-building for specific groups that have been affected by this war.

Madam Speaker, we have mothers here who were abducted children who currently also have children. We need to help children like the ones mentioned by hon. Okumu, who do not know where to go.  What will be the next level after P.7? There must be an assurance from Government that these children have a hope and a future -(Member timed out.)

4.15
MR AMOS OKOT (NRM, Agago County, Agago): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I thank hon. Okumu for moving this motion. I will start by thanking all the organisations that have been supporting people of Northern Uganda. I will extend my appreciation to the Acholi Religious Leaders’ Peace Initiative, the Diocese of Northern Uganda, Health Alert, Invisible Children, Caritas, USAID and many others that have been supporting our people. Indeed for me, I appreciate very much. When the war was raging, they did not leave us alone; they have been standing with us and are still with us until tomorrow. 

Thank you very much, especially our great leaders, who have been in this Parliament before.  They have been doing a great job.

Before the war started, the land of Acholi sub-region was the place from where Ugandans used to get most of the produce. The Acholi people were not beggars but rather lenders and givers. But the war has left the place eroded to the point that even great leaders like the ones we currently see in this country, some of them were nurtured in Acholi. A case in point is Gen. Aronda Nyakairima who was educated from Kitgum High School.

But today, the education standard in Acholi sub-region has gone down to the point that you cannot find people to rise up as leaders. This is the point I want to emphasise, Madam Speaker. (Interjections) Yes, that is true and he can bear me out, that he was nurtured and mentored from Kitgum High School. And indeed, the war - (Member timed out.)

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, in addition to the groups I announced earlier, we have the Lango Female Clan Leaders’ Association, Teso-Karamoja Women Initiative for Peace, Women Initiative for Gender Justice, Greater North Women’s Voices for Peace Network, Kitgum Women’s Peace Initiative, Dokolo Women Peace Initiative, Lokung Women Peace Initiative and United Nations Women Uganda. They are all here. (Applause)

MS ANNE AURU (NRM, Woman Representative, Moyo): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to thank all the NGOs, CSOs, the religious leaders and above all, the Refugee Law Project, which stood by the LRA abductees.

When the team brought the petition to Parliament, I have a feeling that it is not only on their behalf but on behalf of many others who were abducted even from the different districts, of which Moyo is a part. I also have a sister who was abducted and up to now, she has refused to go back home because she has not been psychologically prepared to go back to Moyo. She gets scared whenever she tries to travel back to Moyo. So, the situation is real.

I would like to second the Motion and all the resolutions that have been brought forward. Social services to these people – we know and we thank Government for providing social services but this is a category of people that needs extra support. Although we say that education is free, it is not completely free; you will find a mother who was once abducted and has no skills because she never went to school but she has returned with children she cannot support through school. And to have a continuous lineage of illiterate people is a disaster waiting to happen. 

So, I really support the resolutions and we should support these people to settle down.

The issue of children who have no fathers – it is a very serious issue. I do not know how we are going to handle it. But I think for the time being, we should –(Member timed out.)

MS ELIZABETH KARUNGI (NRM, Woman Representative, Kanungu): Thank you, Madam Speaker, for the opportunity. I join colleagues in thanking the mover and supporters of the Motion. I would also like to pray that you allow me to amend the Motion by addition another prayer that the Ministry of Agriculture interests itself in Northern Uganda by sensitising and encouraging the community to get involved in agriculture. 

In Uganda, you can never beat poverty without doing serious agriculture. We recently went to the North and we saw a very big chunk of land empty, yet people there are not doing well. So, I urge that we add this so that the Ministry of Agriculture makes sure that people there are seriously get involved in Agriculture and are made to love it. 

I would like to add that the Ministry of Defence, like we have all heard, when doing the next budget should be given more money without asking any questions. 

Thank you, Madam Speaker.  

4.21
MS LILLY ADONG (NRM, Woman Representative, Nwoya): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I thank hon. Okumu for this important motion. As you may be aware, Government is trying to do its best in handling the issues of SLRA – but not completely. I would like to address that issue. 

Much as the final peace agreement was not signed in Juba, there were agendas agreed on, including the PRDP Framework that came from the Juba Peace Agreement. One of the pillars of PRDP that could address the plight of these ex-combatants or the women in psycho-social support has been completely neglected by Government; it is the NGOs and other civil society organisations grappling with it. 

As a result, the ex-combatants, including the women and men are struggling with raising the children and trying to integrate themselves in the community. We have a high-level of psycho-social trauma in Northern Uganda. In my district, in one sub-county, you can have seven people committing suicide per week. And when you ask about them, you find that they are either ex-combatants or somehow associated with the rebel activities. 

I urge this Parliament to urge Government to pull up its socks. Once we agree on something, please, implement it; put in the resources that are required. All these are Ugandans; people used to think it was only a problem of Northern Uganda. (Member timed out.)

MR DENIS OBUA (NRM, Ajuri County, Alebtong): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to thank the movers and seconders of this motion. I will restrict my submission on the prayers on skills training and education. When I was Youth Member of Parliament in the last Parliament, I was party to a partnership between the Commonwealth and Government of Uganda that led to the construction of the biggest youth centre in Africa Region under the Commonwealth at a place called Labora in Gulu District. This centre, among others, was supposed to provide skills-training and business training to vulnerable young people especially the victims of LRA and later on, they would be facilitated to be self-reliant citizens within their respective communities. 

I still have a strong conviction that as a people or Government, we have not utilised this centre to the best. If these young people were, for instance, collected from the various sub regions in Northern Uganda and trained and facilitated, I strongly believe they would be change agents in their areas. 

I still want to urge Government that two things must be realised in Conformity with the principles underlying the establishment of this centre. One, this centre was supposed to train young people from West Nile Sub region, Acholi Sub region, Karamoja Sub region and Teso Sub region. That is one thing that has not been realised. The centre has focused more on some few young people within Gulu District; even Kitgum is complaining, Pader is complaining. Why don’t we facilitate this centre? Whether Government of Uganda, International organisations –(Member timed out.)

THE SPEAKER: Okay, half a minute to conclude. 

MR OBUA: Madam Speaker, the appeal we are making to Government of Uganda or international organisations should be used to facilitate these vulnerable young people; have them collected from these various sub regions and put them at this centre. As I stated, this is the biggest centre under Commonwealth in Africa region. 

Secondly, this centre was supposed to establish satellite centres in the various sub regions and that has not been done. Today, instead of collecting them at one point, they would even –(Member timed out.)

MS HELLEN ASAMO (NRM, PWD Representative): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I stand to support the Motion. Some of us are victims of the war; our relatives died and we do not know where they died. They killed them in the bush. 

I want to talk about the child-headed families. Sometimes, when the parents die, the girls have to take care of their siblings. They may be raped and have their own children to cater for also. The biggest challenge is with the mental health of these children. Some of them do not have homes or even their villages for the last 26 years. 

I think Government should take more interest in these characters that are dependent on people who have supported them as their relatives so that they can be given some work, through rehabilitation centres, Members have talked of trauma; these people need to be mentally rehabilitated to be able to take care of their own lives and become useful citizens of this country. 

It is my prayer to all Ugandans never to call for war. Those of us who tested war know how terrible it is. We should not advocate for war in this country because the effects of war are terrible. Also, as we speak here today, some people are in CAR; they do not know where they belong. I want to say that as we talk about budget provisions, we need to put some money in the Ministry of Health to rehabilitate these people and ensure that they become useful citizens of the country. 

I would also like to appreciate UPDF for the good work they have done. (Member timed out.)

4.28
MR ABRAHAMS LOKII (NRM, Jie County, Kotido): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I join other Members in thanking the mover of the motion and those who have seconded the motion. Above all, I thank the NGOs that have contributed by supporting the children in the North. 

The people of the North need an apology from the rest of the Ugandans. When this war began, there was a tendency to look at it as a war of the Northerners. Because of that negligence, we are now facing a backfire of the effects of this long war. It is important that we present an apology to our brothers and sisters in the North, even as Government.

Two, there is the question of the level of intervention that has been going on in the North. Is it possible to take stock of what percentage of these returnees has benefitted from this intervention? That will help us to know the gravity of this matter.

When you talk about the psycho-social support, we seem to be concentrating more on the children that have come back from the bush, yet, the society itself in the North needs this psycho-social support. There are no way families that have not been given good rehabilitation on their minds and attitude to accept the children and other people they think caused the trouble they have lived with for this long. Remember this North war resulted in families being taken into IDP camps. The war virtually affected everybody.

When the IDP camps were dismantled, it is possible that some families did not go back to where they had been. And that raises a question of land. Where will these children get land if we are to settle? But that said and done, I think there is need to set up a national truth and reconciliation commission. I think this story needs to be told at a longer wave length so that these people can be accepted. Without us looking at this and without us starting to run such a campaign amongst the people of the North, it is going – (Member timed out.)

MS FLAVIA KABAHENDA (NRM, Woman Representative, Kyegeggwa): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I will give a testimony about what the women can go through in the event of war and/or any other disaster. I have an aunt who moved from Kibito and got married in Lira. Her granddaughter was abducted by the LRA rebels. While in the bush, this girl delivered three babies but the mother died of stress because she could not contain the stress of her daughter’s absence. She left the old woman. 

And when the plane that was coming to rescue them from the bush came – she had three babies but she could not carry all of them because it was a rush; they were rushing to be rescued. So, she picked only two babies and left the youngest in the bush. Up to this day, she tells the story unendingly because she wants her baby but at the same time, she cannot recall where she left it. She does not know what happened. At the moment, both this girl and the grandmother are in that kind of state that one cannot imagine. 

We can talk about health; we can talk about agriculture but the reason societies do not understand women is because they never know what to do for them. I can tell you. When it comes to trauma, the women suffer greatly. You may not solve that trauma with food; you may not solve it with health services but the psycho-socio support.

Madam Speaker, the rehabilitation centre in the North would not be the usual business of the rehabilitation centres. It would be a centre that really provides a strategic and affirmative kind of intervention –(Member timed out.)

THE SPEAKER: Okay, half a minute to conclude.

MR KABAHENDA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. It would really provide that support that the people need, the emotional support. They need to be talked to. Even these communities, like the ones that my colleague, hon. Lokii talked about, need to be educated to accept these children even when they do not know their fathers. Like this girl, all the three children she bore were for Mr Joseph Kony. And she keeps disappearing from the grandmother’s home and nobody knows where she goes -(Member timed out.)

4.34
MS JOY ATIM ONGOM (Independent, Woman Representative, Lira): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I support the motion. Whatever the people of Northern and Eastern Uganda underwent was serious. As Members have said and according to the testimonies of the victims who are up here in the gallery, you realise these people feel a lot of shame. They are discriminated against and the population no longer calls them by their true names. Once, they do something wrong, they are associated with Joseph Kony. This is very bad for them and it is embarrassing. So, as Members have said, our people need to be educated so that they can accept them as our own.

Northern Uganda and the people there generally need to receive full rehabilitation. The victims still suffer a lot of trauma. They were captured while they were children and you know as children, it is possible many of them did not know what they were doing. They were trained not to shoot to injure but to kill, which was very normal to them. But you can imagine such a situation where somebody has grown with the mentality of killing. We feel our people need to be rehabilitated to save them from that kind of trauma.

Madam Speaker, if you went to Barlonyo; if you went to Abia; if you went to Amononeno and saw the massacres that took place there; it was terrible. There are some children who have now grown up but they can tell you how they got stuck on their mothers’ breasts. There are people who watched their own relatives where dogs were licking blood - (Member timed out.)

4.36
MR LATIFF SSEBAGALA (DP, Kawempe Division North, Kampala): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I also support the motion. The issue is not all about the victims you are talking about. The issue of Northern Uganda is bigger than what we are talking about.

Unless we do an affirmative action for the people of Northern Uganda, we are likely to lose a generation of people who are detached from other Ugandans.
When we talk about the victims, I would like to ask the honourable colleagues especially those from the Northern region – some of us who have visited some of these areas in our oversight functions, still wonder, for example, where the schools that we had in Northern Uganda have gone. There are some series running on NTV about Agago District showing how these school children sit on the bare floor and study under trees. As we talk about victims, there are other people in Northern Uganda who cannot access education at the same rate with children in other parts of the country.

Therefore, what we should do as Members of Parliament – there are many interventions that have been put in place in Northern Uganda – see NUSAF I and II and many others. But is there is no value for money spent? While we talk about the victims, how about these kids who are in schools and not learning? We should not burry our heads in the sand when the –(Member timed out_)

MS JESCA ABABIKU (Independent, Woman Representative, Adjumani): Thank you, Madam Speaker, for this opportunity. We all know about the events that took place. So, I will focus more on the way forward.

One, is that I want us to reflect on what we have on the ground, the existing programmes. We have to ask ourselves why these victims are there – during our planning, implementation, they are not captured. PRDP, NUSAF I and NUSAF II, planning begins from home. So unless we address ourselves right from the district up to this level, to include these people in all the programmes, we are only singing but not acting. 

Two, I request the government to go an extra mile to review operations of NGOs, civil society organisations, in the name of supporting our people. Many of these people come with their programmes but the major issue in Northern Uganda at the centre is the issue of this conflict which is looming. I request that in the plans of these civil society organisations, the NGOs, to address these issues should be priority. If we leave them out and claim that these people have come to rescue us, we are wasting our time. 

I thank the government and the Office of the Government Chief Whip. When the people of West Nile organised prayers to give hope for the people of West Nile who are victims, the Office of the Government Chief Whip went and was fully represented. The promises made up to now have not been fulfilled. 

Lastly, many people are opting for court to address their issues and this is not sustainable as many of these victims cannot go to court. So, I request Government to go an extra mile so that many of the cries of these people are heard. 
Thank you very much.

4.41 
MR MEDARD SSEGONA (DP, Busiro County East, Wakiso): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to associate with all my colleagues that have spoken on this subject. I just wish to add a few things. I join a colleague who suggested psycho-social support activity. In this country, we do not even have a law on counselling. Anyone who thinks he went to school will engage in counselling and the next time you hear, children have refused to go to school as my sister said they do not want to go back home.

I have been a victim of kidnap by the state before and the moment I walked out of the captivity of the state, whenever I looked at tall men in the height of my brother Gen. Aronda, my brother Rwamirama –(Laughter)- I would look at them as enemies because of what I went through. That emphasises counselling and very soon, my son, the Prime Minister, will look for the same - (Interruption)

MAJ. (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: Madam Speaker, to the best of my knowledge, when Government arrests somebody we do not refer to that as a kidnap; it is an arrest. Again, the law does not know tall men and short men. We are all equal before the law and before God for that matter. 

Madam speaker, is it in order for our learned friend to mislead the House and insinuate that tall people are criminals?

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I think he was saying that the tall people have an advantage.

MR SSEGONA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I just wish to emphasise to my big brother that I am schooled in this area. I have taught this law and I know the difference between an arrest and a kidnap. An arrest has a process. 

The second point is that over and above whatever has been suggested, we need to work on those issues that bring and breed more of the Konys of this world. If we are going to continue spraying teargas, beating, kicking and doing all sorts of evil onto humanity, we are not going to solve this problem and if we attempt to solve it, we are going to solve and create another. 

I support those that talk of national reconciliation; sit on a round table and decide that we own up this country. This business of sending bullets and helicopter gunships to Chad to kill the very victims of kidnap is not going to solve the problems. 

I thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Can the members who are in the gallery, please, observe silence.

4.45
MS ROSEMARY NYAKIKONGORO (Independent, Woman Representative, Sheema): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I thank the movers of the motion and all that have been brought forward. When we talk of gender issues, sometimes people do not understand. They usually say that women just want to make noise. 

I want to bring it to the attention of this House that, usually, during wars, women become victims of such circumstances. That is why, when the women presented their motion to UWOPA, most of the issues that were presented to us have not been well captured in the main motion that has been moved. Therefore, when you look at the issues, for instance, of health, where most of the women that have been brought back from Kony have gynaecological problems, backbone problems, they have given birth to children who are being condemned by their society, all these need to be handled. 

I call upon the Ministry of Health to get interested in areas of handling issues of gynaecological problems especially where those women were affected. They were raped and misused when they were very young, eight years, 10 years; that is why this needs to be really handled! 

There is need for Government to recognise the special and unique needs of the children born in captivity, whose fathers and patrilineal heritage is unknown and request for a review of laws that require information and documentation on paternity to be amended. When you look at what these children are experiencing, they are neither here nor there; so it is total confusion in the whole community.

There is also need to look at the programmes that are being addressed in Northern Uganda, especially when you look at NUSAF and PRDP, how are they addressing the gender issues?? How are gender issues being mainstreamed? That is why, for instance, when they talk of these women who came back, they do not have skills, their education system was distorted; so, when you look at the programmes that are put there especially buildings, infrastructure, these are not some of the programmes that touch the nitty-gritties of such women - (Member timed out.)

4.49
MR GILBERT OLANYA (UPC, Kilak County, Amuru): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to add on the prayers that Government puts up affirmative action for women and children born in captivity. Many of these children, when they came back home, did not know their parents and some of them have never experienced what we call parental care. Therefore, we need Government to come up with the programme that will target majorly the women and the children born in captivity. 

Secondly, in 2010, in Northern Uganda, the office of the presidential adviser came up with a programme of registering those who lost their lips, ears and arms were cut and those who suffered majorly during the war. When the registration was done, immediately after the election, the issue ended. We would like to sound a warning that let the suffering of Northern Uganda not be politicised; the office of the Presidential Adviser, Richard Twodwong by then, they were politicising the suffering of our people! 

They were raising the hopes of the people who suffered during LRA by saying that Government would compensate them, will restore women and will pay fees for the children but immediately after the elections, nothing was talked about that again.

Whenever we move in our constituencies or go for radio programmes, people call and ask, “Where is the programme registered by the office of the presidential advisor?” We need not politicise the war in Northern Uganda. We need not raise the hopes of our people. There is a proverb in our language, which says, “pigi chuppyo bu ki lubira” and it translates that when the wound is healing, you need not to prick it with a needle. Let the wound heal naturally.

The point I am emphasising is that we need not raise the hopes of our people. Let the government come out with affirmative action that looks at those children who were born in captivity and that looks at the women and those who suffered - (Member timed out.)

MR WILLIAM NZOGHU (FDC, Busongora County North, Kasese): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I have just heard one of my constituents speaking in the gallery and he was complaining bitterly about the way some of the soldiers are handled in the process of providing peace.

The gentleman is called Mukeeka and he was deployed in Somalia. The place where they were operating from was bombed. As a result, this man became disabled. To date, he has never been compensated. He has complained to the Ministry of Defence because this is his legitimate right that in the event of such an accident, he must be compensated. But you can see that nothing has been done to-date. We have brought this to the attention of the minister but nothing has been done.

We are going to take the matter further but the issues that hon. Okumu raised are very touching because some of us were born during the war, we grew up during the war and we know what war means. You know, some people only hear about war but they have never experienced it. That is why they are never bothered about what happens to those people in war situations and especially the children. You can see even from statistics that the women are more in number. That means women are more affected than men in war situations -(Member timed out.)

MR BENSON OBUA (UPC, Moroto County, Alebtong): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I would like to support the motion and in supporting it, I cross-checked and found that in the last generation, a generation was considered to be 20 years but today, they are considering a generation to be 25 years. 

Depending on how you look at it, Northern Uganda has already lost a generation and is about to lose another generation. That is why the motion by hon. Okumu is very emotive. It evokes a lot of emotions from some of us who have experienced the war in the North first hand.

Madam Speaker, I invite you and the House to reflect on how it would feel if your entire youth was taken away from you. You have been denied education, you have been given a child who you were not prepared for and you have been denied everything. This is where I come in. When you move around Kampala, you can greet almost every other security guard that you see, you can greet them in Lango, Acholi, Lugbara or Teso and they will answer you. These are the people whose lives have been denied and they are bitter. How sure are you sitting here as a Member of Parliament or as a minister that these people are going to guard you genuinely?

I would like to ask this House that in everything that we do, we should think very critically about these young people – (Member timed out.)

DR MICHAEL BAYIGGA (DP, Buikwe County South, Buikwe): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I support the motion and the prayers sought entirely. I am touched by the statement which reads, “We continue to face rejection and stigmatisation from an embittered community and families that are not ready to accept children fathered by rebels.”

This is the point we need to reflect on and when Government is making any other policy, you need to reflect on this if you are going to re-integrate people found in a specific area. 

One of the prayers, which were sought, was a call for strengthening the Acholi cultural institution because it was also affected in the conflict, yet, it was a trusted body. I think all other efforts have been undertaken including programmes. We are talking about PRDP, NUSAF I, NUSAF II and so on. Government needs to evaluate to what extent these have worked and keep Parliament be abreast with facts of what has been achieved by these programmes, and to see the deficiencies which can be covered by issues especially that can be done by the cultural institutions on the ground. We have been hearing about the Mato Oput, which has been talked about but I do not know to what extent it has been implemented.

I have a belief that people can find home-grown solutions to problems of the time; it is going to continue to be difficult for people to be accepted if at all the people who are supposed to accept them themselves are still embittered. We want to engage also the religious institutions to continue to talk about how people within a given community can engage each other to forgive each other and start again.

For me, that is where the snag is –(Member timed out.)

MS BETTY AOL (FDC, Woman Representative, Gulu): Thank you, Madam Speaker. In the interest of time, I would like to propose that we need to analyse and take some of the issues raised in the petition, for example, about strengthening cultural institutions. We all know that it is culture that anchors us into our society. So, it is very important that this country should help especially in trying to make the children who came back from captivity believe that they are human beings and are accepted. 

I would also like to say that if you go through this petition, you will realise that over 90 percent are women. For us who are on the ground, it is tough and very challenging; a woman comes to your home with some two or three children and you do not know what to do with the woman. The woman gives her testimony and giving her Shs 50,000 is not enough to help the woman. So, for me, even if we emphasise – I know in PRDP; we emphasise a lot about infrastructural development; issues to do with health, education, roads, water and even then trying to revitalise Government’s being in the region was there. 

But one thing that we have neglected and I remember that we even emphasised with hon. Beatrice Amongin, that we really need some increased funding to the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development. This is neglected and yet, it would go a long way to address some of the issues and also to try to measure – if you go to that institution, the Northern Uganda Youth Centre right now, I must tell you that girls and women will not even constitute a third of the students at the centre and yet, the magnitude of the problems is with the women. That means something is wrong and maybe, we need to do a little bit more research.

I would like to thank the Justice Reform Programme and all other civil society organisations, which worked very hard -(Member timed out.)

CAPT. MICHAEL MUKULA (NRM, Soroti Municipality, Soroti): Thank you, Madam Speaker.  I would like, first of all, to thank hon. Okumu for this wonderful motion. Martin Luther King, in one of his great speeches said, “The arc of moral justice is a long one but it tends to curve towards the innocent at the end.” Our children are innocent and therefore it is important that today, we discuss the future having realised the past and what occurred to our children. 

On 15 June 2003, the Lord’s Resistance Army led by a number of commanders including the late Tabule, Ochan Bonia, Abudema and Raska Lokwiya left their defence lines of about 250 kilometres and attacked Teso. The bridge head was in Teso. I take this opportunity to thank the gallant forces of UPDF, His Excellency the President who stood with the people of Teso at that time. We got 8,434 guns and it is against that, that we were able to rescue the girls from Lwala. It took me between two to four days to start recovering and getting back the over 202 girls who had been abducted. Comrades, I want to tell you that I have seen and I buried the 321 people at Barlonyo! Hon. Cecilia Ogwal was with us there and she knows what happened. It took me day and night to bury children, innocent women and men. 

It is only two weeks ago that some of the innocent children that were abducted from Teso in Amuria were brought back from Central African Republic. They were taken when they were only 13 years but today, those two boys are 23. They do not speak any other language apart from Acholi. You can imagine the kind of trauma that the children have suffered in the last 13 years. I want to say that it is a duty for us as leaders of this country to prescribe a future for these children because we there are hundreds and – (Member time out.)

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Kafuda. - Okay, Arrow Boy, half a minute. (Laughter)

CAPT. MUKULA: Most obliged. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. It is a duty for all of us as the leaders of this country now, to look at the plight of our children, prescribe the right political and economic solution so that we can come up with a firm position. If need be, at an appropriate time, we need to have a truth and reconciliation committee so that the country and our people can come together because the past has been extremely very bitter for some of these children. The trauma, the psycho-social uncertainty that they have suffered from needs to be addressed. 

Therefore, I humble myself and say that it is our duty now and never any other time but now, to find a solution for the children of Northern Uganda.

MR BOAZ KAFUDA (NRM, Busongora County North, Kasese):  Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I support the motion raised by my colleague, hon. Okumu. 

The Kony problem is now regional - (Interjections) - Kony, whatever. We need to applaud the US Government for their intervention in the campaign to fight and capture Kony. As hon. Okumu was presenting the motion, I saw him shading tears and I became touched and emotional to the extent that I could not control myself. This reminds me, Madam Speaker – you see, the Kony problem is similar to the ADF problem; currently, we have got very many widows, orphans and people have lost their property but have not got any assistance from Government.

I was recently approached by a man who had lost his private parts; they were cut off by the ADF rebels and he is just there languishing. These people have not got any help -(Member timed out.)

MS ALICE ALASO (FDC, Woman Representative, Serere): Thank you, Madam Speaker. What I intend to do is to move some three amendments; one, which effectively becomes number eight is that: This Parliament urges Government to put in place a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to facilitate national healing.

The second one, which becomes nine, is that: Government reviews the PRDP to adequately engender its components with a view to improving future programmes. Madam Speaker, you are familiar with our attempts in this House to engender PRDP; we would not be debating some of these things now if only we had been taken seriously. The issue of psycho-social support was very dear to our hearts then; we held several meetings but we were ignored. Now, we are debating it. Government, please, review the PRDP, even if it is coming to an end so that you can draw lessons from it and engender the future pillars that you are going to intervene with.

Lastly, that this Parliament urges Government to present to the House a comprehensive statement on the state of troops deployed in the Central African Republic. Again, this is not the first time. 

We have always tried to interest ourselves in the welfare of those troops, knowing that they play a very strategic and dear role. Unfortunately, Government has always not come back and kept its word. So, we want to urge them to come back here so that we debate issues of welfare and we support our troops wherever they are. Thank you.

MR SAM OTADA (Independent, Kibanda County, Kiryadongo): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise to support the motion and to associate with my colleagues who have spoken to this motion. It could not have been a better timing than now that we are going through the budget cycle and that we have this opportunity to speak to this motion.

In my family, my cousin called Victoria Nyanjura was abducted – you remember the Aboke Girls case. And I want to give testimony of the two children that she came back with and the challenges all of them have gone through; she graduated from Kyambogo University this year. So, it is true that these people can turn their lives around and we need to support them.

My constituency hosted and is still hosting thousands of internally displaced brothers and sisters and I want to thank my brothers from the North and my constituents for demonstrating yet again that as Ugandans, we can be together whenever we face challenges.

I will conclude with one statement thus: As leaders, when we are faced with such a challenge, how should we behave? I think it is important that we behave in such a way that we are all coordinated and saying the same thing and sending the same signal. 

I was recently disturbed by a statement by the President when we had disagreements with the development partners. He said, “We actually do not need their support; after all, they send their money to NGOs, which are running around doing nothing.” But Madam Speaker, colleagues who have spoken here have said that these people have done something. Personally, I know that Invisible Children, for example, has done quite a lot and we are also here praying that our Western friends should help us intervene more in the Central African Republic. 

In our prayer, we also call upon our Western friends to include this issue in the UN Security Council agenda. (Member timed out.)

THE SPEAKER: Please, use half a minute to conclude.

MR OTADA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. We are saying many things to the effect that we need to be supported because whenever you have a challenge, it is an African thing that your friends and neighbours come to your rescue. So, when we send uncoordinated messages to our friends, just because we disagree with them, I think we would not be moving in a coordinated manner. In any case, these kinds of statements have become endemic – even past leaders who have done a great job for this country have sometimes been referred to as – but I think we need to re-visit this attitude because this is the gist of my message and a humble word of advice. We need to send signals that are synonymous with the needs we have at the time. Thank you.

MS BEATRICE ANYWAR (FDC, Woman Representative, Kitgum): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I support the motion. I would like to thank my honourable colleagues for giving us a shoulder to cry on. Today, Parliament of Uganda is on record; we have spoken with one voice. May God bless you.(Applause)

Following the passionate debate and the prayers in the motion, I propose that a committee be put in place to make a follow-up to ensure a logical conclusion of the implementation of these well-intentioned pleas in the motion so that we alleviate the pain of the victims. I pray that this be done, if you so wish – with your permission. That way, the world and the victims will see Parliament – having been touched by this emotion and expression – put in practice what we have already alluded to in the recommendation. I beg to move.

5.18
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR WATER AND ENVIRONMENT (WATER) (Ms Betty Bigombe): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I also rise to support the motion and also thank the mover very much. I was in Obo, in CAR last weekend. I must also say that our troops are operating under very difficult circumstances and yet, they are doing everything possible to succeed. They are receiving defectors, feeding and keeping them for some time before dispatching them home. Not only that but they are also working very closely with the people of the region so that unlike in the past where they would kill them or try to hurt them, this time round they receive them, accept them and hand them over to UPDF. So, they deserve every support Government and the people of Uganda can give to UPDF. 

But let me come back home because right now, unfortunately, I did not bring the data that UPDF gave me; that is the number of defectors within the last couple of months; the number of displacements and abductions that still continue in the region. I probably will give it out some other time. 

One of the problems we have is the issue of former combatants of LRA, which needs to be looked into in a very special way. It is not just a matter of a few things. When PRDP and NUSAF were designed, a number of issues that are now emerging were not taken into consideration at the time, yet, there are very many other problems. It is my hope that we will come up with another programme specifically to address the problem of former combatants. 

I say this because some of the emerging issues today are – my colleagues have talked about psycho-socio support. Just this month, I was talking to somebody in Atiak Sub-County andAmuru alone has 46 attempted suicides by those who returned from the bush. 

Some of the reasons they give are very simple; because somebody denied them money to go to attend a burial. This is because they have not been counselled adequately. So, you have such issues. When you have such major issues, how can you even help? Even if we had all the money in the world to rehabilitate them, without getting them on the development package and without reinstating their minds, development efforts might not even succeed. 

But that said, even now, with defectors coming out, we do not have reception centres. It is still UPDF in the Fourth Division that receives them, feeds them for some time and tries to connect them with their families. 

So, I hope that PRDP at least can look into that and ensure that that support is given and give them some counselling before they are dropped off. Not rehabilitating this generation properly had security implications. These are people who have known violence and they have no means of livelihood. And guns are still available; thank God, there will not be another Kony, may be, but it would be very easy to lure them into fighting again. If there is any crazy decedent who gets up tomorrow and starts mobilising, they are an easy target that can be mobilised overnight. What do they have to lose? They have known fighting all their lives. 

So, it is not just that but also the security of the population in the area. I will not be comfortable having a nice home and eating comfortably when these guys are everywhere; they will be tempted to rob. There will be cases of highway robberies and many others. So, unless they are rehabilitated in a sustainable manner – 

THE SPEAKER: Please, conclude. 

MS BIGOMBE: Where you have strategy; where you are benchmarking the progress that is being made by them, then we can leave them. It has also economic implications. Here, you have a huge section of your population who are not productive; what if they were productive; how much contribution would they make? For how long will Government continue to spoon-feed them? We say, they do not have this or that; yet, they are sitting on the veranda playing “Omweso” and all kinds of games and they are asking for drinks all the time. 

We need to come up with a very comprehensive programme that targets all these people. And only then can we relax because otherwise we do have a major problem not just in Northern and Eastern Uganda but the entire Uganda because they will migrate anywhere in the county. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, arising out of this debate, don’t you think we need a prayer of support and solidarity to the UPDF specifically?

MS BIGOMBE: Absolutely, Madam Speaker; they need to be motivated. The only local stuff they can get in the area is “Mayuni”; everything else has to come from Uganda or elsewhere. 

5.26
THE MINISTER OF GENDER, LABOUR AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS, (Ms Mary Karoro Okurut): Thank you, Madam Speaker and honourable members. I wish to join my colleagues in thanking hon. Okumu. I particularly want to thank you because you rode above politics; there are certain issues that should be about politics and above and this is above. We are talking about humanity, hon. Members.  Therefore, I want to appeal to you that when we have such a motion, please, let us ride above politics. 
I was in Gulu and I stayed there when the President camped there several years ago. Many young girls and women would be brought to me. There was one particular girl; she was 12 years and she had a baby. I asked her, “Who is the father of your baby?” She said, “I do not know”. She said, “This child had got ten fathers.” I asked her how and she said she was raped by ten of these rebels. So, the head belongs to Peter, the ears belong to Paul, the mouth –(Laughter)– hon. Members, she was not the only one. 

When you say that there are some people in Uganda who have not experienced war – everyone in Uganda has experienced war in one way or another. It is like the AIDS endemic. We are all either infected or affected; there is no half way. 

So, when you see these children and the suffering mothers, we all empathise. It is not just about one region. I documented the stories of these girls more than seven years ago. It is in my book titled: “The fish from Rwanda”, these are the stories I took from Acholi region. Actually, the President took many of these girls to school. 

So, as the ministry, as Government, we are not closing our doors; these are very good proposals. These children and women; where can they go? In Rwanda, there are children who were born during the genocide; there were fathers sleeping with their daughters.  These are called children of shame through no fault of their own and we have got similar cases.

My brother, hon. Otada, with due respect, when we camped in Northern Uganda, some of these NGOs were doing a good job. But it is also a fact – and it still stands – that we have got many briefcase NGOs here. They come here; you know they are dancing on the graves of our people. Yes, the good ones also are there, I agree, hon. Otada, but there are those that are bad because they see that we are poor. So, they think they can take advantage of us. But we will say, “No”. We must retain something; we must retain part of our dignity and not to sell ourselves. 

Otherwise, we welcome all of them. There are certain issues I cannot comment on like reparation – I see issues of reparation being raised by hon. Okumu but I am sure those will be sorted out. Otherwise, on the humanitarian situation, we are there and we shall do everything possible. I thank you.

5.30
THE MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER (GENERAL DUTIES) (Prof. Tarsis Kabwegyere): Thank you, Madam Speaker. The Joseph Kony phenomenon is a very dark spot in our history. You cannot talk about Joseph Kony without feeling pain, whether you are from Northern Uganda, Teso or Lango and other parts of Uganda, where the activities of Joseph Kony extended or the entire Uganda that was involved in trying to end the problem of Joseph Kony.

Five years, as the Minister of Disaster Preparedness and Refugees, we were dominantly occupied by addressing the issue of camps. Hon. Okumu knows that we went through trying times on how to feed the over 60,000 people in the Pabbo Camp and so on. We know that it took a painful long time to get where we are now.

All of us who have been around and involved in the governance of this country as leaders, we have a pain to suffer. So, it is from that perspective and that experience that I make the following remarks: This is really not to amend hon. Okumu’s motion but to raise the following issues that we should understand.

First, for all these programmes, including the whole struggle of fighting Joseph Kony till he ran out of Uganda, must be recognised as an effort that was to end that problem.

The peace talks, which took place and in which hon. Dr RuhakanaRugunda was a leader - we know how painful it was and how long it took. We also know what results were obtained from there. That Joseph Kony is now in the Central African Republic and still being chased by UPDF, must be recognised as a contribution of this government. 

So, my remarks – (Interruption)

MS ANYWAR: Thank you, Madam Speaker. As Parliament of Uganda, we have been here talking in a voice of healing the wounds of the victims who are actually watching this debate today. We have made proposals that there should be time of truth telling and reconciliation as part of the recommendations to the motion.

So, is the former Minister of Disaster Preparedness and Refugees in order to start including, in the well-intentioned debate – opening up the wounds of pain by alluding to the fact that we should speak about the war activities rather than healing talk as we started? Is he in order?

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Minister, I want to appeal to you – we have all been moving well together. I think everyone has acknowledged the contribution of Government. But what Members are saying is that there is the aspect that has not been addressed; the psycho-socio support to the victims, the issue of citizenship of the children born in captivity – I have not heard of those here, the issue of women who have been rejected by their families; that is what Members want us to address. Yes, Government has done a good job and everybody has said it but there is the other part that we want it to address.

PROF. KABWEGYERE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Yes, among the points of resolution is the fact that this Parliament should lobby Government. But really, is that a correct word to use? That Government should be lobbied? So, my issue is that Government has been involved. So, all these statements are relevant but when you talk about lobbying Government – to “Lobby” means you are dealing with somebody who is reluctant –(Members rose _)

THE SPEAKER: You know, hon. Minister, you know some times you speak in a very insensitive manner. I wish you could focus on the prayers. If you want to amend them, do so. Tell us what the Government is going to do in response to what has been said.

PROF. KABWEGYERE: If the prayer is that there should be reparation, what does that mean? Anyway, if my approach to issues seems not to make good sense to some people, I am ready to take it in the way it is brought to me. 

5.37
THE MINISTER OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Gen. Nyakairima Aronda): Thank you, Madam Speaker. Yes, there is a motion but there are elements that were mixed up. One is that a colleague made a statement that the war was handled as a Northern war for Northerners. That is absolutely incorrect and should not have been said. We handled that war nationalistically and patriotically. That is why it was defeated. So, it was never looked at in that light.

Yes, we have unfinished business in the areas of returnees’ resettlement and rehabilitation. But if that is what is attracting the use of the word “reparations” - Madam Speaker, that is very difficult and you can undertake to research it to see what it means. Otherwise, we have not engaged ourselves in that way.

As UPDF, so far, we have about 3,000 returned children, re-trained, rehabilitated and they are now serving alongside the UPDF. That is work that has been done and whenever a child of 18 years and above is rescued, they are rehabilitated and integrated into the UPDF.

As far as UPDF welfare abroad is concerned, our top priority internally and abroad – the welfare of the UPDF is always taken care of and there are no issues of welfare of the UPDF wherever it is. Yes, it has challenges, like we have in Somalia, but those are operational challenges and as professional and modern troops, we do handle them.

On the question of NGOs and CSOs, that is for another day; some have done work while others are being investigated because of what they are doing in the area of non-accountability of what they bring in our country and then they demand that Government accounts. We do account but at times, they also do not account and we know who is who – (Interruption)

MS OSEGGE: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. Just a while ago, one of the cabinet ministers of the same government in her passionate appeal to all of us as Ugandans said UPDF needs to be beefed up and helped in so many ways in CAR. Now, the Minister of Internal Affairs who is directly in charge of the docket is coming to refute the same statement. 

Is he in order? Doesn’t that signify double standards from the Government of Uganda? We want to know the truth because we are here in good faith. We are acknowledging the situation we are in. Is the minister in order, Madam Speaker? 

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Minister, we have a lot of information about what is happening in Central Africa. Actually, the only areas that one would call reasonable in service delivery are those under the UPDF; so the UPDF is the one rendering services there. And they did not go to do that. That is what Members are saying. Give them more support because they are the government in that area and they need all the resources to be government there.

GEN. ARONDA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. What I was saying is that we are not in a situation where we can abandon our operation because of the circumstances we are in. We have Amnesty Commission - it is in place and they have been doing great work in resettling children who have been returned. Only that we request for further resourcing to the amnesty commission and they will continue doing this job. But as for importation of what has been done elsewhere like in South Africa, that is another area for discussion and debate.

Our own evolved system and method of resettling people who have been abducted has really done some work and the amnesty commission is in place and they are doing work. We only request, as Internal Affairs, because it is under my docket that they be supported further to do more work.

As for reconciliation, we have done a lot; the peace talks took place in Juba for quite some time and the dialogue has been on and I think the government has succeeded at this front and it cannot be an area where Government can be blamed for not having done much.

As for weapons of war, a colleague has said that there is no need for a helicopter or for a tank; if it was not for that, may be Kony would have come closer to where we are. It was because of those weapons that our country from East to West, North to South, is peaceful and we do not have issues of insecurity. (Interruption)

MR WAMANGA-WAMAI: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. If you gauged the debate in the whole House this afternoon, all issues were about reconciliation and that is the prayer in the motion and we want whatever happened in the North to be healed. Is it too much to ask for reconciliation? Is the minister in order to come and tell us that Government has already done a lot in reconciliation? When the motion is appealing for reconciliation and we want the whole issue to be healed? 

Is he in order, therefore, to tell the House that the government has already worked on reconciliation?  

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Minister, I think what Members are saying is that a lot has been done but there are areas where they want you to pay more attention. That is what they are saying.

GEN. ARONDA: I agree with that but on the score-card the Government at all fronts, has done wonderfully and that is why we have today a road being constructed from Gulu up to Atiak.At the security front, the government has done a lot; at the reconciliation front, the government has done a lot but we are aware we still have unfinished business. I thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I do not know whether the mover has had time to synchronise the proposals or we give it time. That would mean that we would have to give time so we can get three or four people to synchronise the amendments and then, we can vote on it on Tuesday.

5.45
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Madam Speaker, we had originally agreed that my colleagues would deliver the concluding remarks from this side, which they have done well. I think to be consistent with the spirit of the motion, we support the motion. However, in order to be consistent with what you have been guiding on to maintain that spirit of oneness over this issue, which is very crucial to clearly demonstrate the unity of this House on both sides, I want to propose an amendment because the way some of these resolutions are framed - and I know it was not intended, I know my good brother hon. Okumu did not intend it, I just want to improve it.

So, if you look at resolution one, which says, “Parliament interests itself in the recovery, rehabilitation and integration challenges faced by the war victims.” It suggests that Parliament was not interested before but we all know that this Parliament has not only taken practical steps in appropriating huge sums of money to support all those programmes everyone has referred to. We have passed laws, done everything possible to support every effort to achieve this. Therefore, I think that in order to avoid giving the impression that Parliament had not been interested before, I want to propose an amendment if it is okay, let us find in that spirit of togetherness, sit together and find a formula that is agreeable to all of us.

So, I want to say for resolution one - because now, this one says, “Now, therefore, be it resolved that Parliament interests itself in the recovery…” So, I just want to say that “Now, therefore, be it resolved that Parliament urges Government to strengthen its efforts in the recovery, rehabilitation …” so that it recognises what has been going on and we are saying there is more to be done because we still have challenges.

Also, in that spirit, I propose that resolution two, which says; “… adopts practical measures”, when you say “Adopts practical measures”, it suggests that measures you had were unpractical. I know that is not what hon. Okumu meant. 

So, in order to clearly bring out his intention, which is the reason for the unanimous support of this motion by this House, I want to propose that we amend it to read as follows, “Now, therefore, be it resolved that Parliament (ii) focuses on the practical measures…” This is instead of saying “adopts”. Okay, that is all.

Finally, there is resolution three, which says that “Parliament lobbies the Government of Uganda.” I agree with the point made by hon. Kabwegyere and I think this sends a message you never intended because this Parliament is the one, which makes decisions. We are the ones that appropriate funds; we are the ones who fund programmes of Government. So, we cannot lobby Government. I propose that it should not be to lobby, to channel development aid because it suggests that Government has not been channelling development assistance.

So, we could say - I had used the word, “… urges the Government of Uganda and other international agencies to increase…” because if you want me to give you evidence of what we have been doing, which is not the spirit as we have correctly observed, I can do so. I have mountains of paper work to demonstrate what we have been doing. All the members of this Parliament from the region comprising the 56 districts of Uganda that are now covered by PRDP are members of the system that monitors and evaluates and all of you have the information that I have about what we have been doing all this time.

Therefore, I think it is proper to say that Parliament urges the Government of Uganda and other international agencies to increase development assistance etcetera. Once you do that, we are on the same page, we achieve the same objectives and we are absolutely together without any hesitation. 

Therefore, I so propose. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much for those proposals. Hon. Members, I want to propose that the Clerk avails the text of the three petitions so that you look at all the prayers in light of the debate and we can synchronise the recommendations. 

So, I want to request hon. Kiwanda, hon. Kamateeka, hon. Nyakikongoro on behalf of UWOPA, hon. Okumu and maybe hon. Bigombe to assist in reformulating the recommendations and take into account what the Prime Minister has said so that on Tuesday, we can take a vote, having heard the entire debate.


Clerk, please, avail the text of the three petitions, which came to the Members. 

MAJ. KATIRIMA: Madam Speaker, I looked at the prayer that it be resolved by Parliament; “(5) To urge Government to establish a reparations fund and offer reparations to individuals and communities that were affected by the Lords’ Resistance Army rebellion.”

During the proceedings, mention was made of the ADF that attacked the Western part of the country and caused great damage in that area. There have also been other instances in Eastern Uganda when armed cattle rustlers and other groups caused damage to the neighbouring districts.

I am raising this in light of the constitutional provision -

THE SPEAKER: But, hon. Member, you are taking us back. You did not speak to the debate. We have established the committee, go and sit with that committee and put in your views. This debate is deferred until Tuesday. Let us hear from the mover.

6.58
MR REAGAN OKUMU (FDC, Aswa County, Gulu): I thank you very much, Madam Speaker and the Prime Minister because I think he spoke on behalf of Government. I think his proposals are not far-fetched, we will agree with them but I also want us to take note of what hon. Alaso and hon. Nyakikongoro had to report. 

There are two things I want to do. One is to request you that since there is not much disagreement, we could as well pronounce ourselves on the basis of the debate we have held, on the motion moved and we would work on those prayers. I have agreed with what the Prime Minister and Leader of Government Business has said. These people have travelled all the way and they need to know that the debate was concluded and what is left is just improvement on the wording to put it in the right context.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Okumu, I did not have time to look at your prayers before we came to the House but I prefer to deal with prayers that are achievable and which are easy to understand. So, I want to see clearer. They are not moving away from the debate and I think everybody is in agreement but we want to refine the areas so that they are more focused and achievable. 

You know, if you are just urging, for instance, collaboration with regional parliaments, what do you want the regional parliaments to do? We need to be specific and say what we expect from the Parliament of Zambia or the Parliament of Central African Republic so that it can be done. Otherwise, they are good but I think they are general.

I want to appeal to you - they do not have to come back. They can go because they have heard the debate but let us refine the resolutions so that they are achievable. I want to really appeal to you.

MR OKUMU: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Lastly, I have a documentary, which has been brought by these women that I want to lay on Table. The title is, “No Longer Silent: Women from Northern Uganda Demand Livelihood and Psychological Support.” They gave me three copies and I would like to lay one for the Parliament of Uganda. I also want to lay yours on the Floor of Parliament because they said one should go to you, the Speaker. I also want to lay one which should be given to UWOPA because they presented their petition to UWOPA such that at an appropriate time, Parliament could have time to view the practical challenges that they have undergone and what they are trying to recover. I thank you, Madam, Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: If it were possible, you could surrender mine to the Prime Minister because I have one. I want the Prime Minister to have a copy so that he can view it. (Applause) 

Hon. Members, we have more or less agreed on the motion. We shall complete the debate with a resolution and recommendations on Tuesday. I thank you very much and also thank our friends for coming and the religious leaders for accompanying them. (Applause)

MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT ON THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE UGANDA POLICE FORCE OUTSIDE UGANDA

6.00
MR PAUL MWIRU (FDC, Jinja Municipality, Jinja): Thank you, Madam Speaker. The motion is brought under –

THE SPEAKER: Where is the text?

MR MWIRU: It is on the iPads. It is moved under Rule 47 of our Rules of Procedure.

“WHEREASobjective XXVIII (ii) of the 1995 Constitution enjoins Uganda to actively participate in international and regional organisations that stand for peace and for wellbeing and progress of humanity;

WHEREAS Article 211(1) of the 1995 Constitution of Uganda establishes a Police Force of Uganda with the obligation to protect life and property of Ugandans, to preserve law and order, to prevent and detect crime and to cooperate with the civilian authority and other security organs established under the Constitution and with the population generally;

WHEREAS the African Union Peace and Security Council created the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) on 19 January 2007 with the mandate to support the transitional governmental structures, implement a national security plan, train the Somali security forces and to assist in creating a secure environment for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Somalia;

AND WHEREAS the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1863 authorising the deployment of AMISOM forces to Somalia and has continually renewed it every six months with the most recent being Resolution 2073 which extended AMISOM’s mission until 7 March 2013 with the mandate to assist, within its capabilities, and in coordination with other parties, with implementation of the National Security and Stabilisation Plan, in particular the effective re-establishment and training of all-inclusive Somali National Security Forces;

NOTING THAT the National Security Stabilisation Plan provided for an AMISOM Police component with the mandate to train, mentor, monitor and advise the Somali Police Force (SPF) with the aim of transforming it into a credible and effective organisation adhering to strict international standards;

FURTHER, NOTING THAT in July 2012, Uganda Police Force formed a police unit which was deployed in Somalia with the mandate to train, mentor, monitor and advise the Somali Police Force with the aim of transforming it into a credible and effective organisation adhering to strict international standards;

COGNISANT OF THE FACT THAT the deployed Uganda Police Forces have a number of issues relating to their deployment; including delays in payment of their salaries, terms and conditions of their deployment is kept a secret, unlawful deduction from their basic pay amounting to $200 per month, lack of protection for their families during their relatives’ absence as well as the lack of rehabilitation for those injured during deployment;

NOW, THEREFORE, be it resolved by this Parliament as follows;

That Parliament urges Government to formulate a policy framework governing the deployment of Ugandan Police Forces and the Uganda Prisons Services in foreign countries;
That Parliament urges Government to formulate a structural and institutional framework and policy for the protection of officers and men who take part in these deployments, protection of their families during their relatives’ absence, the terms of remuneration of the officers and men, protection against prosecution in those foreign countries as well as institutional and structural measures for the rehabilitation of those injured during the deployment;
That Parliament urges Government to investigate the circumstances surrounding the deduction of the $200 per month from the basic pay of deployed police officers;
That Parliament urges Government to formulate and publish a clear and detailed selection criterion for persons selected for foreign deployment;
That Government lays before Parliament a quarterly report on the activities, operations, injuries and deaths, desertions or otherwise that relate to persons in active deployment outside Uganda;
That Government lays before Parliament all foreign assistance agreements or any other instrument which calls for the deployment of Ugandan forces in a foreign country;
That Government gives an assurance that the living and working conditions, equipment and the general welfare of the deployed soldiers is and will be catered for and will be not any less in quality than those ordinarily enjoyed by them at home.”

I beg to move. Madam Speaker, this motion is supported by three Members and there are two Members in the House.

THE SPEAKER: Yes, Chairperson for Defence and Internal Affairs.

6.05
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE AND INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Ms Benny Namugwanya): Madam Speaker, thank you very much. Before I object to this motion, allow me to thank the mover of the motion for his endeavour towards streamlining the operations of our forces in foreign countries. When handling issues of such forces, all of us consider them with a lot of compassion. But I am sorry that I have to stand and object to this motion, reason being that the motion before us now is premised on misinformation.

Madam Speaker, when I look at the last sentence on page 1 which states that, “AND WHEREAS the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1863 authorising the deployment of AMISOM forces to Somalia and has continuously reviewed it every six months with the most recent being Resolution 2073 which extended AMISOM’s mission until 7thMarch 2013….” I want to inform this House that this implies that our mandate ended on 7 March 2013 but the most recent UN resolution was passed on 7March 2013 and it is Resolution 2124 which extends the AMISOM mandate to 31 October 2014. Madam Speaker -

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Member, you know that I was waiting for seconders so that he can justify and then you respond. I think that you are moving ahead of us. Is it seconded?

MR MWIRU: Yes.

THE SPEAKER: Okay justify.

MR MWIRU: Thank you, Madam Speaker and honourable colleagues. On the onset, I would like to put this on record that when we constitute parliamentary committees, the purpose of such is to actually act in the interest of this House. When I was reading about the code of conduct for Members of Parliament specifically codes two and four, they place a requirement on us to act in public interest. I will elaborate on that at the end of the motion but the spirit – actually, I will first seek your guidance, Madam Speaker, on this.

I have empirical evidence that this motion which our colleague is trying to block - that the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs has been facilitated by the Uganda Police Force outside the budget of Parliament. They received air tickets to go to Somalia and $2,000 which, Madam Speaker, you did not actually sanction. I want to bring that to the attention of the House so that whatever unfolds – I have the evidence and it is not my method to divulge information of such nature unless to a committee but I undertake, with your guidance, Madam Speaker, to even appear before a disciplinary committee of this House to adduce evidence to that effect. I want to move to the motion.

THE SPEAKER: Please, justify your motion; it has been seconded. 

MR MWIRU: Madam Speaker, my motion is justified by the following facts: 
That the Parliament of Uganda, while making the 1995 Constitution, made a proviso for deployment of the UPDF outside the country, where Article 210 says, “Parliament shall make laws relating to the deployment of the Army outside the country.” When it came to the Police, under Article 211, the work of the Police was actually limited to a civil organisation to act within the confines of the country. They did not only stop at the constitutional provision, they proceeded to enact the Uganda Police Force Act. Under Section 4, they actually also went ahead to provide the work of the Police as a force that would work within the Republic of Uganda.

I will read verbatim the functions of the Uganda Police Force: “Subject to the Constitution and this Act, the functions of the Force are to protect life, property and other rights of the individual; to maintain security within the Republic of Uganda.” What this means is that the framers of the Constitution knew that there is no way our Force would be deployed outside the country – 

THE SPEAKER: Where are you reading?

MR MWIRU: I was reading Section 4 of the Police Act.

THE SPEAKER: Okay.

MR MWIRU: And if the framers of the Constitution intended that on top of the Army being deployed outside the country, Police and Prisons Service can as well be deployed, they would have expressly stated so. Why am I saying this? When you talk about deploying the Police outside the country – as Parliament, we appropriated money to the Uganda Police Force and since they had a work plan and a budget, it means the money we appropriated was to cater for the activities for which we appropriated. 

So when you take the Police outside the country, the first question is: Who foots the costs? Secondly, in case of any calamity outside the country, who takes responsibility? Thirdly and most importantly, is the issue of the safety of our officers outside the country.

As I conclude, I am aware and alive to the argument that whatever is not written or prohibited in the Constitution is allowed. That is not correct; whereas it may be correct, it is distinguishable in a sense that when the framers of the Constitution talked about the UPDF, under Article 210(b), they proceeded to say, “Parliament shall regulate deployment of the Army outside the country. “But when you go to the UPDF Act, they create circumstances and say, “This is only possible for peace and peace-enforcement.” That means, in my opinion, that we cannot even take our army out of the country for other assignments other than for peace and peace enforcement. So there is no way the framers of the Constitution would allow the Uganda Police Force to deploy in Chad and Somalia as the situation is.

So having said that, I invite you to belong to my school of thought and we pass the prayers as mentioned in the motion. Thank you.

MR MUHAMMAD MUWANGA-KIVUMBI (DP, Butambala County, Butambala): Thank you, Madam Speaker. This is not a new issue. I happen to sit on the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs and in that committee, we have interrogated the Inspector-General of Police and the Minister of Internal Affairs to justify the constitutional provision under which they deployed Police to Somalia. All that they have been telling us is that the Constitution is silent but specific when it comes to the deployment of the UPDF. But the framers of the law were very clear – where they envisaged that the UPDF would be deployed outside the country, they gave the mandate to Parliament to regulate the deployment. But for the Police, it is not envisaged that they should be deployed in Somalia and the Police has been doing some dirty work with the committee of Parliament in order to cover up their deployment and it is regrettable if Parliament continues to behave in that manner. 

A few weeks ago, as a shadow minister, I put to task hon. James Baba, to justify which rules and procedure he followed to fly out a section of members of that committee on a Police budget where tickets and cash were being handed out by hon. Muwuma out of his pocket. That was irregular - (Interruption)

MR MUWUMA: Madam Speaker, I am an honourable Member of Parliament, representing KiguluCounty South in Iganga District. I have never been a clerk to any committee or an accounting officer of any institution. Is hon. Muwanga-Kivumbi in order to dent the image of the Kigulu people and I as a person before this House without giving any empirical evidence?

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Kivumbi, can you substantiate those allegations? If you cannot, you will have to withdraw them.

MR MUWANGA-KIVUMBI: Madam Speaker, I can substantiate. Hon. Muwuma knows as much as I do – and Madam Speaker, just two days ago, the chairperson of the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs took me aside and begged me not to raise this issue -(Interjection) – this is on record. She said, “Please, help us and don’t raise this issue” - (Interruption)

MS NAMUGWANYA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. My honourable colleague, who I respect a lot and hold in high regard, is alleging that I took him aside – I do not know where – to beg him not to talk about the issue he is alleging on the Floor. Madam Speaker, I have never done this and I doubt if he has any evidence to that effect. If he can produce it, well and good. Is he therefore in order to continue making those allegations against members of this Parliament?

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, first I cannot rule on that because I do not know what you do in your committees. But secondly, I want you to concentrate on the merits of the motion. If those issues are there, we will send them to the rules committee. Please, concentrate on the motion. Are our police officers outside the country? How have they gone? Can we regulate their deployment? I think those are issues we are dealing with. Do not go to allegations again.

MR MUWANGA-KIVUMBI: Madam Speaker, when we put this issue to the Inspector-General of Police in the presence of hon. James Baba, all he said was that the Constitution is silent about the deployment of Police outside the country but we are very alert to the provisions of the Constitution; where they envisaged our troops to be deployed outside Uganda, they explicitly said so.  (Interruption)

MR JAMES BABA: Thank you, honourable member, for yielding the Floor. Yes, we did appear before the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs over police deployment and yes, we did say that the Constitution was silent on police deployment outside but furthermore, we said that we are members of the African Union; we are signatories to the Convention of the African Union. Uganda was requested to deploy Police under the AU and we responded. We signed a MOU with the OAU which we laid here on Table.

Madam Speaker, what precedents are we creating about decisions of Parliament when we have dealt with issues like this before? (Interjections) Yes, I laid the MOU here on the Table regarding the African Union and the Police and the Uganda Government when this issue came before the committee and on the Floor of this House. So, why are we bringing up issues again and again when they have been dealt with before? I need guidance, Madam Speaker. 

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I think we should be focussed. If we have made an error in deploying the Police without authority, let us correct it. Supposing now the EU asks you tomorrow; will you just come and lay an agreement here? What this motion is saying is, can Government formulate a policy framework governing deployment of the Uganda Police outside this country? Do you have a problem with that? “Parliament urges Government to formulate a structural and institutional framework policy for protection of officers and men who take part in those deployments.” Do you have a problem with that? “Parliament urges Government to investigate circumstances surrounding the deduction of $200 from the basic pay.” Do you have a problem with that? “Parliament urges Government to formulate and publish clearly detailed selection criteria”  

6.21
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Fred Ruhindi): Madam Speaker, I must say that I am interfacing with this matter afresh. But a few things come into my mind and this is to supplement the Minister of State for Internal Affairs. If the question is on legality, I wish to say the following; that it is true that nothing in the Constitution or the Police Act or any other legislation makes it a requirement for the Government to seek parliamentary approval before deploying police personnel abroad. Such approval is only required in respect to the deployment of army personnel abroad under section 39(2) of the Uganda People’s Defence Forces Act. 

However, one thing that missed in hon. Mwiru’s submission is he focussed on peacekeeping and peace enforcement under Section 39 of the Uganda People’s Defence Forces Act but you may recall that recently, he came here on the issue of deployment of troops to South Sudan; not under section 39 but under section 40 of the UPDF Act, which enables deployment of troops under a multilateral or bilateral arrangement, which does not even need – we came here simply to seek support – (Interjections) – it is on record, you can check the Hansard. Remember, we came here to seek support of Parliament in the deployment of those troops but not as a requirement under the law. As a requirement under the law, we would have brought the motion under section 39 of the UPDF Act. Similarly, what hon. Baba is saying, under a bi-lateral arrangement, Government has capacity because we have under these UN missions –(Interjections)– let me come to that – it does not supersede  the Constitution; it supplements the Constitution. I am addressing hon. Mwiru through the chair. 

Look here, when I was submitting here on the deployment of troops in South Sudan, I emphasised the need for all of us to always look at the bigger picture. The question that you are raising that is legitimate in my opinion – for the avoidance of doubt, the minister is saying that we already dealt with this matter here. But for the avoidance of doubt, they can proceed to give you more information as to the safety of our Police in Somalia, the terms under which they were deployed and so on but certainly not on the legality at all; that is my opinion, Madam Speaker. 

THE SPEAKER: Attorney-General, we are dealing with the police officers of the Uganda Police Force. Yes they have been deployed but supposing you are called upon to send them somewhere else tomorrow; this motion says, can you formulate a framework for the future if you are going to continue deploying them. Why do you have a problem with that?

6.26
MR JACOB OBOTH (Independent, West Budama County South, Tororo): Madam Speaker, whereas the Attorney-General and Government seem to have difficulty in appreciating the intent and some provisions of some prayers, I would agree that some of the clauses are well intentioned. To me, the admission that the law does not prohibit it but allows and also further evidence that there is no law that stops the deployment of the police, there is absolute admission before this House that there is a lacuna. And as the Attorney-General says, this is a matter that can help us in future. 

Whereas I may not agree with everything else here, but to urge Government to formulate a policy framework is a matter that does not call for prolonged debate. It is for the good of this country; if there is no law, then we should find a way of having a policy at least which policy can be translated into law to fill the gaps. It might be proper to argue that since the Constitution is silent – I actually argued thus when this matter came up. But the Uganda Police Force is a force for the Republic of Uganda. Government should not be seen at any one point to shy away from the responsibility of providing the legal framework. 

So this is my humble prayer to Government. In this case, he had this matter, regardless of the other details, this is a matter that I believe the Minister of Internal Affairs and the Attorney-General would comfort the movers and seconders by saying, “We shall look into it”. Whether you take 10 years to look into it, but you will have satisfied the need to have this matter sorted. Really, it would be intriguing, hon. Minister of Internal Affairs; you don’t have to lead a ministry where when you are asked – now there is no problem but later when matters of international law come in to conflict with your domestic law here, where will you run to? This was not envisaged. At any one point, the framers of the national Constitution did not look at any point that a civilian force would ever be deployed outside Uganda and I think that is the spirit. We cannot gloss over this. Let us face this and admit and comfort – you know hon. Paul Mwiru thinks that they might come into Government 100 years from now. (Laughter) So, why don’t we give them hope that they will find this policy in place?

MR MUWANGA KIVUMBI: Madam Speaker, all that we are asking for is that we should be well-grounded as a country so that in future, not a single person is held responsible. The Attorney-General – and I think we can build consensus on this – no one has any ill intent. We only mean good and we want to see –(Interjections)– we mean good, hon. James Baba, I can assure you and all that we are praying is that you come up with a policy. And if there is a problem in the law, let us bring it back to Parliament and rectify it so that we do things right and in the right way. I beg to move.

6.31
MR JACK WAMANGA-WAMAI (FDC, Mbale Municipality, Mbale): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. This reminds me of a time when a police officer made a statement that he had been trained by the British and that he was a proper police officer. The role of the Police is to keep peace and order in the country and not to be deployed beyond the borders of Uganda. But this also reminds me that possibly in this Government, the policemen – and as we know they are being trained together with the army - they wear a police uniform but inside, they are actually army officers. That is why they hold AK47s. Policemen should not hold AK47 riffles in keeping peace and order in a country – (Interruption)

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. We are in an era of regionism – we are now talking about East Africa. So, when we talk about a common market and harmonising policies, certainly our Police are across the borders. We have the framework of the AU, the UN and IGAD. This is precisely what the minister was taking about. So, when we get new issues emerging, the Police must also keep law and order across the region –(Interjections)– yes!

Madam Speaker, on the issue of the Police holding AK47s, the Police are dealing with robbers who are armed with AK47 or even superior weapons. We are dealing with terrorists. So, how do you say that the Police should not carry those AK47s riffles when they are dealing with challenges beyond the normal? So, really, I would like to ask the Member to understand the atmosphere and the environment that our police officers are working in.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, before hon. Wamanga-Wamai returns, I want you to really get focused on this issue. Up to this day, we are still grappling with the issue of the Kings African Riffles – the Ugandans, Tanzanians and Kenyans who were taken to fight a foreign war without a framework. Their children are still looking for that compensation now but it is almost 70 years ago. So, when Members say, regulate how the Police are getting deployed, don’t take it as a joke. The CAR issue has not been resolved in this country. Why do you want the Police to go there without a framework? Please conclude.

MR WAMANGA-WAMAI: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker, for that wise ruling. This is a very simple matter and I don’t know why the other side is arguing. We are saying that let us put a law in place so that the Police go. Formulate the law for this Parliament to debate and give you the right mandate to deploy the policemen wherever you want to send them. But then you must assure their families that they have gone there within a legal framework. Families are here suffering and you are even deducting – (Interruption)

MR SABIITI: Madam Speaker, may I invite the members to look at Article 214 (c) of our Constitution. The heading is: “Parliament to regulate the Uganda Police Force.” And when you look at (c), it says “regulating generally the Uganda Police Force.” Therefore, it follows that for you to deploy the Police, you should remember that I was a member of the Constituent Assembly and that is what we had in mind – that we should have Police do work in Uganda, we regulate it as Parliament but also before we send them anywhere, Parliament should come in and have a mechanism. So, this motion as far as I am concerned, is in conformity with this Constitution. 

MR WAMANGA-WAMAI: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. What we are saying is that you are sending those policemen out there illegally. And we are asking, who is meeting the bills of these policemen? Secondly, what is very painful is that whatever these policemen get, they deduct $200 and the excuse is that it is for servicing vehicles, armament, uniforms and so on. So, we want to make a law before you can deploy the Police anywhere. Therefore, I don’t see why you come up in arms to say no, such a law should not be brought to this Parliament. We are only trying to help you. Let me stop here, Madam Speaker.

MR ERIAKU: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I rise to seek clarification from you. It has been mentioned that the Constitution is silent on Police deployment outside the country but the very opening statement of this motion recognizes the fact that Objective 28 (2) enjoins Uganda to participate in international and regional organisations that are meant for peacekeeping. Our being in Somalia is as a result of efforts by the African Union in an attempt to save our brothers. The clarification I am seeking is: does something contained in the national Objectives and directive principles of state policy of the Constitution not fall under the Constitution so that we can say that the Constitution is silent? How else can we be actively involved in peacekeeping if we are at the point of even saying that our people cannot go out? 

MR MWIRU: Thank you, Madam Speaker. You have rightly guided that not whatever is in the motion must carry the day. Personally, I contend the argument advanced by the learned Attorney-General; I don’t belong to that school of thought. I contend that when the Constituent Assembly was actually promulgating the Constitution, when they knew that there would be need to take our Army outside the country, they expressly stated so under Article 210(b) that when need arises, Parliament shall make laws to that effect. In Article 211, which is about the Police, they did not imagine that a civil police force would actually be taken out of the country. What I am saying is that now that it was done, can we formalize it so that we know that they are gone but we have these benchmarks in place?

Even to allay the fears of my brother, I am not a police officer but my constituents actually have complained on this matter. That is why I am saying that in the spirit we dealt with the first motion, if we can agree on the prayers in the motion, we may not carry all of them. Uganda is not going to end today and I think my good friend, the honourable Minister of Internal Affairs, knows where you have come from and where you are. People have complained to us. So for us to say that can we agree and achieve this - I can even abandon that argument and say, can we have this in place to regulate? It is as simple as that. To end with what hon. Jack Sabiiti has said, the power to regulate the Police generally lies with Parliament and we are saying we have brought these proposals; why are you running away from your responsibility?

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, let me assure the House that no one is objecting to the Police having been taken. What Members are saying is how do we cover them in their going? Suppose they die, what happens to their estate? You are dealing with people not objects; you are dealing with Ugandan people not objects. Please conclude. I don’t know why some of you object. I find this motion just.

MR ERIAKU: Thank you, Madam Speaker and my friend hon. Mwiru, for the question that why don’t we put right what seems to be lacking? The challenge we have is this; the nature of operations of the Police Force and the military outside are as the situation determines. So, when we take the Police out, we sign what we call a MOU based on what is in our Constitution.

6.42
MR JACOB OPOLOT (NRM, Pallisa County, Pallisa): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I first of all want to thank the movers of the motion for bringing this motion. I also want to commend you for the guidance you are struggling to give. I get a little surprised if I ask for instance in this prayer number one; what would be in this prayer that would hurt Uganda? If we were asking for a policy framework to guide so that deployment of the Police outside is predictable and is not haphazard, what is in it that would hurt Uganda? Why don’t we want to have it? And I would think that if we want to fill the gaps, let us take this opportunity and fill the gaps. I would really urge that we open up our minds and maintain objectivity and let us not be nagged by anything else. I really support the motion that we have that policy. 

My second issue is on prayer number seven; I find it very difficult to comprehend this and see how it applies that the Government gives assurance that the living and working conditions, equipment and general welfare of the said soldiers is and will be catered for and will not be any less in quality than those ordinarily enjoyed by them at home. You know we are operating outside Uganda and for some of these things, as Government of Uganda, we have no control over them. I would only think that this provision should urge Government to ensure that they try their best to cater for the welfare of the soldiers or the policemen while out there. But on the issue of - (Member timed out.)

6.45
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Fredrick Ruhindi): Mr Speaker, I think we are proceeding well because my first worry was that we are saying that the Police in Somalia are there illegally. We have bypassed this stage. We have noticed that there are some multilateral and bilateral arrangements under which the Police are in Somalia legitimately. We are now saying that we should have a framework to guide any future possible deployment of the Police. 

Principally, I do not have any problem with that. However, we should be mindful that you cannot for instance sit here in Uganda and make a policy which is going to regulate the way you are going for instance to deploy the Police in Somalia, Djibouti or anywhere because that would entail agreement between your country and any country where you would be deploying those troops to agree on that kind of policy. This is why principally, the deployment of such forces particularly, the Police Force in this case, has been regulated by multilateral and bilateral arrangements which are agreed upon between the respective parties -(Interruption)

MS KARUNGI: Thank you very much, honourable, for giving way. Madam Speaker, the clarification I am seeking is that I have heard very well from the Attorney-General and it seems the whole arrangement is catered for under the Memorandum of Understanding which was signed between the Government of Uganda and other international bodies. I want to know whether in that MOU you agreed that $200 will be deducted from their money per month and where that deduction would go. Thank you very much.

MR RUHINDI: Thank you, the Minister of Internal Affairs will handle that but I am submitting on the points of principle, how things run even, for instance, under section 39 of the UPDF Act, peacekeeping and peace enforcement, there is a UN component.  There are arrangements and charters already which are international in nature - you understand. So to sit here and say that as Uganda you are formulating a policy; may be to say subject to agreements that you may enter with other participating agencies. If it is that - 

THE SPEAKER: But hon. Attorney-General, have you read the motion? It’s just a general motion.

MR RUHINDI: I have read the motion and Madam Speaker, I think my submission is not in vain.

6.49
MR KENNETH LUBOGO (Independent, Bulamogi County, Kaliro): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I also thank hon. Mwiru for bringing up this motion. I remember not very long ago when this issue came to the Floor of Parliament and we debated it, I believe every Ugandan who is really mindful of the lives and well-being of Ugandans should see that this motion is well intended. It is really patriotic. It is for the good of our children who are deployed to do work for the nation. And if there is anything for anybody to object to, probably it could come in a way of amending some of these prayers in the motion. 

I rise, therefore, to support this motion. I look at prayers three and four, which are really obvious and I think Parliament has been asking for this for some time. 

Madam Speaker, there is something I want clarification on. From the Constitution where hon. Sabiiti has read, the Uganda Parliament shall make laws regulating generally the Uganda Police Force. This is work given to us as Parliament and when I see a motion coming that Government should come up with a policy framework - I seek guidance from you, Madam Speaker, whether we cannot do this given the constitutional strength that I have read; whether Parliament or a private member cannot make this move and bring an amendment to the Police Act so that we regulate the way Police is deployed outside the country because we are given that mandate by the Constitution. 

Otherwise I do not have any single objection this motion but I need clarification on whether it is really the work of Government and going by how Government is responding, it seems they are not even ready to bring it up or they may be reluctant and take a long time. How possible is it for Parliament to bring this up as a private members’ Bill for purposes of regulating Police deployment outside the country? Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I think that is what we have been saying; that if we are going to continue deploying, how are we going to do it? It may be necessary to bring a Bill on the deployment of the Uganda Police outside. That is what Members are saying. So, you can bring a private members’ Bill.

6.51
MR SIMON MULONGO (NRM, Bubulo County East, Manafwa): Thank you, Madam Speaker. We need to understand the spirit of the motion so that it does not look like we are trying to criticise the government for not doing their part because we need good faith to know the essence of this motion and also to admit where we think the motion could have delved into matters that could already be provided for.

Madam Speaker, one is that by the time the Constitution was made, issues of state security were most paramount and so there were provisions and interests to regulate the military rather than the Police and so, the Police have not been provided for in many countries. Until recently, I was presiding over 13 member countries on issues of forces of this nature and I can tell you that in Eastern Africa, there is hardly any country that has a proper legal framework that would govern matters of Police deployment outside their countries. Yes, I have read their constitutions and that explains why Uganda could be part of such a problem- (Interruption)

MRS CECILIA OGWAL: Mr Speaker, I happen to have been one of those people who worked on this 1995 Constitution and the Member on the Floor is trying to imply that by the time this Constitution was made, there were no incidences in the region that would necessitate formulating a law to take care of that. I want to let him know that by the time this Constitution was made, we had serious problems with Rwanda, Sudan and around the Great Lakes region and he just needs to go back to history. In fact, that is why the Great Lakes was - is it therefore in order for this man – (Interruption) - I am standing on a point of order. Madam Speaker, protect me because my eyes are still paining from tear gas.

THE SPEAKER: You are protected.

MRS OGWAL: Is it in order for the Member to insinuate or imply that the Members of the Constituent Assembly were not conscious of the militaristic environment in and around the Great Lakes region? Is it in order for him to make a statement without reference to facts which are recorded and known? Is he in order?

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Member, he is out of order.

MR MULONGO: Madam Speaker, I was just developing a point why the countries in Africa and particularly Eastern Africa - almost all of the 13 countries I was dealing with - do not have legal provisions that we are asking our government to have. I remember in 2000 the UN under the committee chaired by Ambassador Brahimi came up with a recommendation and resolution to condition all peace support missions to be multi-dimensional; not just the military but to include police and civilians. It is now because of this that there is need to see how we can develop a legal framework for both the police and a civilian component in addition to the explicit provisions for the military - (Interruption)

MR WAMANGA-WAMAI: The information I want to give the hon. Member is that when the UN asks for police officers, they go for peacekeeping and are not involved in combat like our policemen are involved in combat in Somalia. They just wear blue helmets and they are for peacekeeping. That is the UN police.

MR MULONGO: Madam Speaker, I am not aware of any Police being involved in combat – 

THE SPEAKER: Do you support the motion or not?

MR MULONGO: Madam Speaker, I support some aspects of the motion. I support prayers one and two. The other ones are administrative. For example, regarding number three, if it is Government which the Police are complaining against for deduction of $200, we cannot again ask them to be the ones to investigate. We should have said maybe Parliament investigates and we have done quite some work on this already regarding the military but we can do so on the Police as well.

Then four, regarding selection criteria and so on, there is already a framework in place on how they select those who go in terms of units and the specific officers who are supposed to be seconded or deployed. 

Number five is on issues of reports and the committee handles this. We ask them and they do give us reports. We even visit these missions - Somalia and elsewhere. For your information, Madam Speaker, we have Police in UN in Sudan and elsewhere other than just the one component of AMISOM. So, we should even broaden it.

Number seven is on the issue of assurances as has been explained;  this depends on mission to mission and the UN has its own minimum requirement in terms of welfare of the forces that operate in such missions either mandated by a regional body like AU or the UN. It comes along with it. Even the supply of resources is well-guided in terms of logistic supply, the nature of equipment and so on so these are already provided for.

So, I want to agree largely with the Attorney-General’s information that we have frameworks out there but what we lack is nationally to have a policy or legal framework that can actually be commensurate with the very instruments that we have entered into whether with the AU or UN but we seem to be mixing the two.

THE SPEAKER: Is it not a requirement that international agreements should be domesticated? 

MR MULONGO: Not all of them, Madam Speaker, as you well know. But it is important that we have some local arrangement as well.

THE SPEAKER: Besides, you are not dealing with donkeys but people.

6.59
MR TONNY AYOO (NRM, Kwania County, Apac): Thank you. Madam Speaker, I stand to support the motion because first of all, the motion is not brought in bad faith. I thought that at one point, the Attorney-General was trying to agree but then I was disappointed that he took a different direction at a certain point. I am saying this because first of all, I think the argument that the law is silent has been defeated because once you look at Article 214, it clearly gives Parliament the powers to generally regulate the activities of Police and if at that time issues of deployment of Police outside the country was not done, then that is now our responsibility. I think this is where we now come in because the problem of having Police deployed outside Uganda at the discretion and will and convenience of people in Government is not how we should move. This is what will bring the question of how did you deduct $200 from officers deployed outside? 

So, I want to ask people in Government that maybe if we are worried of the prayer of investigating – that is not the main purpose of this motion but to have a framework and policy where once you are deploying outside just like with the UPDF, the law will be very clear and we would be acting within the law because issues concerning deploying officers outside today – we witnessed in Parliament when an officer of UPDF was standing up in the Gallery to say that he was bombed in Somalia and he had not been helped. This will happen to our officers in Somalia because in Somalia, whether you are deployed as police or a soldier, you can be bombed any time and that is where you need a domestic law that would protect you. 

That is why I am asking us to support the motion and we deal with the prayers one by one and for those that we feel are not necessary - like my colleague said, there are those that are administrative - then we can leave them out but have a policy for this country on deployment of officers outside. We are now dealing with terrorists and so many new things that have come in and we cannot just leave at the discretion of officers in Government. I thank you.

7.02
DR MEDARD BITEKYEREZO (NRM, Mbarara Municipality, Mbarara): Thank you so much, Madam Speaker. in 1994/95 when we were looking for people to come to the CA here, I left medical school and went to campaign for a lawyer to come here to make the Constitution for this country and Gen. Aronda Nyakairima knows very well. 

Now the Parliament is responsible for controlling the Police and the people are going and there is this deduction of $200 per month from every poor policeman that goes to work. What I do not want to even hear is a Ugandan being taken as a slave and the person deducting this money is a Ugandan. Actually, it is a Ugandan enslaving another Ugandan and yet colonialism is gone. We have seen very many people and some UPDF officers being actually tried in the court martial here in Makindye after having swindled food meant for the soldiers who are just at war.

Secondly, I have a conviction and I am very expectant that the Minister for Internal Affairs who is here with us will tell us surely where this $200 is going because he should know that if the money is eaten by one of us, surely General, arrest this person because you have everything and this is the problem. But if the money is doing something reasonable, then fine but honestly, a legal framework for deployment of the Uganda Police is very necessary. 

Madam Speaker, you will only know that a problem is a problem when it has come to your home. The moment your brother is hit outside and you try to find where to go but you have nowhere to go, you will appreciate that things are very bad. This is very good for the whole country. It does not matter whether you come from Northern Uganda, western Uganda, central or Busoga. The whole thing is that these are Ugandans that are being deployed outside and we do not want to see them exploited by these – (Member timed out.)

7.04
MR SAM OTADA (Independent, Kibanda County, Kiryadongo): Thank you. I rise to support the motion and this motion comes from Article 214 and it has been pointed out that the moment you give an assignment to Members of Parliament to regulate something, they must know what they are going to regulate. So, this is a move that is geared towards transparency and accountability to enable us regulate the police in a way that is meaningful by knowing what is going on. 

In fact, if any Member of Parliament is concerned about prayer number three on the deductions of money, then you should be alive to the fact that this arises from the lack of a clear policy, which we are advocating for. If we actually had that policy, prayer number three and probably even the others would not arise and that really is the ill that we want to cure.

Madam Speaker, if you are representing people who belong to an institution and ostensibly the police force do not have a voice in this Parliament as we all know. The only way that we, Members of Parliament, can help them to legislate and speak for them is to make laws that can help them because they follow command. There are institutions which really just direct them to take orders and often time, they do not have a lot of space to bargain. So, their bargain must be in the law and this is what we are doing. 

I support this motion and thank hon. Mwiru for bringing it. We are simply trying to harmonise what we had already done in the UPDF Act to specify those sections that talk about deployment outside and we are saying that since we did it for the UPDF who go to a country X to restore peace, then we need to also do it for another institution that goes there to take care of that peace –(Member timed out_)

MR JAMES KAKOOZA (NRM, Kabula County, Lyantonde): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to support the motion but with amendments. I have seen prayers No. 7, No. 6, No. 5, No. 4, No. 3 and I have no problem with them because it is a matter of accountability and if a minister does this, for example, reporting quarterly to Parliament, it is the global trend that  deployment – but I have a problem with No. 1 and No. 2. The nature and environment of insecurity does not have a standard formula all over the world. Look at the insecurity at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi and Kenya wants expertise from Uganda. What standard formula could you put into the legal framework?

Secondly, I want to echo the words of the Attorney-General that this country has bilateral agreements and Memoranda of Understanding – these are the conditions you agree to with another country on what support you want to give to that particular country because it is totally different. Each country has its problems to address that insecurity but these other prayers, I have no problem with them as they are transparent but I am not comfortable with the standard policy framework when you are deploying outside the country because the insecurity in that country has a different trend and formula. And the moment you sign a memorandum of understanding with that country, those are the conditions which are put in the agreement before the country is ready to deploy that force but not with the standard framework within another country because you will not be able to regulate what is happening in that country. Thank you.

7.10
MS VERONICA BABIRYE (NRM, Woman Representative, Buyende): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise to support the motion that regulations are put in place to regulate the Police activities, operations outside the country and also give mandate to Parliament to have an input to Police deployment outside the country. I also support this motion because it would help us citizens to have an answer to our colleagues who come to us asking about their husbands and children who have been deployed outside the country. Thank you.

7.11
MR GODFREY LUBEGA (Independent, Kassanda County North, Mubende): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I also support the motion but there are two issues I want to raise. First of all, I am disturbed by the military word “deployment.” To me it means readiness to fight, which is not the work of the Police. Therefore, we need to, as we develop the policy, identify two important things. I see nothing wrong with borrowing the expertise from Uganda if we are doing very well. This is a sign of cooperation. 

Secondly, if there is a problem in a neighbouring country, we take our Police to maintain law and order. But we should assign them a special uniform like that of the UN or of the AU so that they are identified as peacekeepers. This is very important when we are designing the policy. But to me, the word “deployment” means fighting and as far as Uganda is concerned, we have enough soldiers to do that. So as the policy comes, let us find a better word to use as the purpose why –(Member timed out_)

7.13
MR JOSEPH SSEWUNGU (DP, Kalungu County West, Kalungu): Thank you, Madam Speaker. If any, I am privileged by the chance I got that at least in my profession as a teacher, I taught very many children of police officers. And I often got time to talk to them; any deployment that is not legitimate will cause problems to you who has deployed and the one being deployed. I will give you an example; today in the Uganda Police Force, you are getting deserters at a lower age. Why? This is because the moment they see what is happening there and the way they are taken there and the privileges, which they are not achieving; the moment they come back here, they will either desert or resign from Police. The best example is Mr Simeo Nsubuga; he was a young man and Government spent money on training him but he resigned and is now in South Sudan.

Madam Speaker, there is also the issue of policemen – you must understand one thing that the job of a police officer or soldier in Uganda involves taking an oath and so, they cannot fight for their rights. It is we, Parliament, to protect them. That is why I thank “General” Mwiru, my chairman –(Interjection)- Yes, that is how I normally address him – for having brought this motion. But already in the Police there is a lot of outcry. Even in deployment, the way these people were selected was not fair – I will tell you this, Gen. Aronda. Some of them are not qualified. This is because in the Uganda Police Force, there are those who never went through proper procedures but came in to give reinforcement but these are put on the list to be deployed out of the country instead of those who are –(hon. Beatrice Atim rose_)- I can take that information.

MS BEATRICE ATIM: Thank you, my honourable colleague, for giving way. Madam Speaker, the information I wish to give to this House is that I live in the Akright Estates where there is a recruitment centre at the neighbourhood. It used to be a school but it was phased out. I met some of the officers who came to tell me that they had been unfairly sidelined during that time of recruitment and what hon. Ssewungu is saying is true that there are a lot of complaints regarding the selection process of those to be deployed outside the country. They almost fought on Entebbe Road because they felt they were unfairly treated.

MR SSEWUNGU: Madam Speaker, as I talk –(Member timed out_)

7.16
MS ANGELLINE OSEGGE (FDC, Woman Representative, Soroti): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise to support the motion and would like to say that if we had brought these proposals suggested in the motion, it would help to provide consistency in the way our men and women in uniform are treated wherever they are taken. But if we are going to depend on those external agreements and memoranda of understanding with AU or IGAD, what are the principles we stand on as a country which we can state; that “If these conditions are not fulfilled for our men and women, we cannot have them deployed wherever you want us to.”

Secondly, I do not think it is a must that Uganda is the country to deploy its forces wherever there is trouble. It is not long ago when the IGP made a distress call that we are short of police officers in this country and so they embarked on a recruitment programme. Now, I think this would have helped us to plan by asking if we have enough manpower to retain, given the needs of our country before we go ahead to deploy them outside the country.

Madam Speaker, by the Grace of God I had a chance to be in Liberia before I joined this Parliament and I interacted with the Police contingent that is in Liberia. I learnt that for one to qualify to be picked among those to be deployed out of the country on any mission, one has to pay a bribe to whoever is responsible. Secondly, -(Interruption)

GEN. ARONDA: Madam Speaker, the Uganda Police Force has come a long way and professionalisation and discipline is the order of the day. There is a thorough criterion - a checklist through which everyone who is to be deployed outside the country must follow. This is done transparently and openly and we have had a number of occasions to discuss it with the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs. So, is the Member in order to impute such a motive on the part of the leadership of the Police that one has to entice one’s pocket before being considered for deployment outside the country?

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Member, that is a serious and sweeping allegation; can you substantiate who gave and who received money?

MS OSEGGE: Madam Speaker, I may not be able to give names here but when complaints come to us as leaders – and while I was in Liberia, I did not even know that one day I would be a member of this Parliament - (Member timed out_)

THE SPEAKER: No, hon. Member, we now do not know who you are accusing. So if you are unable to substantiate, leave it; when you are able, you will come back and lay it on Table.
 
MS OSEGGE: Most obliged, Madam Speaker. I will take information if somebody has evidence on that. Secondly, the people who are taken for these deployments are people with high ranks; the lower cadres do not get the opportunity –(Interruption) 

MR KAKOOZA: Madam Speaker, it is the practice of this House that for such a ruling of the Speaker, if one does not give evidence on a statement they make on the Hansard of Parliament, one must withdraw with an apology or they give commitment as to what they want to do. Is it procedurally right for the honourable member to continue without giving evidence about the sweeping statement she made?

THE SPEAKER: Honourable member, if you do not have the evidence, withdraw; you have accused so many people. 

MS OSEGGE: Madam Speaker, I acknowledged your ruling and I said most obliged. I would like to state here that it is important that our men and women have a fall-back position. 

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, we have had enough debate on this matter. Does the minister have anything to say?

7.21
THE MINISTER FOR INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Gen. Aronda Nyakairima): Thank you, Madam Speaker. The motion with its prayers, if it is to reinforce a framework of enabling deployment of the Police abroad, can be examined and borrow from what the UPDF did. But our concern is what is camouflaged into the prayers of the motion; it is what has caused a serious debate here. One, my colleague in the Constituent Assembly, hon. Cecilia Ogwal, have you forgotten? We did debate this matter and at that time, the AU had not evolved a mechanism of peacekeeping. Therefore such matters could not arise, that is why we had to look on and genocide took place when we were waiting for the UN. At this time, such mechanisms have been evolved and now if a situation takes place, we can take action and that is why we are talking about these things. 

Let me talk about the current African Peace and security architecture; it is composed of three components: The first component is the military; the second, civilians and third is the Police and the AU had that mechanism –(Interjections)– it depends on the mandate. If you are in the DRC, the mandate is different; if you are in Somalia, the mandate is still different. The mandate in Somalia is peace enforcement and that is why we are there. 

I want to allay the fears of colleagues on where we have come from. The Attorney-General has cleared the issue of illegality and I am happy about that but on the $200; if we are legislating, let us legislate on other matters and not on the $200. We have discussed this even with the UPDF as a CDF, committee after committee have discussed this issue until it was agreed that this $200 is to facilitate continuous rotation of contingents in Somalia. We agreed institutionally with this Parliament because this is not the first time we have come here. 

Secondly, on the question of rotation and preparing for rotation, I want to assure you, Madam Speaker, that it was professionally done. I was a Member of the IGAD Committee which formulated the framework that formed up police units in Somalia in 2010 and they have done a wonderful job. 

So if they are coming up with a new mechanism to reinforce the existing one, let us not destabilise the good work that is already going on in Somalia. They have done a wonderful job. Now, as to what they are doing, we are not there alone; Nigeria has formed up a police unit – it is within the mandate. It is not the IGP or someone else who wakes up and gives an order – (Interruption) 

MS ANYWAR: Madam Speaker, we are discussing a serious issue concerning our country and our forces abroad. The minister has just made a statement that the discussion about the $200 dollars has been widely discussed including in the institution of Parliament. I am not aware of any record that says that Parliament pronounced itself on the $200. Is the hon. Minister in order to allude that the institution of Parliament has okayed the reduction of $200 from the serving police officers abroad?

THE SPEAKER: What I recollect is that a query was raised about that $200 and there was an explanation. I do not think we voted on it. 

GEN. ARONDA: Thank you, Madam Speaker, for your guidance. I was talking about the sessional committee meetings; not once or twice. Secondly, this formed up police unit is budget neutral; it is under the AMISOM arrangement. The AU and the UN are paying them and it does not have any impact on our budget. 

The other issue is on the casualties. Again, under that MoU between the AU and our Government, any death is compensated. We can even revisit this at committee level and give details of who has been compensated and all the casualties that have been adequately compensated. 

About the arming, again, mandate dictates. You do not go to Somalia or anywhere with a weapon that is not in the mandate –(Interjections)– yes they pay for everything.

Madam Speaker, the unit is neutral in terms of the budget and casualties are compensated by the AU and handling of the weapons is according to the mandate. So I support the motion as far as it reinforces a framework that is similar to the UPDF’s otherwise it cannot be due to illegality or corruption. I thank you. 

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I put the question that this House adopts the motion. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWERS

QUESTION 08/1/09 TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

7.39
MR DENIS OBUA (NRM, Ajuri County, Alebtong): Madam Speaker, “In light of Section 1 (u) of the National Social Security Act, 1985 CAP 222, which minister is responsible for the political supervision of the National Social Security Fund?”

7.40
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Fred Ruhindi): Madam Speaker, the question is in light of Section 1 (u) of the National Social Security Act, 1985, about which minister is responsible for the political supervision of the National Social Security Fund. I will make my answer as brief as possible no matter how long it takes. 

Section 1 (u) of the National Social Security Act provides: “’Minister’ means the minister responsible for social security”. The law places the overall responsibility for the National Social Security Fund under the minister responsible for social security. Article 99(1) of the Constitution however provides that: “The executive authority of Uganda is vested in the President and shall be exercised in accordance with the Constitution and the laws of Uganda.” Previously, the responsibility for the National Social Security Fund laid with the Minister of Gender, Labour and Social Development. This was changed, pursuant to a directive of H. E the President in exercise of his executive authority to transfer the responsibility to the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. 

The directive was in accordance with Article 113 (3) which provides as follows: “A Cabinet minister shall have responsibility for such functions of Government as the President may, from time to time, assign to him or her.” Therefore, the overall supervision of the NSSF was placed under the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Any supplementary?

MR DENIS OBUA: Madam Speaker, I don’t have any supplementary questions.

QUESTION 013/1/09 TO THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS
7.42
MR DENIS OBUA (NRM, Ajuri County, Alebtong): “Article 80 (1) (c) of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda provides for advanced level standard or its equivalent as the minimum formal educational requirement for a person to be Member of Parliament. And Article 259 of the same Constitution provides for its amendment. 

Given the substantial gains the NRM Government has made in the education sector since the promulgation of the Constitution, what plans does Government have to revise (upwards) the minimum formal educational requirement for a person seeking to become a Member of Parliament?”

7.43
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Freddie Ruhindi): Madam Speaker, Article 80 (1)(c) of the Constitution provides that a person is qualified to be a Member of Parliament if that person has completed a minimum formal education of advanced level standard or its equivalent. Article 80(1)(c) is operationalized by Section 4(1)(c) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, 2005.

Madam Speaker, in 2001, Government, through a Constitutional Review Notice 2001 established a Commission of Inquiry to review the provisions of the 1995 Constitution and make recommendations. One of the specific terms of reference for that commission was to review the qualifications and disqualifications of Members of Parliament and in particular Article 80(1)(c), which requires a minimum formal education of advanced level standard or its equivalent and make appropriate recommendations.

The commission collected views from the people of Uganda and held public hearings before making its recommendations. The commission made its report containing the findings and recommendations on 10 December 2013.

With respect to Article 80(1)(c) of the Constitution, the commission collected the following views from the people of Uganda. On qualifications, the commission reported that the majority of Ugandans supported a minimum academic qualification, the reasons being: a representative at this level must be able to communicate in the official language, which is English; a Member of Parliament is qualified to be a minister; she/he should be reasonably educated to represent the country in international fora; there are many Ugandans with university degrees from which the electorate can choose; A ‘Level secondary education is a reasonable minimum because many who have achieved it can reasonably express themselves. The majority view was that A’ Level should be maintained as the minimum academic qualification.

From the views of the people, the commission made the following observations: whether minimum academic qualifications are necessary, has been the main subject of debate. Although the previous constitutions did not set minimum academic standards, candidates had to be able to speak and read the official language well enough to take an active part in the proceedings of the Assembly. To be effective, a representative must be able to communicate at three levels namely: the constituency, the national and international levels. Ability to communicate in the national or official language is necessary at the national level. 

Although academic qualifications do not necessarily instil communication skills, all communities recognise a basic minimum level of education upon which capacities can be developed whether through formal education or through informal channels.

As already been noted, the role of a representative in Parliament is not more complex. A representative must be capable of analysing policies, programmes and legislations plus representing the country in international fora. Minimum academic qualification for leadership was a very popular demand of the people during the Constitution making exercise. The people did not want a repeat of the era where leaders could not even appreciate the purpose of important public institutions. The people’s views have not changed. The majority believe that a good educational background is essential for effective representation not only in Uganda but also globally. Many have insisted on a university as a minimum essential for a Member of Parliament. The majority however, of the respondents regarded – that was at the time of inquiry – Advanced Level standard as adequate. 

It is worthy to note that over 70 percent of the Members of the Sixth Parliament and over 80 percent of the those in the Seventh Parliament had university degrees despite A’ Level being the threshold. That was when the commission of inquiry was conducted.

The commission then made the following recommendations: the minimum academic qualification for Members of Parliament should continue to be advanced level standard or its equivalent. Whereas, as noted by hon. Denis Obua, Government has made substantial gains in the education sector, the statistics show that even with A’ Level as the minimum, the House is still largely composed of people with at least one university degree without disqualifying the ones who meet the basic minimum.

Secondly, the people of Uganda, while recognising the need to set a minimum and aware of the role of the Member of Parliament, still believe that A ‘Level is adequate. It is for these reasons that the Government hasn’t promoted any proposal to revise the minimum academic standards at this time. When Cabinet, however presents to this House proposals to amend the Constitution, a member will be at liberty to make their proposals on this matter for consideration. I thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much. Any supplementary?

MR DENIS OBUA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I also thank the Minister of State for Justice and Constitutional Affairs for responding to the question. In light of the last paragraph of the minister’s answer, may I know when Cabinet intends to present to this House proposals to amend the Constitution such that I can exercise my liberty to make this proposal at that time?

MR RUHINDI: That is a very good supplementary question because maybe, with this explanation, the demonstrations on the streets on electoral reforms can be mitigated if not stopped. Madam Speaker –(Interjections)– can I be protected? In the Constitution and in the Political Parties and Organisations Act, we created the National Consultative Forum. This forum is fully operational as we speak and is chaired by hon. Ruhakana Rugunda and deputized by hon. Amanya Mushega and with all the political parties that are fully registered and those represented in the House  are being  represented in that forum. That forum has formulated proposals on electoral reforms and forwarded them to the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs who has equally submitted them to cabinet. 

Secondly, the Minister of Justice and constitutional affairs has also received a number of proposals from many organisations including CEDU which had members from this Parliament were led by hon. Alaso and hon. Otada and hon. Mulongo. They were presented to us and quite interestingly and I may not go into details but even the proposals made by Government and those made by some of these organisations and bodies more or less are in harmony with each other. There is the popular IPOD, I am sure they have also made their proposals and may be any time he may be receiving them.

As I speak, there is a cabinet committee chaired by the Rt Hon. Prime Minister which is considering these proposals and it is my belief - I cannot actually speak for the chairperson of that committee but all efforts are being made to ensure that as soon as possible those proposals are translated into Bills to be presented in this House. Since we are moving together as stake holders, my view is that we can keep updating this House regularly as the progress on these constitutional and electoral reforms so that there is peace in the countryside because we have been moving together and I don’t see why we cannot actually keep moving together particularly in this House where we can give each other responses rather than seeking responses on the streets. Thank you so much.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you so much, Attorney-General. My response to that would be two things; one is that the Electoral Commission have issued their timetable for the elections and in their timetable there are areas that would have required legislation by now. Secondly, as the head of this institution, I would have been very happy if the amendments are brought before the close of the Third Session so that we can discuss them soberly, carefully and not in a hurry. That is my only comment.

MR RUHINDI: I will transmit that message; good enough the Deputy Leader of Government Business is in the House and we shall certainly take up this matter as you have proposed.

THE PLANT PROTECTION AND HEALTH BILL, 2010

7.44
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL INDUSTRY AND FISHERIES (ANIMAL INDUSTRY) (Maj. Bright Rwamirama): Thank you, Madam Speaker. The committee has done a very good job. However, there are some issues they have recommended that will need consultation with key stakeholders and I would request that we defer the Bill for three weeks because there are some serious issues that we need to consult key stakeholders including Cabinet. But otherwise technically we have agreed with them except what I had earlier on informed you, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I have been putting the committee under pressure because this is a Bill that was first read for the first time in 2010. We really wanted to get the outstanding Bills out of the way but let it be recorded that the committee is ready with this report but the Government is not ready for the second reading.

7.45
MR MATHIAS KASAMBA (NRM, Kakuuto County, Rakai): Madam Speaker, I appeal for the indulgence of the Minister of Agriculture to allow the report to be read so that Cabinet reviews what Parliament presented formally to the House and then they come back with the proposals on the amendments we have carried within the committee such that it is a working document of Parliament; so that Cabinet can debate on it freely because now it is the document of the committee. I propose that I read the report without going into the committee of the Whole House to carry on the amendments and when Cabinet comes back with consensus on the amendments, we carry the amendments. 

THE SPEAKER: My difficulty is that the minister is the owner of the Bill and the minister must move for the second reading and justify why he is bringing the Bill before you present. That is the dilemma I have. So, let it be recorded that the House is ready but the government is not.

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Madam Speaker, we need to put the record correct because as you recall, many times I have been to you about this Bill so that we pass it. Along the way, something developed that brings a charge on the Consolidated Fund and I think we need to consult so that we move together. He knows we are together in everything except that there are two amendments that really need the House. They represent the House.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Minister, that is what we are saying; that you are the ones who are not ready but the chairman is ready. Because you are the mover, you are not ready to move for the second reading.

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Most obliged, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: we will monitor; you have done your work and we will get you another date. There was a matter which was supposed to come on Tuesday concerning hon. Otada’s issue. Let us ask the Minister of Internal Affairs to present his statement as item No. 10, if you are ready. If you are not, you also tell us.

MINISTERIAL STATEMENT

7.47
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr James Baba): Madam Speaker, my senior colleague has just stepped out he is coming back. He is the one going to read the statement. He has been here but he just stepped out.

MR OTADA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I want to thank you for recognising my issue as a substantive issue that should be dealt with by the minister as a standalone issue. When I look at the report and I don’t intend to pre-empt the report in any way, I see that my issue is a by-the-way; it is not a substantive issue in the spirit which you have guided. According to this report, it comes as an addendum and in fact the report which the minister is going to read is on the Police bursting up public rallies and things like that and the two are totally not related. 

So, I just wanted to draw your attention to that and let you know that my issue has been treated as a by-the-way and it is actually overshadowed by this, if you are to look at the report. I beg your indulgence just in case I have gone ahead of myself without your permission, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Minister, you know these were two separate issues - one from hon. Otada and the other from hon. Osegge.  Of course I haven’t read your statement but the member feels that you have relegated his issues. Please present.

7.28
THE MINISTER FOR INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Gen. Aronda Nyakairima): Thank you, Madam Speaker. Even this coming Saturday, we have a fully-fledged meeting, a sub-regional meeting of the Bunyoro sub region and we intend to discuss this matter of Kiryadongo and I invite you to that meeting. We will fully tackle everything. We informed members and there is someone coordinating. So, it is not that we have put it where it is because we are not concerned about our people who have been killed. This is your concern, this is our concern and we take it very seriously. I just want to assure you, hon. Otada.

MR OTADA: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. As we all know, matters of security do not need to be handled as though the world is coming to an end tomorrow. Personally, I would accept that my issue be delayed if the minister is going to do more justice to it so that we receive it when it is properly thought out and substantially dealt with. For my part, I would not want to say that it is here and now. I am actually giving in to my issue coming in later when it is properly dealt with. That is my thought, Madam Speaker.

GEN. ARONDA: Madam Speaker, the points we are outlining under the way forward is where the subsequent measures will come in. For now, let us present the report as we were required by you, Madam Speaker. I have two reports; one is about the events that unfold -

THE SPEAKER: But hon. minister, you know when hon. Otada was raising the issues here, he mentioned names of individuals, political assistants and the other chairman. There were names of three people and he said these three people who were attached to him politically have been murdered. In your answer, I do not see them. Okay, present.

GEN. ARONDA: There is an annex; a whole tabulation of the action that has been taken. Thank you, Madam Speaker. This is a statement to Parliament on the response to allegations that some political leaders are denied permission to hold public meetings, the conduct of the Police Force and a report of murder cases in Kiryandongo District.

On Wednesday, 26 March 2014, hon. Angelline Osegge, Woman MP Soroti District, alleged that the Police recklessly used teargas in Mbale and Soroti to disperse rallies. Hon. Sam Otada, Member of Parliament representing Kibanda County, Kiryandongo District raised a question on the Floor of the House concerning murders that Kiryandongo District had faced. Hon. Members, for the purpose of clarity, the following is an elaborate account of what transpired. 

The conduct of the Police Force in public order management

In addition to what hon. Sam Otada and hon. Angelline Osegge raised on the Floor, there have also been reports in the press alleging that some political leaders have been denied permission to hold public meetings contrary to the provision of the Public Order Management Act. The said meetings were organised by a group of political leaders, civil society organisations and some eminent national leaders under their umbrella, The Call for Free and Fair Elections Now.

A letter requesting me for a meeting with some of the leaders of the group was therefore sent to me. The letter was signed by Ambassador Olara Otunnu. I am glad, Madam Speaker, to report that yesterday, 2 April 2014, I met these leaders and discussed many of these issues. During that meeting, we agreed on the procedures to be followed in future in accordance with the law. I will, after this, present a report of what we discussed with hon. Baba, the IGP, other technical officers and I.

However, in view of what has been said, it is necessary to give a correct account of what happened so that the record is put right. First and foremost, everybody including organisers of such meetings is in agreement that the meetings fall under the domain of the provisions of the Public Order Management Act and therefore the Police should be notified in time. As has been explained on a number of occasions, the notification is necessary to enable the Police make appropriate arrangements to provide adequate security and generally police the event.

The Police have a mandate to maintain law and order, protect lives and property and to prevent and detect crime. In doing so, the Police continually insist that occasions such as public meetings are conducted in accordance with the law. The meetings that have been organised in towns such as Soroti, Mbale, Masaka, Tororo, Kabale, Kasese and Mbarara have several distinguishing characteristics. In some of the meetings, the Police were duly notified while in others, the Police were not notified at all. In Mbarara, Masaka, Tororo and Bushenyi for instance where the Police were notified, the meetings proceeded very well because the Police was given sufficient notice to secure the events.

In other areas such as Soroti, Mbale and Kabale where the Police were not notified, the meetings could not take place because the organisers did not follow the provisions of the law and therefore the Police could not make necessary arrangements to secure the events.

In the case of Mbale for example, on 22 March 2014 at around 11:00 hours, the organisers intended to hold a rally and consultative meeting in Soroti Hall in Mbale Municipality without following prescribed procedures. The Police engaged the organisers, advising them not to convene a meeting contrary to provisions of the law. The organisers insisted on going ahead with the rally. The Regional Police Commander, Elgon, made a proclamation advising them to peacefully disperse. When they insisted on holding the rally, they were dispersed and a fracas ensued where the Police were beaten and pelted with stones by the crowds. The rowdy crowds dispersed but later regrouped around Bishop Wesike Road and Lions Children’s Park in Mbale Municipality. In order to restore calmness, Police used non-lethal methods to restore order in the town.

For the rally in Soroti Municipality on 23 March 2014, the organisers notified the DPC Soroti in a letter dated 19 March 2014 but was delivered on 22 March 2014, a day to the scheduled date of the meeting. The law requires a minimum of three days notification prior to holding of a public meeting. This requirement was not met. In addition, there was no indication of consent from the owner of the venue at Lions Club where the meeting was scheduled to take place.

The DPC wrote back to the organisers notifying them that the meeting was not going to take place since they had not followed guidelines. The organisers later, at around 15:30 hours, convened at Desert Island Hotel. Hon. Angelline Osegge, the District Woman MP Soroti, mobilised for this meeting. A Police officer – DAIP Egwang Michael who had been deployed at Desert Island Hotel was attacked and beaten. A police camera and his warrant card were confiscated. The Police led by the DPC Soroti intervened and rescued the officer. This is where the crowd started pelting the Police with stones and in response, the Police dispersed the crowds.

From the report of the Regional Police Commander, East Kyoga - that is a policing region - the Police camera and the warrant card were later returned to Soroti Police station by Hon. Cecilia Ogwal. She stated that she got them from hon. Angelline Osegge. I have instructed investigations into the Soroti incident and as soon as investigations are complete, the report will be availed. 

Similarly as observed, Police officers have been attacked on several occasions in the course of their duties by some people. The Police will take appropriate action against the culprits. 

On the other hand, in areas where the organisers under the banner; “The Call for Free and Fair Elections Now” followed the Public Order Management guidelines, the meetings were successfully held without any incident. For example on 7 March 2014, a meeting was held at Mbarara Boma Grounds in Mbarara Municipality from 14:00 hours to 17:00 hours without any incident. 

On 8 March 2014, a meeting was held at Bunyonyi Public Primary School – Nyendo, Masaka District from 14:30 hours up to 18: 00 hours without any incident. 

On 14 March 2014, a meeting was held at Homeland Hotel Kabirisi Road in Ishaka, Bushenyi District from 14:00 hours up to 17:30 hours without any quarrel.

On 21 March, 2014, a meeting was held in the Youth Centre, Tororo Municipality from 14:00 hours to 17:30 hours.

The question that needs to be answered therefore is why the meetings in Mbarara and other places were appropriately convened and held while those in Soroti and Mbale were not?
 
The answer is simple; the Police in Mbarara, Bushenyi, Masaka and Tororo were notified in time. They made adequate arrangements to secure the meetings. For the meeting in Mbale, there was no notice at all while for the meeting in Soroti, the Police was not notified in time as required by the law. It appears the organisers under the banner; “The Call for Free and Fair Elections Now” or their agents discriminately notify the Police about the meetings.

The manner in which for instance the meeting in Mbarara was organised clearly shows that the organisers are very conversant with the provisions of the Public Order Management Act. Before this meeting was convened, the organisers notified the Police of the intention to hold the meeting well in time. They also proved that they have obtained consent from the owner of the premises, Boma Grounds. The Police cross-checked and confirmed that indeed the venue was available and the owner had given consent. 

On receipt of the notice, the Police held a meeting with the organisers and agreed on how to provide security for the meeting. Among others, it was agreed that there shall be no procession and that even though the Police was to provide security, the organisers would also have their own personnel ensuring security as well in conjunction with the Police. Their own security was given tags by the organizers for ease of identification. This process shows clear collaboration and compliance with the law on the part of the organizers. This is the same process that the organizers ought to have duplicated in respect of the meetings that were to be held in Mbale, Soroti and elsewhere for that matter.

It is certainly clear that the organisers did not follow the same procedure elsewhere that worked so smoothly in Mbarara and other places. Had they followed the procedure, definitely the meetings in Mbale and Soroti would have been successful.

After the experience of Mbale and Soroti, the organisers decided to follow the law as they did in Mbarara. In their preparations to convene the meeting in Kasese, they notified the DPC Kasese. However, the notice did not comply with the requirements of the law as provided for under Section 5 of the Public Order Management Act. On receipt of the notification, the Police asked the organisers for proof of consent from the owner of the premises where the meeting was scheduled to be held - Nyakasanga Playground. The organisers were not able to produce evidence of consent from the owner of the premises.

It is a fact that the organisers approached the Kasese Municipal Council offices and requested for the use of the premises at Nyakasanga Playground for the meeting scheduled on Saturday, 29 March 2014. The Town Clerk responded that Nyakasanga Playground was already committed for a Youth Sports Tournament from Saturday 29th to Sunday, 30 March 2014. See the letter attached hereon as annexure ‘A’. Having failed to secure the consent of the owner of the premises, the Police could not allow the meeting to be convened as this would have clashed with other activities earlier planned.

After failing to get Nyakasanga grounds, the organisers approached the Diocese of Kasese requesting to use their Social Services Grounds as venue for the meeting. The owners of the premises gave a number of conditions amongst which was proof of no objection from the Police. Indeed the Police gave their no objection but the organisers still failed to get the consent to use these particular premises due to their inability to satisfy the other conditions set by the owner. This is also attached as annexure ‘B’.

This elaboration clearly explains the role the Police played in executing their mandate under the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, the Public Order Management Act and other related legislations. As long as organisers of public meetings follow the right procedures under the law, their meetings will be convened and appropriately secured. Where the provisions of the law are not followed, still the Police will follow the law and will not permit laws to be broken by their acquiescence.

The claim that the organisers notified the Minister for Internal Affairs in Mbale cannot hold water because the person to be notified according to the law is the Inspector-General of Police.

Hon. Members, the mandate of the Uganda Police Force is clearly stated. The Uganda Constitution of 1995 (Article 212) and the Police Act Cap 303, mandate the Uganda Police Force to; 
Protect life and property;
Preserve law and order;
Prevent and detect crime; 
Coordinate with civilian authority and other security organs established under this Constitution and with the population generally.

I wish, therefore, to state that the procedure for the convening of a public meeting under the Public Order Management Act, 2013 is clearly specified in Section 5 of the Act and is as follows:

 “(a) The notice should be in writing and should reach the Inspector-General of Police or other authorised officers like the DPC or RPC at least three days before the proposed date of the public meeting.

“(b) The notice shall be in form A – which is in the Public Order Management Act – Schedule 2 of the Act Annex C. 
c) 	The notice should include the full name, physical and postal address of the organiser, his or her immediate contacts. It should also include consent from the owner of the venue, the proposed date and time of the meeting, the site of the meeting, the estimated number of persons expected and the purpose of the meeting.
d) 	In the absence of Form A, mentioned above, the organiser shall give notice in writing, containing the information required under Form A. The notice to be given shall be in triplicate and copies shall be given to the applicant and the proprietor of the venue where the meeting is to be held.
e) 	After receipt of the notice, the authorised officer shall, in writing, within 48 hours, inform the organiser if it is not possible to hold the proposed meeting.
f) 	In the event that the organiser is aggrieved by the decision of the authorised officer, he may appeal to the Magistrate’s Court in whose jurisdiction the meeting is to take place.

	Any organiser who contravenes these requirements commits an offence under the Public Order Management Act, 2013.”

Madam Speaker, the doctrine and normal standard of operating procedures of the Uganda Police Force in managing public disorder is as follows: Dialogue between the organisers and the Police; deployment of Police officers; caution by way of proclamation; dispersal starts with the foot drills charging with batons and shields, manoeuvres and then other non-lethal methods as the last resort and; lastly, they may arrest.

Hon. Members, the Public Order Management Act, 2013 is recently enacted into law. The instrument announcing the commencement date of the law was published in the Uganda Gazette on 18 November 2013. The law became effective on the 20th. Madam Speaker, I lay on Table the Gazette about this law.

Madam Speaker, there is therefore need for all stakeholders to internalise it across the country so that the people and their leaders can have a better understanding of this law. The Uganda Police Force has already embarked on sensitisation of all its personnel on its provisions and the responsibilities of the organisers and participants. I would like to appeal to all the concerned stakeholders organising such public meetings to inform the participants about the essential requirements of this law, especially on their responsibilities.

We ask for a closer cooperation with all the stakeholders so that the public meetings are organised in an orderly and peaceful manner. On our part, the government will continue to engage the members of the Opposition and the civil society through the National Consultative Forum and other avenues. We appeal to all stakeholders, including the Opposition to cooperate.

On the murders in Kiryadongo District, 10 cases have been registered from December 2013 to date –(Interjection)– Can I be protected, Madam Speaker? 11 suspects in six cases reported have appeared in court. The status of the investigation is summarised in Annex B and as the Ministry of Internal Affairs, we have decided, in addition to the measures already taken, to undertake the following measures:
A team comprising special investigators and a Flying Squad have been formed to reinforce investigations and operation in Kiryadongo District. Police is to expedite and conclude investigations on the reported murders.
Police is to enhance patrols within and along the highway in Kiryadongo District.
There is enhanced intelligence on the ground and should there be need, joint patrols with the Army will be carried out in the district.
The district security committee sits more regularly to address the crimes and security threats in this district.
Intensified political mobilisation by the RDC to sensitise and ensure that the people respect the rule of law.
The Police to liaise and coordinate with various stakeholders in the fight against crime in the country through the enhancement of community policing.

Madam Speaker, I will now go through our undertakings with the leaders of the Opposition, as instructed by your chair.

A STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT BY THE MINISTER FOR INTERNAL AFFAIRS ON THE OUTCOME OF THE DISCUSSION HELD BETWEEN THE MEMBERS AND LEADERS OF THE OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES HELD AT KOLOLO ON THE 2ND APRIL 2014

The meeting was held following requests for a meeting with the Minister of Internal Affairs by some leaders of the Opposition under the umbrella of the “Call for Free and Fair Elections Now.” It was convened in my office and the government delegation was led by I, with Ambassador Baba and the IGP while the Opposition leadership was led by Ambassador Otunnu.

My team and I welcomed the Opposition leaders and appreciated their desire for dialogue on peace, security and safety of the people in Uganda. I assured the meeting that the government has no intention of prohibiting the enjoyment of rights and freedoms of Opposition politicians as portrayed by the media reports and perceived by the leaders of the Opposition. I noted that in all activities that Police is involved in, the major consideration is execution of its mandate provided for under the Constitution and other legislation like the Public Order Management Act. 

I further emphasised the need for communication and called upon the Opposition politicians’ commitment to observe law and order, especially the Public Order Management Act, and the Constitution in the conduct of their meetings.

The head of the Opposition team appreciated Government’s gesture to accept their request for a meeting and hospitality. They raised a number of concerns and challenges encountered with the Police, which included use of unreasonable force, unprofessional conduct of some of the officers and some cases of denial to conduct their public meetings.

Our Resolutions

Madam Speaker, after the deliberations, the two sides resolved as follows:
The two sides concurred that the Public Order Management Act, 2013 is a good law and should be adhered to.
The public meetings planned to be held in Nebbi, Arua, Kitgum, Lira and Gulu should be held subject to observance of the law.
The Opposition agreed to furnish the IGP with the programme for the meetings of today – that is 3rd in Nebbi and we agreed with them and I know that this meeting should have taken place.
The Police leadership should continue to sensitise all police officers and the wider public on the new law – the Public Order Management Law, 2013.
The Opposition should also let their participants know the essential requirements of law, especially on their duties and responsibilities during the public meetings.
The Police undertake to investigate reported cases for misconduct of Police officers during Kabale, Mbale, and Soroti incidents as they were reported. They will be thoroughly investigated and the report will be made available.
The Opposition was specifically tasked to caution their participants and their agents to desist from assaulting and pelting police officers and tearing police attire. 
The parties agreed to appoint a contact person on either side and to hold periodic dialogue and the names of those who attended are attached. Thank you, Madam Speaker and hon. Members. 

THE SPEAKER: Thank you, honourable minister. Let us have two minutes from each.

MR JACK WAMANGA-WAMAI (FDC, Mbale Municipality, Mbale): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I want to thank the Minister of Internal Affairs for his statement. I will only speak about Mbale where I was the host. I want to tell you, hon. Minister that this statement – especially in paragraph 4 is full of lies. When I became a Member of Parliament, I took oath to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth. On Friday, 21 March 2014, the regional police commander, Jacob Opolot called me at 11.00 O’clock in the night and assured me that my meeting would go ahead in a town hall; not in a playground as I had requested before. And he told me that he was going to Manafwa where they were going to hold party elections for the NRM and his DPC was going to be in charge. 

On Saturday morning, I went to the town hall where we were going to hold this meeting. People were seated peacefully. I went back home to pick some of my visitors who were at my house. When I was at my house, someone called me saying that the Regional Police Commander had come and dispersed everybody. This shocked us. We rushed to the place and found the Police had cordoned off the place. 

I talked to the Regional Police Commander himself who had assured me of the meeting. Now I wondered why he had come to stop the meeting. The answer I got was that he had been directed from above. So they dispersed us. 

Now, while people were trying to drive away, they went and stationed the police vehicles in the way. People who were driving back to Kampala were not allowed to go. Maj. Gen. Muntu; hon. Wafula Oguttu, the Leader of the Opposition and all the people who had come to Mbale to attend this meeting were not allowed. The Police started dispersing everybody and firing teargas and even shooting live bullets. Hon. Minister, I laid shells here the other day on the Table of Parliament. I did not see anybody in Mbale pelt a stone at a police officer at all. 

Madam Speaker, I request the Minister of Internal Affairs – now that you are in charge of the Police – the Police had made it very complicated for us to hold meetings. Even in Geneva, Uganda is condemned every year because of the behaviour of the Police. Today as I speak, the President is in Brussels attending the AU/EU conference. The journalists are running after him and asking him about the violation of human rights in Uganda. This is because of the Police. So, I request that you take charge of the Police that they do not use excessive force, shooting and using live bullets at innocent people. In Mbale, there was nobody who threw a stone. We were seated peacefully and they came and dispersed us. So whatever you read here was just written for you and they are just lies. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 

8.24
MR JOSEPH SSEWUNGU (DP, Kalungu County West, Kalungu): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am sorry to say that the Gen. Aronda I know, who pacified Masaka, is now getting into mere politics. You are running away from your professional ethics of the Army. The good work you have done is being affected by that ministry you are holding now. What you have read here is what we refuted in the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs. 

Secondly, Gen. Aronda, why haven’t you talked about the radio issues? Why stop me to go for a talk show in the evening and claim that I am mobilising people. Why didn’t you tell us about what you discussed yesterday with our presidents about the RDCs and DPCs causing this confusion? This is what you said yesterday; why don’t you put that in writing? You are just putting here names claiming that my President Mao signed. This is not true, Gen. Aronda. You are not the real person I knew and I am praying for you; I am praying that you slowly run out of that thing. 

Gen. Mugisha Muntu was your boss; you know his conduct. Even I am an organised person, very peaceful and I cannot cause commotion. Why don’t you look at the chance – you saw how these presidents went to Mbarara; did they cause any commotion? When they were in Mbale, why didn’t you just provide them with enough security? 

Madam Speaker, the major problem in this saga is the RDC and DPCs. In the Police Force there is no problem and you just said it in your own communication to us here. What role did you play to convey the message to the person concerned? That is why Gen. Kayihura is saying that a minister has no power – the Minister of Internal Affairs fails? If I cannot get Gen. Kale Kayihura or the Regional Police Commander and I write to you, how can you just say, “I have no authority?” That means Kayihura is stronger than the minister; Attorney-General, can you advise us on this?

So, as I conclude, we need to seek change in these matters; we need electoral reforms. They bring Mambas; even if they have given you permission, they first surround you with Mambas to scare away the people. When did the RDC become one of the people supposed to give permission? Hon. Osegge relocated to her hotel but was still stopped from going to her home. Can you do that? You come and do it in Kalungu and you will see my people; they will not run away. They will fight you until you say, “Ssewungu meet your people” because these people always go through the right procedure. They have written to you; you are the minister. Once you get the letter, it is even a shaming to say that – (Member timed out_)

8.27
MR WILLIAM NZOGHU (FDC, Busongora County North, Kasese): Madam Speaker, I want to concentrate on the letters presented here from Kasese. Gen. Aronda, I used to hear that you are a very diligent man who is honest and committed to your work but I am shocked that you are joining the bandwagon of thuggery in the operations. But I want to remind you, General, that even the best Generals in the world have been disciplined at some point. I also want to remind you that if it were – (Interruption) 

MS KABAKUMBA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Is it in order for the hon. Member to personally attack another honourable member? Is it not possible for us to debate in a civil manner and debate issues rather than make personal attacks? 

THE SPEAKER: Anyway, I do not know his knowledge of the general. He seems to know him in other ways. Please conclude. 

MR NZOGHU: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am focusing on this because they know very well that they went to the bush. Unfortunately, they have come with the bush mentality. I want to refer to a letter we wrote on 20th March. We informed the Police about this meeting that was supposed to take place on 29th. We approached the Police and they told us the venue was available. We even went on to pay for that venue but after presenting to them the receipt of payment, they turned round after six days and said the venue had been booked. This is very unfortunate.

When you read the letter from the Kasese Catholic Social Services – Madam Speaker, this is what the letter reads and it is addressed to the Chairman for Forum for Democratic Change. It was written on 27th after we had informed the Police on 20th. The letter reads thus: “This note serves to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 27 March 2014 in which you are seeking permission to use the social services ground. In response to this, I task your office to first prove to us that you have been authorized by: (i) The Office of the President (RDC); (ii) the District Police Commander; and (iii) the law governing public rallies. It will be after receiving communication from the above offices that I will get back to you. Yours Rev. Fr Remegious Thembo.”

Madam Speaker, it is very ambiguous because instead of asking who to give the permission, the owner of the venue is saying he cannot give us the venue even when it was available. Why? The RDC rang the Bishop of Kasese Catholic Dioceses that don’t give them the venue. The DPC then replied to say thus: “In consultation with the Regional Police Commander, we as the Police have no objection. They allowed us to use social services…” So, is it the duty of the Police to know that there is a venue called Kasese Social Services or it is Kasese Social Services ground management that was supposed to inform us that their venue wasn’t available? Those are two pertinent questions.

But also, the import of this law was really to –(Member timed out.)

MR SAM OTADA (Independent, Kibanda County, Kiryandongo): Madam Speaker, may I seek your guidance because I am in a deep dilemma. The two reports have been presented at the same time, which is unprecedented in this House. I don’t want to be a spoiler of a good case because I strongly associate myself with the feelings of my friends, as far as the treatment they have been getting from the Police is concerned and to bring in the issues of Kiryandongo, which will be completely different, is to water down this passionate debate. So, may I seek your guidance on whether I can make comments in regard to Kiryandongo issues?

THE SPEAKER: No, I think it will be a bit difficult to relate the two arguments because they touch different issues and circumstances. Let us defer the issue of Kiryandongo to Tuesday. Let us concentrate on this one and finish it.

MR OTADA: Most obliged, Madam Speaker. But just a few comments: The law is there for all of us to follow to the greatest extent possible. But the other thing that works, which even the General acknowledges is really coordination – picking a telephone call, calling a colleague and agreeing on some of these issues. I want to report, Madam Speaker, that I do not know the experience of some of you as far as getting in touch with some of our colleagues, is concerned but I personally have a big problem. I have failed to get in touch with some leaders and I have nothing to hide. Gen. Aronda is one of them. 

One time Gen. Aronda came to this House and I wrote a note to him saying that I had been calling him and that there has been receipt of my calls for the last five months and I cannot get you; to discuss some of these issues as colleagues and talk about them or even pre-empt them as opposed to coming to talk about them after they have gone very bad. 

Madam Speaker, very frankly speaking because some of these things are very personal to us and they affect our lives. I asked Gen. Aronda that is it because I opposed your appointment as minister that you cannot give me the service that I deserve?  I said that to him. So, for me –

THE SPEAKER: But hon. Otada, you have now gone to something completely different. The issues we are discussing concern the events in Mbale, Kasese and Soroti.

MR OTADA: Yes, and I am relating it in the sense that a colleague raised – and I think that was hon. Gonzaga Ssewungu – that you can speak to one another. You can establish a way of communicating so that we don’t come here and begin saying this is the straight jacket of the law and that whoever does not follow it will get this kind of treatment. I am simply saying that there is a softer side of things as we manage society. Can we –(Member timed out_)

8.36
MS ANGELLINE OSEGGE (FDC, Woman Representative, Soroti): Thank you so much, Madam Speaker. I would like to begin from where hon. Owor Otada stopped that we can talk to each other. According to the evidence that will be tabled by hon. Muwanga Kivumbi about the letters that we wrote and the DPC acknowledged receiving the letter dated 19th – the follow up meeting on 22nd was upon my arrival. After calling him on telephone, I decided to walk into his office. When the councillor delivered that letter, they tactfully refused to acknowledge its receipt so when the days pass they would say the letter had been delivered late. But the date on the letter is evident.

Madam Speaker, it is important in this country that we learn to tell the truth. It doesn’t hurt to tell the truth. The Bible is very clear; the truth will set you free. When we tried to conduct that meeting – even after discussing the matter with the DPC – and they cordoned off the place we had proposed to meet, we decided to go to different areas of worship. We spent the whole day in churches sharing with the communities in there. Actually, we got to meet more people than we would have met at the venue but what surprised me is that after the service – as we moved to my hotel, which you know, to have lunch, we found the Police had stationed their vehicles across the gate refusing me to enter my own hotel. Now you know that that is a public place and so there were other guests who were residents in that hotel at that time. They blocked the gate and nobody was going out or coming in. When I told them to let me get in, they refused. I had to tell the staff to open another gate that is usually closed and that is how we got in. But still they came and blocked it as well.

Madam Speaker, I have a short girl to whom they threw a teargas canister directly and her bums got burnt. They threw other canisters onto the roof of my hotel and it got destroyed. A police officer at short range threw a teargas canister at my seat. You know how close the road is to the gate; I was at the gate and they threw a teargas canister but you know the Bible is true that no weapon formed against me shall prosper. The teargas burnt my gomesi but it did not touch my body and I have kept it; I didn’t wash it. 

Madam Speaker, I don’t know which law the minister is referring to that allows the Police to stop people from accessing their premises. Stopping me from meeting whoever I choose to meet and to host guests. Madam Speaker, I intend to go to court because my business was destroyed. I have a case for loss of business, destruction of property and trespass.

8.42
MR PAUL MWIRU (FDC, Jinja West Municipality, Jinja): Thank you so much, Madam Speaker. First, I want to pose a question to the minister, my friend hon. Aronda. Did you consult ‘above’ while agreeing on these resolutions? Because more often than not we have agreed with DPCs, RPCs and then they tell you they have got orders from above actually to disallow the meeting. The point I am making is that from the discussions and the deliberations of members and from these resolutions, I see very many things which can bring us together than those which can separate us. I only wonder; I don’t know why you concentrate on the bad things and they take much of your time that actually you must narrow the space for us to operate. 

We have just dealt with  a motion about Northern Uganda and Gen. Aronda, I want to go on record that once you close all these gaps, of course we shall reach there, there is no doubt about that. I will give an example of Jinja; I have been operating very well with the RPC and DPC and even when they have a problem they call me and say, “Look, your boys in this area are causing a problem.” On 23rd I was going for a small meeting, the RPC called me that with all these things taking place in the country, they have changed the entire dynamics so you cannot even meet. I told him I am a Member of Parliament; he said, “No, you cannot meet.” I said this is unacceptable. So I told him he either causes a scene or we discuss and agree to have a meeting. When we were in the meeting, nothing happened.  The point I am making, hon. Aronda, is that we need to narrow some of these issues which actually take place. In case you leave your officers to go on their own frolic and cause problems, you are causing a big problem to the entire country. When I see you humiliating my leader, when my people see you humiliating me, I don’t think they take it in good faith – (Member timed out_)

8.42
MR MILTON MUWUMA (NRM, Kigulu County South, Iganga): Thank you so much, Madam Speaker. I want to thank the minister for the attempt he took to ensure that at least these parties meet. This is the way to go. When I look at the list of the key party leaders in this country having a joint meeting, I see a ray of hope of where we need to go. I want to appeal and pray to both sides of this House to push and promote this. Dialoguing is the way to go; we may be able and we shall be able to solve problems ahead of us.

About sensitisation on the public order management law, it is necessary. I was surprised when I interacted with the district councillors who also believed to date that even if you have a funeral or an introduction ceremony you have to go and get permission from the Police. That shows that this law has not yet been appreciated and understood by key stakeholders in this country. So sensitisation is inevitable, we need to do it. All of us should take lead in this cause but dialogue is the way to go. 

Madam Speaker, like you have guided that hon. Otada’s issue be addressed next week, I want also to request the minister that they include issues like the murder of Namazzi in this case at Namasuba because it is causing suspicion and fear that we have modern terrorism that is attacking the country because the family still gets threats and we need to address these issues. Then the Rakai cannibal who killed and ate - if at all it is true – but we were told evidence is there. The cannibals have to be brought to book but as Parliament, we need to get updates on how far the Police have gone with these matters. 

8.44
MR TONNY AYOO (NRM, Kwania County, Apac): Thank you, Madam Speaker. In response to issues here, first of all, I want to say this to the Minister of Internal Affairs that when you look at the events that have been happening, you clearly realise that the problem is not the law but the people who are trying to implement this law, trying to meddle up and trying to take it for a game. These are the RPCs, DPCs and the RDCs. I want to appeal to you that you restrain them to act within the law because if you have cleared a meeting, you do not have to turn around again in the morning to cause commotion and fracas for nothing. I think this is where we need to take it seriously. 

At the same time, I want to urge members of the Opposition that we shouldn’t appear to be opposing the Public Order Management Act the way we did it in the Bill because the message that has gone out, people are trying to test the strength of the Act, to oppose it unnecessarily and even not follow the procedure because like in the Mbale case - in Kasese, I have seen documents but the one of hon. Wamanga Wamai, I don’t see him presenting any document that he has put but he said that he was called on phone. So, when you turn to using telephone calls and yet you are supposed to sign – (Interruption)

MS OSSEGE: Madam Speaker, it surprises me that a colleague can rise up and say a Member of Parliament should be subject to the conditions in the Public Order management Act. We categorically said here in their normal course of duty; that should have been taken into consideration. There is no way a Member of Parliament who is naturally supposed to be dealing and meeting with people will keep on going to the Police and we dealt with that in the Act clearly. Is the hon. Member therefore in order to insinuate that we should be following the Public Order Management Act? Is he in order, Madam Speaker?

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, it is difficult to take into account the composition of the group. I don’t know whether it was really a Member of Parliament addressing a meeting or a group of people addressing meetings. So you are bound to obey the law. If it is a public meeting please obey the law.

MR WAMANGA-WAMAI: The law is very clear, you inform the Police and I did inform the Police. They advised that don’t hold a public rally outside but in a town hall and they told me it was okay. I told the Police to please keep peace and order and they allowed. And that is what is in the Public Order Management law. That you inform the Police, which I did and he called me back confirming. 

THE SPEAKER: Therefore, you complied with the Public Order Management Act.

MR WAMANGA-WAMAI: I did.

MR AYOO: Thank you, Madam Speaker. There is a call for free and fair elections now and this is what we are talking about that has been moving all over the place. In other places, the meetings have been successful because they have done due diligence, they have cooperated with the Police and they have written. So, where the meetings have not been successful, it means there was a problem that needed to be worked on and corrected on the side of the Police and the organisers of elections. This is clear; we must face facts and reality and move on because nobody is above the law.

8.49
MR JACOB OPOLOT (NRM, Pallisa County, Pallisa): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I want to first state that I have not known social, biological or any other connection with the Opolot Jacob who was mentioned as RPC Mbale because I wouldn’t want anybody to mistake that we could be related in any way. We only happen to share a name. I want us to be very honest with ourselves; you know every time we are building the country and everything we do has consequences. Personally, I sympathise with the Opposition for the experience, it is unfortunate but I wish to appeal to the Minister of Internal Affairs to tame the Police for the good of this country. The Army has been tamed but the Police has been left loose and there are so many terrible things happening. I will give you an example. 

Last year in August in Pallisa, there was a simple demonstration over the Tirinyi-Pallisa-Kumi Road and trucks of Policemen were taken there with teargas. They went on teargasing market vendors who were about a kilometre away from where the riot was. They ended up teargasing a crippled fellow saying that they were chasing people who had been at the scene of the riot. Would you expect a crippled fellow to quickly run back to his workplace where he was mending shoes and justify the action of the Police?
I think we should be conscious that what we are doing today will determine the society we shall have tomorrow and it might be a more dangerous society. I would appeal to the General to please save our future by taming the Police because if you do not, you are nurturing a very dangerous community. I would not want to look at it from the perspective of the Opposition. Let us look at it from the perspective of Uganda.

Madam Speaker, give me another minute to give an example. Recently, there was money released to Pallisa District local Government to construct a multipurpose production unit. There happened to be land which the local administrative Police was partially occupying before it was reintegrated into the Central Police. This land was allocated to the contractor to construct a unit but the DPC of Pallisa pronounced that in the handover report of his predecessor, this land had been allocated to the local administrative Police. Mark you there are other departments also occupying that land including Forestry. When they disagreed with the council and the council was going to hand over the - (Member timed out_)

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL INDUSTRY AND FISHERIES (ANIMAL INDUSTRY) (Mr Bright Rwamirama): Thank you, Madam Speaker. It is regrettable that Ugandans at this time find themselves in such a chaotic manner. I want to be rational. There are some police officers who may be undisciplined and I am happy Gen. Aronda has put up a disciplinary committee where people can report incidences of this nature. But also some of us politicians have a problem and I have seen it on Bukedde TV; I am a retired Colonel of the Army but a Police Constable will stop me and I will stop. Why we have not had incidents in this House and in the precincts of Parliament is because the Police here have been very active. They come here very early in the morning and secure the place. It is good that we work with the Police and identify mistakes. We have Gen. Aronda and so many people we can refer to so that we sort ourselves out because we can have a problem in this country. We have seen aeroplanes just disappearing and nobody can trace them. The current trend as to why we have not had incidents here is because our security forces have been very active. Yes, my brother it is not lax, the people have been very active but we need to identify the bad elements in the Police. 

Also, as Members of Parliament who make the laws, we also need to respect them. I have seen some Members of Parliament urging people to beat the Police. I have seen here one Member of Parliament - Madam Speaker if you remember, the Police requested him to go and make a statement at the Police. The hon. Member decided to lie down so they looked at each other. They had opened the door of the cab for him to enter in front but when they looked at each other - when you lift somebody certainly you put him on his back. We need to behave as Members of Parliament and deal with our security because we are all concerned. Otherwise disobeying the law also can be a problem. I am calling for dialogue so that we sort out this issue of mishandling citizens and also citizens mishandling Police.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you.

MR MUHAMMAD MUWANGA KIVUMBI (DP, Butambala County, Butambala): Madam Speaker, two issues must be made clear. One, I sit on the committee that organises this call for free and fair elections in Uganda and you know I coordinate most of them. Two, I was privileged to be in a meeting that we attended with Gen. Aronda and I am an honest to goodness democrat in this country.

In the second statement, we never said that the Public Order Management law was a good one but we did say it is the law of the land. We have petitioned court but we are aware it is a law applicable now and we are under obligation to follow it.

To emphasise our point, at the very start of this campaign, we decided to officially write to the Minister of Internal Affairs that we were going to undertake a nationwide campaign and I have a copy of the letter. We copied that same letter to the Inspector General of Police and notified all our organisers at grassroots level to follow the requirements of the Public Order Management Act.

Apart from Masaka which was a public rally, the rest of the gatherings were indoor town hall meetings so they could not, in any way, interfere with lawful business and the rights of others. Attendance was by invitation and we went on well with the many conditions until we reached Bushenyi. We started off well in Makerere, went to Jinja, Mbarara –(Member timed out_)

THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Mr Phillip Wafula Oguttu): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I attended yesterday’s meeting and I also participate in the meetings of the leaders in the free and fair elections call. We had a good meeting yesterday with the minister and the IGP. We agreed on a number of things, some of them have been captured here by the hon. minister accurately and some of them wrongly, the first one as he pointed, out of good law. The Shadow Minister has corrected that. There is No. 6 which was never discussed. We never discussed that we should stop participants assaulting and pelting Police officers because we have never seen that happen since we began these meetings.

We do not know where to appeal but the issue of RDCs – they are the major problem of confusion. The RDCs are civil servants paid by the taxpayer from the Consolidated Fund and they are not supposed to be involved in politics but apparently, they are also politicians and they are all the time in campaign mood. They are the people who are causing this confusion.

Madam Speaker, I have been sitting here quietly and I noticed that people from the opposite side talk as much as they like but here –

THE SPEAKER: Are you accusing the Speaker? You are really accusing the Speaker.

MR WAFULA OGUTTU: I am much obliged, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: No, please withdraw it.

MR WAFULA OGUTTU: I have withdrawn it. I am sorry about that. The law requires us to get permission from owners of the venue and we follow that. The development now is going to be difficult for us and I dare say that maybe when we begin campaigns – the owners of venues are threatened and they do not want to give us venues. We fear that when the campaigns come, it is possible that even school head teachers will never allow us to do campaigns - unless this is checked, the question of RDCs and the question of using the law to threaten owners of venues.

The last point that I want to make is on the issue of radio stations. It was not under any law that people were removed from radio stations – the leaders of parties like Gen. Muntu and Bishop Zac Niringiye were removed from - and all radio stations switched off. There was no law that was used. 

We discussed this with the minister and he conveniently has not talked about it in this report. It is a matter that must also be addressed. Otherwise, we pray that this dialogue we have done can continue as hon. Muwuma prayed so that we can move events and issues in our country more and more in a bipartisan manner instead of confrontation. I thank you very much.

THE SPEAKER: Minister, do you have any closing remarks?

THE MINISTER FOR INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Gen. Aronda Nyakairima): Thank you, Madam Speaker.  We are all working for a stable country. That is our determination that we operate in a secure and peaceful Uganda. All that we are saying is that let each one of us do their part.

Now on the issue of radio stations, we agreed, hon. Leader of the Opposition that the law on the media will apply and it will no longer be on our back to go there and switch off when someone is there. The media law will apply. 

On the point of dialogue, it is the way to go. As we dialogue, we will promote a democratic culture that is very useful for all of us to have a level ground, harmony and really everyone doing one’s part so that we do not begin thinking that there are those who should do their work and others do not. So, we appeal to you for coordination and communication. 

Hon. Otada, for the record, I personally have nothing against you. That was my issue and it is part of history. My phone is there for hon. Otada. Hon. Otada cannot remember when there is a problem. Let us talk all the time - (Laughter). I will join you and we will sort out all those problems that have come up.

RDCs are there for all of us. (Interjections) They are doing their work, helping you in development activities. They are helping you on security. If there is anyone with some indiscipline tendencies or whatever, the Minister for the Presidency is there; there are senior leaders here. So, please, let us know. But please, work with the RDCs because they are team players and they will really help you.

Finally, Madam Speaker, we are committed to ensuring that all those who committed crimes in Kibanda will be brought to book just like how others have already been arrested. All these other cases, I agreed with our counterparts there that we maintain a structured dialogue and I am waiting for them to give me time to meet again. I thank you.

MR WAMANGA-WAMAI: Clarification?

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Minister, my final word is not related to the political rallies. I just want to appeal for restraint on all sides but especially the overzealous use of tear gas in any circumstance. For instance, Kamuli is an NRM area but my colleague here brought a complaint about a dispute in a taxi park where two groups had difficulties discussing and tear gas was thrown into the taxi park and one of the citizenry lost a hand. So, we should really do something about the overzealous use of tear gas. We can use other means but not tear gas.

Hon. Members, I want to thank you very much for the work done. We have stayed quite long. The House is adjourned to Tuesday at 2.00 p.m. I thank you very much.

(The House rose at 9.07 p.m. and adjourned until Tuesday, 8 April 2014 at 2.00 p.m.)
