PRAYERS

(The Deputy Speaker, Ms Rebecca Kadaga, in the Chair.)

The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I would like to welcome you to today’s meeting. I have three issues to communicate. The first one is that we had instructed the Minister of Internal Affairs to issue a statement on the affairs of Mengo and Police et cetera, and also the events that occurred in Busoga on Monday; but yesterday we were not satisfied with the content of his statement and so we have asked him to go and complete it. 

This morning I received information that consultations are going on and the MPs from Buganda will be invited to go and discuss the matter with the President tomorrow at 4 p.m. So, since that part of the statement is pending consultation, we shall hold on. 

About Busoga, he said he was still doing his research and so the statement will not come this morning -

MR MIGEREKO: So, I am not a liar. (Laughter)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The second matter is sad. Our colleague, Hon. Okello Oryem, the Minister of State for International Co-operation, has lost his sister. She has been working at our Mission in London, but she has been sick. She has died; and I would like to request the House to stand up and observe a minute of silence.

(The Members rose and observed a moment of silence.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The third issue is that we asked the Budget Committee and the Ministry of Finance to harmonise their figures. I hope that in your motion you will be able to explain to us what you have done so that you ease our work.

11.24
MR GEOFREY EKANYA (FDC, Tororo County, Tororo): Madam Speaker, I want to thank you very much. I rise up on a point of guidance concerning the Buganda issue and His Majesty, the Kabaka’s trip. This matter does not only concern MPs from Buganda. Some of us are married here in Buganda and we have property in Buganda. 

Also, this matter is a constitutional matter. If tomorrow Papa Emorimor is stopped from going to Jinja, then it will concern MPs from Teso, and if the Kyabazinga is stopped from going to Kamuli then it will become an issue for the MPs from Busoga. But this is a national matter. So, I want us to request you to communicate to the President that we need a statement on the Floor of the House and that he should avoid tribalising constitutional matters.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Actually, I am talking to you because I spoke to him this morning concerning that matter. I am equally concerned that it is a Uganda matter. But my colleagues had threatened to walk out of the House. So, he will meet them but they will come back to us because the matter is for the whole country. They will have to come back to us.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Madam Speaker, we want to thank you very much that you communicated to the President. The MPs from Buganda have been called because they threatened to walk out. What about us who have not threatened to walk out as a result of these activities taking place outside? Wouldn’t it have been better for us to get a statement telling us how our cultural leaders are being handled?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Nandala-Mafabi, I am very concerned and that is why I insisted that I want a comprehensive statement. Yesterday the minister came with a statement and I was not satisfied with it. That is why I said, “I want a comprehensive statement on what is going on in Buganda and what is going on in Busoga.” But we should not stop the MPs from Buganda from going to discuss that matter. However, that does not mean that government will not come back to us with a statement. They have to come back. 

MR KABUUSU: Thank you, Madam Speaker. This morning I was tipped that Members of Parliament from Buganda, particularly members subscribing to the National Resistance Movement, will meet the President. But in your communication it sounded like it was all Members of Parliament from Buganda.

I also have a message that has been sent to one of us but it only specifies NRM Members of Parliament from Buganda. So, it is not clear. Can you clarify? 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am the Speaker for all the members, both NRM and the Opposition. I have clarified that you will all go for the meeting. This is what I am telling you – yes - to State House.

MR SEBUNYA: Madam Speaker, the information I have on my phone has been sent to me by hon. Sematiko and it clearly says, “Movement -(Interjections)- Buganda Caucus MPs are meeting the President at 4 p.m. tomorrow.” So, it is not for Movement only; it is Buganda Caucus. I thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: So, that one, no please! I have said all of you are my members and you are all going to the meeting - yes.

MR MATHIAS NSUBUGA: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. Yesterday as Parliament we asked this question to Government to clarify to the nation not to the political parties. 

Secondly, I am a Member of the Opposition, I am from Buganda and I am a Muganda, but I have not received any message inviting me to State House.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Nsubuga, I am saying that the whole of the Buganda Caucus Members of Parliament are going to State House. That is finished. Let us move on. The message is from me. Next item! 


MOTION THAT PARLIAMENT DO RESOLVE ITSELF INTO A COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY FOR CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION OF:

    I) THE REVISED REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2009/2010
    II) THE BUDGETARY PROPOSALS FOR THE ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2009/2010

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Ministry of Finance.

11.29
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Fred Omach): Madam Speaker and hon. colleagues, I move a motion that Parliament do resolve itself into a Committee of Supply for the consideration and approval of:

    1. The revised revenue and expenditure estimates for the fiscal year 2008/2009.
    2. The budgetary proposals for the estimates for the revenue and expenditure for the fiscal year 2009/2010.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Now why are the members leaving my office? They should not consult during my time. Really, I am seeing Members of Buganda Caucus running away, okay, you move. Okay, minister, move!

MR BADDA: Madam Speaker, I am seeking your indulgence upon guidance. It was an assurance made on the Floor of this House that the government was going to make a statement today.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Badda, I have already ruled on that matter. Please, Minister of Finance.

MR OMACH: Madam Speaker and colleagues, this House has debated the budgetary proposals for estimates of revenue and expenditure for the fiscal year 2009/2010 and the debates have been concluded. I pray that we move to the Committee of Supply. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Seconded.

COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY

Vote 001 - Office of the President

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Vote 001 - I put the question that the total sum of Shs 53,067,893,956 under Vote 001 - Office of the President, be provided for as recurrent expenditure for the Financial Year 2009/2010. 

MR ODUMAN OKELLO: Madam Chair, I know we had a meeting with our colleagues from the Budget Committee and chairpersons, but I do not know whether we should not have had something in circulation, which members should be referring to. What are we reading? Do members have anything? These are figures - 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Let me ask the minister to move a motion for resumption of the House so that we can suspend for 15 minutes and they circulate. Minister of Finance!

MOTION FOR THE HOUSE TO RESUME

11.38
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Fred Omach): Madam Chair, I move a motion for the House to resume.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I put the question that the House do resume and the Committee of Supply reports thereto. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

(The House resumed, the Deputy Speaker presiding.)

REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Minister of Finance.

11.39 
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Fred Omach): Madam Speaker, I am back to report that the Committee of Supply has considered the budget proposal for the Financial Year 2009/2010 and has not supplied it. (Laughter)

MOTION FOR ADOPTION OF THE REPORT 
FROM THE COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY

11.39
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Fred Omach): Madam Speaker, I beg to move that the report from the Committee of Supply be adopted. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I put the question that the House adopt the report of the committee. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

(Report adopted.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I suspend the proceedings until 12.00 so that the texts are distributed. 

(The House was suspended at 11.40 a.m.)

(On resumption at 12.42 p.m., the Deputy Speaker presiding_)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The House is called to order. I would like to confirm that the secretariat has issued a working document, which was requested for in the morning so that we can proceed. But before we do that I would want to ask the Minister of Finance to brief the House on the areas of contention that were remaining last night and which they have harmonised this morning.   

12.43
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Fred Omach): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker and colleagues. As the Deputy Speaker has indicated, the document, which is being supplied, is purely a working document to help us in the supply of the votes for the year 2009/10.

This morning we met with the chairpersons of committees to try to resolve some of the issues so that the figures we bring here will not have any discrepancies now that we have already completed the debates on the various ministerial policy statements. 

As you are aware, we have already, as Parliament supplied Votes for the Ministry Local Government and the Ministry of Public Service. We have also supplied the Votes for the ICT ministry, Ministry of Health and all the bodies under the Ministry of Health. 

We have also supplied for the Ministry of Education and all the universities and other institutions thereto. We have also supplied for Tourism, Trade and Industry and bodies affiliated to the Ministry. And finally, we have also supplied to State House. Since we have already supplied these Votes, we shall not therefore supply them again.

As I already mentioned this morning, chairpersons of sessional committees together with the Budget Committee and the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, the Minister of Works and Transport and the Minister of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries met and we did harmonise on a number of remaining Votes which are to be supplied this morning. 

We agreed as follows: Under Vote 118, on the Road Fund, we have agreed that so long as we appoint the accounting officer, this Vote can be supplied under the Road Fund. 

Accordingly, I would like to lay on the Table the instrument appointing an accounting officer for Vote 118, the Road Fund, for the Financial year 2009/10, and it is Mr Alex Kakooza, who is currently the Under Secretary in the Ministry of Works and Transport. 

Under Vote 008, Ministry of Finance, we agreed at a meeting this morning that the amount of Shs 3.424 billion, which was being voted under Ministry of Finance, moves to Vote 010, Ministry of Agriculture where it should be ring fenced for the purpose of paying severance packages for extension workers. This will have to be ring fenced to await utilisation for the severance of the services of the workers that will be taken over.  

We have also agreed under the Presidential Initiative on Bananas that the Shs 10.2 billion, which has been voted under Ministry of Finance, remains there. However, the Opposition requests that this Vote moves to Vote 142 under NARO. We did not agree to this. Our prayer is that this can still be supervised under the Ministry of Finance as has been done before and there is no need to move this under NARO. 

Still under Ministry of Finance, the issue of the capitalisation of Uganda Development Bank and the East African Development Bank of Shs 7 billion – First of all, as far as the East African Development Bank is concerned, we as the East African Community have agreed to be financing this until we finish increasing the capital and to this extent we are going to put up US $3 million and the balance will be going to the Uganda Development Bank.

Again here the Opposition requested that this money be put under NARO for issues of research. It is our considered opinion that we use this remaining money to capitalise the Uganda Development Bank and the East African Development Bank. The issue they are raising is that, there is need for a resolution of the board, and also a statutory instrument to be put in the Gazette - this could be done after we have supplied and, therefore, we shall be in compliance with the law. 

Under Foreign Affairs - Vote 006, we have a figure of Shs 1,733,000,000 debt that we talked about in this House, and this was meant to put up a market in Juba. 

As you will recall, the Republic of Uganda did play a great role in bringing peace and tranquility in Southern Sudan, and we have a lot of trade with Southern Sudan; and during the global economic crisis, our regional trade helped us to make the balance of payments, and we got in excess of US$ 500 million through trade with Sudan. It is our opinion that this amount of money should be left to handle the issue of this market.

However, we eventually agreed that the Vote-on-Account of Shs 570million which has already been sent to the Juba Mission be retained for this purpose, and the balance of Shs 1,163,000,000 be given to the various votes under Foreign Affairs missions abroad. 

There were issues under Vote 001 - Office of the President. Madam Speaker, under the Office of the President, the issue of the patriotism programme where we have proposed to allocate Shs 6.5 billion to enable us recruit assistant resident district commissioners – this issue was also debated in the meeting of this morning and the government side did clearly indicate the importance of this remaining under the Office of the President to enable mobilisation of the youth who are not necessarily in formal education. 

However, the Opposition prayed that this be taken to the Ministry of Education, and we said this is not the formal education that should go under the Ministry of Education and Sports. These are issues that we did debate.

Now, on the issue of the one-third for the extension workers under the Ministry of Agriculture, which was already under the Vote-on-Account given to the Ministry of Finance, we agreed that this should be sent to the Ministry of Agriculture. Madam Speaker, I beg to report.

12.54
MR IBRAHIM KADDUNABBI (NRM, Butambala County, Mpigi): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am standing on behalf of my colleagues, the members of parliament from Buganda region. Yesterday, we met as Members from Buganda region. The meeting was in regard to the current affairs surrounding the visit of His Majesty, the King of Buganda, to Kayunga District. We resolved that because there is a letter, purportedly from the Minister of Internal Affairs, advising His Majesty, the Kabaka, not to travel to Kayunga. We were also aware that the Minister of Information and National Guidance when she was addressing the media, said His Majesty is free to visit any part of his kingdom, including Kayunga. 

We were also aware that on Monday, when some youth were organising some stalls in Kayunga where His Majesty will be visiting, they were dispersed and thoroughly beaten – and some of them were arrested by the Police. 

We resolved, therefore, that the minister comes to this House with an official statement to help us, the leaders in Buganda, to know the actual position of Government. 

Yesterday I interacted with the Government Chief Whip, who addressed the press and promised that a statement was supposed to be made yesterday or today. Without the statement, we resolved that the Members of Parliament from Buganda will walk out of this Parliament until such a time that we are officially informed of the position of the Government of Uganda. 

Therefore, Madam Speaker, I would like on behalf of the Members of Parliament from Buganda region to express the feelings which we passed yesterday, and I would like to tell you that we shall be walking out of this Parliament after my statement. I thank you. (MPs walk out).

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us go to the Committee of Supply.

COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 
21.58
Vote 001 - Office of the President

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, I now put the question that the total sum of Shs 53,067,893,956 under Vote 001 - Office of the President, be provided for as recurrent expenditure for the financial year 2009/2010 –

DR EPETAIT: Madam Chairperson, during the debate on that particular committee report and also that on Social Services, we pointed out that the patriotism clubs, which are included under President’s Office, amounting to Shs 6.5 billion, lacked documentation and guidelines. Therefore, the House observed that we are ill-prepared for a programme, which has no guidelines. We were, therefore, moving that the sum of Shs 6.5 billion be removed from Vote 001.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, I was here when we attempted to deal with this matter. My understanding was that you were requesting that it moves from one vote to another. So, it was not the question of the function but the location. Also, there was a concept laid here, which I asked the Members to read one week ago.

MR ODUMAN: Madam Chair, we have had meetings and consultations over a lot of issues in these votes and as agreed and reported in the report of the Minister of Finance, there were some issues that remained outstanding, and we decided that these would be brought to the Committee of the Whole House. 

Whereas the matter was debated here, some principles came out that Members pronounced themselves on, and that included patriotism, the banana initiative and so on. Those are matters of principle and many Members expressed varying views. We believe that it will be up to this committee to decide on those ones because in the consultation that we had shortly before we came here, we didn’t have a common position like the minister rightly reported. We believe that this Committee of the Whole House will be the one to express its opinion on that.

We stand very strongly that patriotism clubs and the payments and monies for RDCs for that function would best be transferred to the sector that has capacity to develop curriculum and to train. We expressed reservations about ARDCs and RDCs and their capacity to be able to deliver any form of training because of their lack of training in that particular aspect. It is our position as the Opposition that, that money be transferred to the Ministry of Education. They will guide the nation on curriculum and on how to design a training programme. That is our prayer, Madam Chair.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Hon. Member, last time I asked a question, which nobody answered. I asked you how many young people are accounted for under Ministry of Education in the whole country. How many are in schools and how many are out of school? How will the Ministry of Education capture youth in Kisoro who are on boda boda? 

MR WADRI: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Nearly two weeks back, you asked that question and all I told you and this House was that at that time, I was not able to give a succinct figure of the youth who are beneficiaries of formal education, but later I was advised by the hon. Member representing the youth that there were eight million youth who were not beneficiaries of formal education. 

That being the position, we have a number of programmes run and delivered by various ministries in this government, which target the youth who are out of education. We have a number of programmes under Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development like the programme known as PCY (Promotion of Children and Youth) which is a formal project in that ministry. This project attracts the largest amount of money in that ministry and it reads in billions. 

Therefore, it is our considered opinion, as I reiterated the other time, that there is no justification whatsoever to begin having very many centre points and authority centres and to begin having the Ministry of Education scattered in various ministries in Government. The idea of saying that there is a special programme targeting the youth in form of patriotism clubs is a way of taking responsibility from the dockets of Ministry of Education. 

It is our considered opinion once again to say and appeal to this House that let us answer, reflect and be guided by our own individual conscience as to whether we are taking the right decision in as far as programming and running of Government ministries is concerned. If we follow this trend, tomorrow I will not be surprised that the ministries of Agriculture, Water or Lands begin to have their programmes scattered in various ministries over which the line minister will not have direct control. 

I once again repeat the plea that I made to this House a week and a half ago that, if we are so convinced that we need patriotism clubs for the youth in this country, let us do the most honourable thing; let us channel the resources to where they rightly belong and that is Ministry of Education. It is my suggestion that the Shs 6.5 billion, which is going to be allocated for operationalisation of activities of assistant RDCs, who are being targeted for this programme, be transferred to Ministry of Education. If it is transferred to Ministry of Education, we in Opposition will have no problem, but the way it is, I will shortly, depending on how this house proceeds, get up to make a statement. I thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Hon. Byanyima.

MR BYANYIMA: Madam Chairperson, I believe that when we are in this Parliament, we should respect each other. We took time off and sat in a meeting where we all agreed that the issue of patriotic clubs appeared in the MTEF and the Cabinet had a bit of time to go through it. We all agreed. This meeting was not to open up the debate; it is just on figures. If we are to open debate now, even people who were in America who have just come back to bring new ideas - I think it cannot work. (Laughter) Let us look at the figures now and move. Thank you

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of Shs 53,067,893,956 under Vote 001 - Office of the President, be provided for as recurrent expenditure for the financial year 2009/2010.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Vote 001, Office of the President

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total of sum of Shs 14,657,471,000 under Vote 001 - Office of the President, be provided as development expenditure for the financial year 2009/2010.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Vote 003 - Office of the Prime Minister 

MR WADRI: Madam Chair, I think as per the rules -

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: But I have not proposed, I do not know. What are you addressing?

MR WADRI: I am on a procedural matter.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: On what?

MR WADRI: I thought, Madam Chairperson, you had allowed me -

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: No, I have not.

MR WADRI: Have you ruled?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I have not allowed you. 

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Procedure

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Procedure on this? What rule?

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: How the House is being managed, Madam Chairperson.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of Shs 20,522,474,665 under Vote 003 - Office of the Prime Minister, be provided for as recurrent expenditure for the financial year 2009/2010.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total of Shs 124,094,809,089 under Vote 003 - Office of the Prime Minister, be provided for as development for the financial year 2009/2010.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Vote 004 - Ministry of Defence
 
THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of Shs 433,577,930,488 Vote 004 - Ministry of Defence, be provided for as recurrent expenditure for the financial year 2009/10.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of Shs 31,367,880,000 under Vote 004 - Ministry of Defence, be provided for as development expenditure for the financial year 2009/2010.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Vote 006 - Ministry of Foreign Affairs

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Yes, hon. Mawiya

MR MAWIYA: Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. I propose that Shs 210 million be added as recurrent expenditure to Vote 006 under Foreign Affairs so that it funds the joint permanent commissions. I beg to propose. This is drawn from the development expenditure of the High Commission in Juba which is Vote 229.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable, I am still dealing with the recurrent expenditure do not -

MR MAWIYA: Yes, Madam Chairperson. Yesterday Plenary passed a recommendation of the Committee for Foreign Affairs, that is under development expenditure, where we proposed to halt the construction of a market in Juba -

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: No, hon. Member. Can we finish with recurrent?

MR MAWIYA: Yes, because that recurrent under headquarters is affected by a reallocation from development expenditure of our Juba Mission.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: There is a vote for recurrent and a vote for development. Now, if you attack the recurrent, how will we pay the salaries?

MR EKANYA: Madam Chairperson, the proposal for the chairman is out of procedure because we have already passed a vote-on-account on that item. Secondly, we are dealing with recurrent; and thirdly, the work plan of Ministry of Foreign Affairs is very clear and it is the new guideline that we are using, that there must be a procurement plan and a work plan before we pass the budget. So, he is now distorting the entire budget and I think it is not acceptable. Let us pass the vote as it is.

MR OMACH: Madam Chairperson, as I mentioned earlier, we had agreed that Shs 1,733,000,000, which was meant for building the market in Juba, that we only utilise the Shs 570,000,000 to remain in the Juba Mission and the balance of Shs 1.163 billion be supplied to the various mission votes that the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee was reading.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I thought the Shs 1.733 was for the development expenditure; he wants a reallocation in this one. So, can we deal with the recurrent and deal with the development? 

MR MAWIYA: There is no problem if this Committee of Supply approves it. It is procedurally correct as long as the Committee of Supply agrees. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: But we can deal with it under the development budget.

MR MAWIYA: No, Madam Chairperson, because after this one, you will not come back to it. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Why do you want this money in recurrent?

MR MAWIYA: Madam Chairperson, there are joint permanent commissions which appear as planned activities under the headquarters; that is Vote 006, and this is an unfunded priority. We have had problems over the years, especially with our borders, for example, with DRC, Juba and Kenya. So, we are saying that this money be allocated from the vote under development expenditure; that is from Abuja, which we agreed with the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development –

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Hon. Minister, he wants to fund the joint permanent commissions; so he is looking for money to fund them. What do you say about that? I think it needs an upward adjustment and then a consequent reduction.

MR OMACH: Madam Chairperson, we did agree with the chair of the committee to give us the list of where he wants this 1.163 to go and that was one of the areas that we agreed upon. But I am yet to receive the lists of where they are supposed to go to. So, we may have to stand over this.

MR NGABIRANO: Madam Chairperson, we need to resolve first. Yesterday, in the report, the chairperson of the committee suggested that we reallocate money from development expenditure and we adopted the report. Now, if we are to change then we must first agree on that; whether the money which was meant to construct a market in Juba is going to be reallocated to recurrent expenditure. If it is so, then we have got to listen to the chairperson of the committee and adjust the figure accordingly. If not, then we have to make a decision on it. But we cannot proceed without resolving that question.

MR EKANYA: Madam Chairperson, this issue of the market of Juba was a presidential directive because the President constituted a committee of five senior ministers. The Ugandans trading in Juba are working in a state worse than Owino Market. The Kenyan Government was given land just like the Uganda Government and the Kenya Government built a road from Kenya to Juba, they have built a warehouse and a consultancy unit. The Shs 1.7 billion that the government is providing is not even enough.

Madam Chairperson, in terms of trade, Uganda gets US$ 500 million from Sudan annually and it is basically from agriculture from the regions of the East and North; there are Baganda in that place.  Therefore, I want to urge this House not to tamper with that money so that the construction of the market starts to benefit Ugandans. 

And this matter was even discussed during the Budget Committee and we disagreed with the chairman’s proposals because they are contrary to the rules. We have already passed part of the money in the Vote-on-Account. He is proposing that part of the money goes to Beijing - Shs 700 million; we were offered free land in Beijing. But Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development agreed to look for money to meet the requirement of Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided they come up with proper plans, but this money should go to the market in Juba. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of Shs 8,858,420,000 under Vote 006 - Ministry of Foreign Affairs, be provided for as recurrent expenditure for the financial year 2009/2010.

MR MAWIYA: Madam Chairperson, unless we are changing goal posts on how we move in this Parliament. Yesterday, Plenary adopted the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and our recommendation was that we know the mandate of Foreign Affairs; construction of markets is totally out of the mandate of Foreign Affairs.

We also said that in the absence of a legal regime and a policy on the acquisition, development and management of foreign assets, we cannot appropriate money. We agreed and plenary passed our report.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Hon. Chairman, yesterday when we passed that report the explanation we received from the Minister of Foreign Affairs was that Ugandans were operating in a dirty place but this morning I had the opportunity to talk to the Minister of Finance and he explained to me the benefits of the inputs into this economy from the traders in Sudan. I am, therefore, inclined to think that we should allow them since one of the things that we have been complaining about in this House is that we helped Sudan but other countries are taking advantage. 

MS KIBOIJANA: I wish to supplement the proposal from the Chairperson of Foreign Affairs Committee. The buildings of our missions abroad are in a sorry state, and as a nation, the way we are portrayed outside this country because of our missions is very negative. That is why I stand up to support that construction of a market is not under the mandate of Foreign Affairs. Let us relocate this money for the construction and rehabilitation of our properties abroad. I think this is a suggestion in the right direction.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Hon. Member, supposing we put this money there and get more money to work on our missions, would that be a problem?

MR KIGYAGI: When you have a child and you produce a young one, you will not kill the young one just because you have to sustain an older child. The issue of the position of our people in Juba is very critical. If there were a fire in this House, Madam Chair - your normal entrance is here, but you would go through the back door. So it is necessary now that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is in charge of people in Juba who are trading in very absurd conditions, does something as an issue of emergency. If you see what Kenya has done for their people, then this meagre money should not even be talked about. This is to help our people to trade in an area, which is acceptable. I propose that you put a question while we look for money for these other missions. But let this little money for Juba go there.

MR BYANYIMA: In addition to what hon. Kigyagi has said, today morning the Secretary to the Treasury who I have always been looking for to come here, came and said the money that was allocated for a market is too little to have an impact on any of our embassies. So the best thing is to use that little money for the market that will have an impact on our trade between Uganda and Sudan so that they can look for money for the embassies. The chairperson was in that meeting and he agreed. So why don’t we move? 

MR LOKERIS: I visited Juba and our people there are very many but the way they are trading - the Sudanese have built some kiosks whose rent they increase on a daily basis. If you come today, they tell you a different figure from what they told you the previous day and if you do not pay, they will just push your things out. Our exports had to increase because of Sudan - the market is critical and we need it as soon as possible. 

I am telling you I saw the situation there and this little money which we are saying we should not put in foreign affairs - why not? It is outside the country. This is a mere building, whether it is built by Foreign Affairs, or by Education, there is no problem because we need this money and we must pass this budget like that.

MR RWAMIRAMA: I stand here to speak for many farmers and traders involved in agricultural products who have boosted our economy in this regional trade fetching US $500,000 million. The proposed market in Juba is so strategic that for us to sit here for only this day and fail to pass it would be a disservice to our people in Juba for the next 12 months and this is not fair. The proposal by the chairperson is very unfortunate because if you have a new born child and you do not have food to sustain both of them, you do not kill the new born child. The issue is to look for money. While it is true that the missions abroad are in a sorry state, the answer resides in your proposal, Madam Chairperson, that we should look for money to cater for those but not to compromise our regional trade which is more important to this economy than actually some of those missions which are not bringing anything here. I support the proposal by hon. Ekanya and I also want to use this opportunity to thank him for being very positive and staying behind on the Opposition bench. I thank you very much.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I want to thank you for completing this part of the process. (Applause) The Minister of Finance will now proceed to prepare the Appropriation Bill. But arising from the reports of the committee and the dissatisfaction about some work, I think tomorrow we should start dealing with some of the reports which are outstanding. 

I adjourn the House to 2.00 p.m. tomorrow. But I need to specifically thank hon. Omach for the work he has done. He has been here from day one to the last day. I really want to thank him and I want to thank the Leader of Government Business for facilitating the process. I thank the Opposition, despite some of them not being here today. I want to thank hon. Ekanya and hon. Penytoo for remaining to fulfil their Constitutional obligation. Thank you very much. 

(The House rose at 2.42 p.m. and adjourned until Thursday, 10 September 2009 at 2.00 p.m.)
