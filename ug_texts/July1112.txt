The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you to this sitting this afternoon. I cannot help but notice that the House is very well represented. (Laughter) When I say this, the honourable members know exactly which part of the Chamber I am referring to.

Honourable members, you are requested to empty your pigeonholes to create space for new documents. This is a period for documents, so please clear your pigeonholes so that you can receive more documents and burn more candles.

Honourable members, today is one of those days where we are going to have a long day, where we are going to resolve very important matters, where we are going to deal with those issues that have created some anxiety. Some strong statements have been made in relation to the issues we are going to deal with. So, as usual we call upon the members to stay focused on this matter so that we can, in the end, resolve it in a way that is beneficial to the country. Today, I want to see a strict observance of the rules again, and the rules of the game are defined. Let us just play by them and we will enjoy the debate this afternoon. Thank you.

MR FRED EBIL (UPC, Kole County, Kole): Mr Speaker and honourable members, I rise on a matter of national importance. Yesterday, the 10 July 2012, disaster struck my constituency in the Parish of Adelogo in Alito Sub-county, Kole District. Due to the hailstorm and heavy rains, in all 18 villages all crops were swept away. This included cotton, beans, soyabeans, sunflower and maize, among others. Worse still, 17 houses and huts’ roofs were blown off, that is, three iron roofed houses and then 14 huts. Hence, my voters and my people slept outside, including babies, in the cold and rain. Coupled with this, the risk is grave. The possibility of doing nothing has far reaching consequences as problems like famine and disease can spread. 

I beg the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness - as usual it is always the ministry which has responded to my people and they are so proud of that ministry - to intervene as soon as possible because this is a make or break time in my constituency. I want to plead with them to send food like posho and beans, tarpaulins, mosquito nets urgently especially for the young ones. If possible, it should be as soon as available, but the matter is of an urgent nature. Thank you very, Mr Speaker and honourable members. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, these issues of disaster have become a problem-

2.25
THE MINISTER OF DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND REFUGEES (Dr Stephen Mallinga): Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable Member of Parliament, first of all for appreciating the efforts of the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness and Refugees. Actually, honourable members, when something like that happens, the right thing to do there is to set up what they call a disaster committee in your district, and the chairperson is the CAO. So, what you do, let the CAO write to us as soon as possible. If you can bring the CAO’s letter tomorrow, we shall send a team to verify what has happened and then they come with a recommendation of what intervention we can carry out in your constituency. So, get the CAO to write to us as soon as possible. Thank you very much.

2.26
MS EVELYN ANITE (NRM, Youth, Northern): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker and honourable colleagues. When we were breaking off for recess on 30 May 2012, the last item on the agenda was a comprehensive report that was supposed to be given by the Minister of Finance in relation to the Youth Venture Capital Fund.  What the minister said at that time was that he was not prepared with the statement but the information that he gave us was that 3000 youths had accessed this money. Up to today, we have not seen the comprehensive report and there is something very serious that is going on in the country. 

Given the harsh conditions that were put to access the Youth Venture Capital Fund, the young people worked so hard and registered their companies. They spent their money to open accounts and they met all the minimum requirements to access the money. What is sad is that as we speak, the banks are telling the young people that the money that they had in the bank is finished. 

We expect Government to tell us if truly they dispersed money to these banks and how much money they dispersed to the three banks - Centenary, DFCU and Stanbic. The young people are going there and now they are calling us. Our phones are made busy; they think that we are liars and they are threatening to remove us from our offices just because they want to know if the money is there. They think that we are not working for their interests.

We want to know who the beneficiaries of this money are because we got information from my constituency - I represent 28 districts of Northern Uganda. We do not know which people have exactly benefitted from this money. We expect the government to avail us with the names of those who have benefitted from this money, what enterprises they are doing and in which districts are they located.

If we do not know, Mr Speaker, the old people are using these young people as conduits to go and access this money. Now the old people, because they are doing business, disguise themselves and tell the young person to go and access this money. At the end of the day, the money does not go to the pockets of the young people, it goes to the old people and Government is sitting back and not doing anything about it. It is such a big shame. I want to tell you, categorically - I have seen Government asking for money on the Order Paper. As a young person of 28 years, and representing the young people of Northern Uganda, I can assure you we are going to block this loan request. 

Honourable members of the front bench, I am very happy you are here in big numbers today, but I want to tell you that I am not speaking with my voice; this is coming from the young people in the 112 districts of Uganda. You should be ready for it. Thank you. 

THE MINISTER OF LANDS, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (Mr Daudi Migereko): Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable member, Anite, for the issues she has raised. These are very critical and burning issues. 

Mr Speaker, you had given a directive. The Executive, in particular the Minister of Finance, has been considering this matter. I request that you give permission to the Minister of State for Finance (General Duties) to update us in regard to when the statement on this fund will get here. I had been told that a submission had been made in advance to Parliament and I had hoped that there would be no need to get members to express any form of disgust in regard to the way we are handling this matter. Maybe we allow hon. Omach to tell the House how soon this statement will be here. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, last week I made three directives here, one was on ministerial policy statements, and I see others still pending. The second one was on questions for oral answer, which is causing anxiety among the members. Members do not know the procedure to follow to get any information from the Executive. I directed that all questions which were pending should have been answered last week and the rest this week. Tomorrow is the last day of this week for a parliamentary sitting. The third directive was on ministerial statements, which were pending, and tomorrow is also the last day. 

You will recall that this particular statement has been promised, re-promised and several undertakings have been made. This is affecting all members, not just the members for the youth. I am hoping that the hon. Jacan Omach is coming now to confirm that there is a statement ready for delivery today or tomorrow.  

2.32
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Fred Omach): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker and honourable colleagues. Last week, the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development submitted an information paper on the Youth Venture Capital Fund. We expected it to be on the Order Paper today, but the Clerk’s office could not identify where the papers were. Otherwise, I am ready with my copy - (Laughter) - I can present -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Please finish what you are saying.

MR OMACH: We submitted an information paper on the Youth Venture Capital Fund last week to the Clerk’s office.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Does it pass for a ministerial statement, because that is what we are expecting? I hear a new term - what are you calling it, honourable minister, -(Laughter)- information something?

MR OMACH: It is a ministerial statement - (Laughter) - on the Youth Venture Capital Fund. I have my copy but we will submit that tomorrow. It will be presented here. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can we, at an appropriate time, alter the Order Paper to accommodate this statement, that is if the members are ready to proceed. Are the copies available for members? If the members are prepared to proceed without copies of the statement, we proceed. If you are not prepared to proceed without copies of the statement, then we will receive it tomorrow when there are sufficient copies for all the members. Will that be okay? Let us do it tomorrow, honourable minister. Please, do not let us down on this matter tomorrow again. I think let us not spend more time on this. Let us deal with it tomorrow. 

MR ELIJAH OKUPA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I remember that time there were two statements which the Minister of Finance was supposed to bring.  The other one was about the funding of UPE and USE schools which are partnering with the government, especially the private schools. At that time we presented arrears for a number of schools. Teso alone is to a tune of about Shs 3 billion. The private schools have not received money since 2011. 

When we brought up the matter here, the Minister of Education pushed it to the Ministry of Finance, saying that it is the Ministry of Finance which has not sent the money. So, could the minister tomorrow, as he brings this other statement about the Youth Venture Capital Fund, also bring that statement to affirm and to reassure the owners of the private schools that the money is being processed; otherwise, these schools are going to close before the end of the term.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the issue on questions for oral answer is contained in my directive of last week. We are expecting that before close of business today and tomorrow, we will have received all the pending replies to questions for oral answer and all the statements. That applies specifically to the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Health and the other ministers who have pending statements. 

Rt Hon. Prime Minister, Leader of Government Business, this is the order of the Speaker. Tomorrow we might not be very peaceful if these matters are not brought the way we have requested. Okay, honourable member, do you have another issue? If it is about statements, let us deal with them tomorrow. They know those things.

2.37
BRIG. CHARLES ANGINA (UPDF Representative): Mr Speaker and Members of Parliament, I rise on a matter of national importance. I happen to be one of the members of the Sessional Committee on Foreign Affairs which travelled to China. I am going to focus on one area which I will address pertaining to sexual slavery, which I witnessed and I got an opportunity to interview one of the victims. 

Mr Speaker, when I was in Guangzhou, I met the Deputy Consul-General and one of the staff. The rest were deployed. I also got the opportunity to meet one of these victims. I do not wish to mention her name now until we resolve the way forward. I am concerned because these very young girls are victims because they were misinformed about lucrative jobs and also promised that they were going there to be able to better their lives and yet they are actually luring them into slavery. Because of the fear of the HIV/AIDS scourge, I rise to see that we get a quick solution.

When these girls are leaving this country, they are told that because this is a lucrative business that they are going into and that they will be happy, they should not disclose because the recruiters believe that they will be overwhelmed and they will miss the chance. They were not supposed to notify anybody else, including their relatives. Because of earlier information about the same, these recruiters are now making these young girls leave this country from our neighbouring sister countries of the East African Community.
  
With the aspect of indoctrination, when they arrive in China, for instance where I was, they are straightaway taken to a witchdoctor, and this witchdoctor happens to be a Ugandan lady. She immediately shaves off these girls hair from the forehead, cuts the finger nails and the pubic hair which are kept aside. They put some of them into a pipe with six heads, and this psychologically tortures these young girls with the promise that they will run mad or die if they disclose their mission when they start to operate. These girls are traumatised, and it is very painful.

Mr Speaker, they immediately withdraw their passports and ensure that the passports are kept safely or returned to Uganda awaiting for them to raise US$ 4,000 to US$ 7,000 to redeem their freedom. Honourable Members of Parliament, this is a serious matter that calls upon us as Parliament to see how we can quickly and robustly embark on a solution to this problem. This racket is quite connected because they make sure they change the name of the victim and by the time you get your passport, it is only your picture that identifies you. Where you come from and your names are changed and even when relatives try to trace you using your particulars, they will never trace you.

These are my prayers, Mr Speaker: the first one is that the Ministry of Internal Affairs be advised to stick to the procedure of issuing passports only after interviewing the adult – (Applause) - so that they are able to see whether this is the particular person that the passport is being issued to.

My second prayer is that because these criminals have made a lot of money by exploiting our people, it is my prayer that we make sure that they pay for these tickets to bring back all these Ugandans that are stranded. Some of them are even in prison because of being found transporting drugs and yet these are very innocent children who do not even know prohibited drugs. I was able to realise that most of these young children are crying that they are punished by being thrown out in the cold even during winter to make them succumb to these conditions that they are being put into, and some of them end up being raped under those circumstances. 

Mr Speaker, these are voters that all of us should work very hard to make sure that they come back. (Laughter) They are already at the age of voting for the right thing, but they are being pushed into this slavery. It is also my prayer that the Ministry of Internal Affairs together with the IGP be given conditions to quickly embark on this investigation to have these criminals prosecuted. 

It is also my prayer that we acknowledge the good work of the Consular-General’s Office in Guangzhou for the commendable job they have so far done with their limited resources to repatriate some of these Ugandans back. I pray that we take this as a serious matter of national importance. I pray.

MS ANIFA KAWOOYA: I thank you, Mr Speaker. I also thank my colleague for the statement he has made. On the issue of human trafficking, sexual exploitation and modern slavery, the Committee on Equal Opportunities came to this House and presented a brief on the same issues and its findings after a delegation of members on the committee were sent to Malaysia by the Speaker, hon. Rebecca Kadaga. 

The report on this issue is ready and it is my humble request that where the situation has reached, and with the new evidence, we could be allotted a slot on the Order Paper as a matter of urgency so that we discuss the current findings together with the report by early next week. I thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable chairperson, the procedure is that once a report is ready, you submit a copy to the Clerk’s Office and to the Office of the Speaker so that they are in the know that such a report is ready and it can be brought to the Order Paper. Have you submitted these reports to the Clerk’s Office?

MS KAWOOYA: We did in our last session but when other facts came in, they said that they would put it on the Order Paper but we do not see it.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can we have this matter coming up on Tuesday next week so that we can have a comprehensive discussion.

MR OKUPA: I thank you. Before the team of the equal opportunities committee went out and before this, I had earlier on laid a petition here on the same subject about girls in Iraq who were helped by the Americans to get here. That petition addressed a number of issues and a committee was asked to investigate. By now that committee should have produced a report. Could we ask that committee to speed up such that these issues are all discussed in totality?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Which committee?

MR OKUPA: The Committee on Gender and Social Development headed by hon. Nokrach.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is hon. Nokrach here?

MR OKUPA: We could combine all these because that was also a petition which needs to be addressed.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is there a member of this committee here? We need some information on this. Can I direct that all these matters be put together so that we have a comprehensive debate next Tuesday and we deal with these matters urgently.

MR JOHN KEN-LUKYAMUZI (CP, Rubaga Division South, Kampala): I thank you very much, Mr Speaker. 

In my capacity as Shadow Minister for Water and Environment – (Laughter) - I rise to express concern about a very pertinent issue which occurred along Entebbe Road in my constituency, Rubaga South. The place is Najjanankumbi. Over the weekend at about 5.00 a.m. on Monday, a group from Umeme, dressed in Umeme uniform, summarily cut down trees under the cover of trimming them so that the wires can pass. 

Mr Speaker, this is a very serious matter because we all know that if there is anybody who should value greatly the existence of trees, it should be Umeme. Trees guarantee the existence of the waterfalls from which hydro electricity is generated. In the absence of trees, you cannot guarantee the free flow of water, which runs the turbines for generation of electricity. Because of that important matter, I would like to suggest that Umeme should replace those trees which were cut down. If they do not replace them, we should even consider terminating their tender.

What I am talking about is not only prevalent in Najjanankumbi but I have seen the same along Nakasero Road in Kizungu, Kololo where many ambassadors live, and they have been fighting these people in silence. 

MR ODONGA OTTO: I am just seeking clarification from hon. Ken-Lukyamuzi because what I have seen is that at times when the electricity lines touch the trees when it is raining, they spark and even electrocute people who are under the tree. So the clarification I am seeking is if the cutting they are doing is different from the routine one of just ensuring that electricity lines do not touch the trees which could end up electrocuting people.

MR JOHN KEN-LUKYAMUZI: These people do not prune. They just summarily cut down the tree and it falls on the ground. This is very dangerous to our environment at a time when we are all collectively touched about the phenomenon of climate change. So, my prayers are as follows: 

One, the minister in charge of energy and the minister in charge of the environment should guarantee the safety of the remaining trees, knowing very well that these trees were planted on CHOGM money and the taxpayer has been bearing that.

Secondly, let us consider cancelling the Umeme tender because they have proved to be behaving irresponsibly. What they did is in open breach of the Forest Act, and finally – 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable Lukyamuzi, telephone lines, electricity lines, and water lines have legal provisions called wayleaves. Could this be falling within the wayleaves that is protected by the law or are they outside the wayleaves, so that Parliament can be guided on what you have seen? 

Wayleaves are authority of passage for these things that is granted to the agencies by law to use those corridors for their purposes. Have you verified these things so that the House can be guided? 

MR JOHN KEN-LUKYAMUZI: Mr Speaker, I have verified that. Ordinarily, Umeme would have to trim these trees responsibly without totally destroying them. What they do is total destruction as if they do not live in Uganda. If this is not done in the given time, I intend to persuade my constituents to go on the streets and demonstrate. I would like to lay on the Table the photographs of the tragedy as it occurred in Najjanankumbi. (Laughter)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, who took the photographs?

MR JOHN KEN-LUKYAMUZI: I took the photographs myself.

2.53
THE MINISTER OF ENERGY AND MINERALS (Ms Irene Muloni): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your wise guidance. I want to thank hon. Odonga-Otto for the information that he gave. As a matter of fact, what Umeme does is to clear vegetation which is in the wayleave of where the electricity lines are passing. By law, for the low voltage lines on either side of the line, there should be a minimum distance of 10 metres. For the high voltage lines, it is 15 metres on either side. High voltage is 132 kilovolts. So, where you see those towers, steer clear at least by 15 metres from the high voltage because it is dangerous to human life. 

As hon. Odonga Otto indicated, when it rains and the trees touch the electricity line, because there is voltage and current running through them, it causes short circuits and you will see sparks. If there are any human beings around and they touch the tree, they get electrocuted. So, as a matter of safety, it is extremely important that we observe that clearance so that we can all live in harmony because we need electricity and the law provides for the wayleave. While we want to plant trees, let us plant trees outside the corridor so that we are able to live in harmony. We need electricity and we need trees. Let us observe the law. Thank you, Mr Speaker.  

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the issues are clear; let us not extend this debate. I need the chairperson of the equal opportunities committee; is she still here? I need to know when this particular report that she was talking about was submitted to the Clerk’s office. If it was submitted in the last session of Parliament, then it is okay but if it was submitted in the last Parliament, then there might be issues with it.  It was given to the Clerk’s office so we will still be able to deal with it next week as I directed. 

Honourable members, in the distinguished visitors’ gallery this afternoon we have Dr Opio Oloya, a senior educationist and senior member of the Uganda North America Association, Canada Chapter. Those of you who read the New Vision every week, Dr Opio Oloya has a column. He has come to observe the proceedings of the House this afternoon. Please join me in welcoming Dr Opio Oloya. (Applause)  

In the public gallery this afternoon we have pupils and teachers of Jinja Army Boarding Primary School, which is represented by hon. Moses Balyeku, Member of Parliament Jinja Municipality West. They have come to observe the proceedings. Please join me in welcoming them. (Applause)

2.57
MR KAPS HASSAN FUNGAROO (FDC, Obongi County, Moyo): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Honourable members, on my own behalf and on behalf of the people of Obongi, I rise on a matter of national importance. 

Last Saturday, nine people were attacked with pangas; five of them were seriously injured and were admitted in Moyo Hospital. More attacks of the same nature are feared. The matter is about border disputes between Yumbe and Moyo. This is not the first time that we have raised this matter in the House. In March this year, the same thing occurred and I stood on the Floor and raised this matter. The Speaker directed that the Committee on Physical Infrastructure and the ministries of local government, lands and surveys go and intervene. To my dismay, these actions did not take place and the same thing has occurred. We fear that more and even worse attacks might occur. 

I would like to appeal to you, Mr Speaker and the entire House – this matter needs the attention of the country. Today we are here, but tomorrow we might hear something bad. What shall we say when these are things that can be prevented? Moyo District also has had complaints on international borders between Uganda and the Republic of South Sudan. When there are no quarrels, the Government of Uganda forgets and treats everything normal. 

A petition was even brought by the MP for Moyo West on the issue of the Uganda-South Sudan border. However, I am sorry to tell you, Mr Speaker, that no action has been taken for the people to see the two governments responsibly move towards a resolution of the problem.

Mr Speaker, all ministries, including the Ministry of Defence and Internal Affairs, have ignored this issue. There are things that are happening along the Uganda-Congo border. We, the people of Moyo District, are on the border. If I may recall the speech of H.E General Salva Kiir of the Republic of South Sudan and that of President Museveni when they visited Moyo one time - let me quote what His Excellency said, “We used not to have these problems. Our people lived in harmony. What is happening? Is this really a normal border dispute or there is something cooking under it?”

From that, I would like to say that I am here to help this country, and particularly hon. Dr Stephen Mallinga who said I am the one - You are the Minister of Disaster Preparedness, but here is a disaster coming and you are not prepared. (Laughter) I want to help you prepare. My prayer is that we get express help, Mr Speaker. 

The Minister of Local Government should not just go on creating districts before he sensitizes the occupants about where the boundaries are. If the issue is about boundaries, technology - 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, my rule on this subject is that when you rise to address a matter of urgent public importance, you are presumed to have all the information.

MR FUNGAROO: Okay, Mr Speaker, let me summarise. What I was saying is that much as we need administrative units such as districts, sub counties and so forth, we need to know that the technology for the production of maps is here. Let it be made a point that once a motion is brought here to create a new district, the area to be designated a district should have proper boundaries. The occupants should be told where those boundaries start and end. They must also be taught how to use simple gadgets so that this problem is resolved. Thank you very much.

3.01
MS CHRISTINE ABIA (FDC, Woman Representative, Arua): Mr Speaker, in 2007 there was the Ngorodoto Accord. Uganda is a signatory to it. One of the critical issues in there was that Uganda and the neighbouring countries should deal with the international border issues. The question that arose that time was: what is the problem? Our own ministers were charged with tracing the international border lines that were drawn at the time of Independence and they promised to report to Parliament accordingly. However, up to this time when these borders are being disputed, I am wondering since the year 2007 what has happened.

On the internal district wrangles, Mr Speaker, we know that there are districts that were created out of their mother districts. One of the significant problems that is causing all this is the quest to create more constituencies. In the case of what is happening in the West Nile Region, there is the greed with the access to the waters and the assumption or the reality that there is the presence of hydrocarbons along the Nile Basin. These are some of the problems that we are grappling with. 

The inconsistency in terms of action, when proposals were made here and read for the communities, is the biggest challenge that we have. The question then is, we are having these counter attacks with people from Yumbe going to attack those in Moyo and the others retaliating, and all this is happening in the full presence of Government. What we are asking is: isn’t there no mechanism or administrative mechanism? Isn’t there Government that can help to sort out both internal and external boundary issues? I am asking this because if the year 2007 passed and up to now we are still grappling with this problem, how does anyone justify the presence and existence of Government. That is the critical question we care to ask.

I vividly remember His Excellency directing the then minister to expedite that process as soon as immediately. How soon can immediacy be if it was not 2007?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Can we have a response from the minister. There are issues of the international and district boundaries. Can we hear from the Minister for Local Government on the district borders.

3.04
THE MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr Adolf Mwesige): Mr Speaker, thank you very much. I would like to inform the House that districts are created by Parliament – (Interjections) – Yes, that is the law, and the Constitution is very clear on who creates districts. Anyway, the question of internal borders is not new, as the honourable member said. 

I would like to inform the House that we have a team in the Ministry of Lands that is working on demarcation of internal boundaries where there are conflicts. I had not checked with those officials before coming here because I had not anticipated this question. So, I would like to request you, Mr Speaker, to give me time to liaise with my colleagues at the Ministry of Lands so that we can come back here tomorrow with a more researched and comprehensive answer.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: You can come tomorrow? Okay. That is okay.

MS ABIA: Mr Speaker, I am not usually the character that puts people to order here but before a district is created, the presumption is that you bring all the necessary information including the boundaries. So, are you in order to suggest that as the minister in charge, you do not know the boundaries of your own districts that you created?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, ordinarily district boundaries should never be an issue because all the people know them, they are created from the existing counties and sub counties. The issue that is before the House is not whether districts have boundaries or not. The issue is that there are contested boundaries by the people, which is causing conflicts. So, the honourable minister is perfectly in order to report on those specific cases where conflicts have arisen because we do not have district boundary conflicts all over the country; they are only in specific areas.

That was on the district boundaries. What about the international borders? Do we have anybody to say something? 

3.07
THE THIRD DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND DEPUTY LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Lt Gen.(Rtd) Moses Ali: It is common knowledge that foreign affairs liaises with the neighbouring countries to bring these conflicts to an end using an amicable solution. I am sure that this issue will be resolved. This applies to all borders and not only to a few of them. As a country, you know that we are right in the centre bordered by six or so countries. So, the issue is being attended to. Thank you, Sir.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next week we have urgent business to deal with. Can I ask for a statement on this matter because it has been here many times. There have been issues on international borders with the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of South Sudan, Kenya – Migingo - and all these other things; can we ask for a good statement to be made next week on Wednesday. It is so ordered. We need a comprehensive statement on this next week on Wednesday so that members can be abreast with the goings on in the government. 

PRESENTATION OF PAPERS

I) MINISTERIAL POLICY STATEMENT FOR THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND SPORTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2012/2013

3.09
THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND SPORTS (Ms Jessica Alupo): Mr Speaker and members, in accordance with section 6(2) of the Budget Act 2001, I have the honour to present to the Ninth Parliament of Uganda the policy statement of the Ministry of Education and Sports for the financial year 2012/2013. I beg to lay.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: We will also need to extract an apology from you immediately for not complying with the Speaker’s order last week. You need to apologise to the House. 

MS ALUPO: Mr Speaker, I apologise for not complying with your directives to have made this statement and presented it by last week. Thank you. 

II) MINISTERIAL POLICY STATEMENT FOR THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2012/2013.

3.10
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Fred Ruhindi): Mr Speaker, I beg to lay on the Table the ministerial policy statement for the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs and allied institutions for the financial year 2012/2013, and with all humility my apologies should be recorded for – (Laughter) - the delay. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let the records capture those two ministerial policy statements. A clear exception for the next one because the Chair was constantly briefed about the progress of the statement from this particular institution, so there is no apology required. 

III) MINISTERIAL POLICY STATEMENT FOR THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSION FOR THE FINACIAL YEAR 2012/2013

3.11
MS JALIA BINTU (NRM, Woman Representative, Masindi): Thank you, Mr Speaker and honourable members. I beg to lay on the Table the policy statement for the Parliamentary Commission for the financial year 2012/2013.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let the records capture that. Thank you very much. We have now concluded with all the policy statements. Ordinarily, this process should have been terminated by the 30th of last month. Today is the 11th of July and we are 11 days into the time the committees should have been processing these things. So, the committees are urged to act accordingly. 

I do not want what happened last year to happen this year. Last year, I was forced to extend three times before we could conclude with the budget process. The deadline is 31st August and we need to start this debate on the ministerial policy statements and the reports of the committees at least for 15 days because there are so many committees that have to be considered. 

Remember that we also had to shorten the time given to the chairpersons because we had to accommodate all the reports within the timeframe provided for by the Act. I do not wish to extend even once this year. So, committee chairpersons, you are on notice that these matters should be comprehensively handled and completed 15 days before 31st August, and that means by 15th August we should have all the reports ready. I am clear on this. Let us agree and work round the clock to deal with these matters. 

IV) SUPPORT TO THE UGANDA PANEL SURVEY PROJECT – WAVE 1 – UGANDA BUREAU OF STATISTICS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2011

QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER

QUESTION 20/1/09 TO THE MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT

3.27
MS JESSICA ABABIKU (NRM, Woman representative Adjumani): Would the Minister inform the House when the elections for LCI and LC II are to be conducted?

3.29
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr Alex Onzima): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have a very strong conviction that honesty breeds trust either between individuals or collectively between institutions. Whoever trusts finally prevails; lasting harmony becomes entrenched in the working relations between either individuals or institutions, and in our case the Legislature and the Executive arms of Government. 

Accordingly, I do tender in a very strong and honest response to the question raised by the hon. Ababiku, Woman Representative, Adjumani, as to when the village and parish local council elections will be conducted as follows:

Mr Speaker and honourable members, it is very true that ever since the year 2002, elections of the village and parish councils have not been conducted largely due to the very high costs, which the Electoral Commission had budgeted at Shs 150 billion. According to my permanent secretary, when the officials in the Ministry of Local Government and the Electoral Commission re-evaluated the figure of Shs 150 billion, they managed to secure a reduction of Shs 20 billion without amending the Local Government Act. However, due to other pressing priorities to the Government of the Republic of Uganda, the now Shs 130 billion is not readily available. 

In a top management meeting of the Ministry of Local Government on Monday, 13 February 2012 it was resolved that the cost of the much desired elections will be drastically reduced by effecting amendments to the local government electoral laws. Consequently, my ministry drafted the necessary amendment proposals. 

On 13 March 2012, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Local Government, in a letter referenced "ADM/121/01" addressed to the Solicitor-General, sought authority from the First Parliamentary Council to draft a Local Government (Amendment) Bill, 2012 without further prior reference to Cabinet. On Saturday, 26 March 2012 the Attorney-General, the hon. Peter Nyombi, responded in a letter referenced FPC/17/142/01 addressed to the Deputy Secretary to Cabinet authorising the waiver as requested by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Local Government. 

In our 14th Cabinet meeting of Wednesday, 11 April 2012, the Minister of Local Government, hon. Adolf Mwesige, tabled before Cabinet the proposed Local Government (Amendment) Bill, which Cabinet overwhelmingly approved. 

Accordingly, Cabinet directed the Minister of Local Government to expeditiously liaise with the Attorney-General, the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development as well as the Electoral Commission to ensure that implementation of village and parish local council elections is achieved sooner than later. 

On Thursday, 3 May 2012, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Local Government in a letter referenced ADM/120/01 addressed to the Solicitor General, requested him to gazette the Local Government (Amendment) Bill, 2012. The Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, the hon. Maria Kiwanuka, on Friday, 30 March 2012, issued my ministry with a Certificate of Financial Implication and pledged to allocate an additional Shs 30 billion towards the elections in the 2012/2013 fiscal year. The Electoral Commission has already secured Shs 19 billion out of the 2011/2012 fiscal year for conducting the said elections making a total of the required estimated amount of Shs 49 billion. 

In my earlier text of the answer to the oral question of Tuesday, 15 May 2012, I did indicate that the Local Government (Amendment) Bill, 2012 will soon be tabled in Parliament for first reading. It is now my pleasure to state authoritatively   that on Tuesday, 3 July 2012 the Minister of Local Government, the hon. Adolf Mwesige, tabled the Local Government (Amendment) Bill, 2012 for first reading and the Bill is now before the Sessional Committee on Public Service and Local Government for scrutiny. It is estimated that these amendments will grossly reduce the cost of local council elections by Shs 83 billion. 

It is now our prayer, as the Executive arm of Government of the Republic of Uganda, that the Legislature as another arm of the same Government will promptly appropriate the necessary funds to enable the Electoral Commission conduct the village and parish local council elections before 31 December, 2012. The Ministry of Local Government and indeed the Executive arm of Government are very optimistic that the vibrant and equally focused honourable members of the Ninth Parliament on either side of the august House will promptly and overwhelmingly endorse the said amendments to pave way for the much awaited exercise of conducting the crucial village and parish local council elections. 

The Government of the Republic of Uganda very strongly anticipates that with this Local Government (Amendment) Bill urgently translated into an Act promptly, the Electoral Commission will have conducted village and parish local council elections before 31 December, 2012. 

Mr Speaker and honourable members, I wholeheartedly thank you for your kind attention. For God and our Mother Country, the Republic of Uganda.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable  member, any supplementary questions? 

MS ABABIKU: Thank you, Rt Hon. Speaker and the august House. I would like to thank the minister for his response. However, I have more issues for clarification. The minister acknowledged that for 10 years, elections for these structures have not been held due to other pressing priorities of the government. I strongly believe that –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Please, ask the supplementary question. 

MS ABABIKU: Thank you. What are the pressing Government priorities other than having these elections held? 

Two, on the ground, many people are standing in to fill in the gaps and are being paid Shs 10,000 per month, which has made many of them abandon those roles and responsibilities. What is the ministry doing in order to ensure that there is perfection at the local council level, specifically where the LC I and LC II structures are? 

Three, the minister stated that the Shs 130 billion is still not available and yet he is promising that before 31 December, 2012 there is hope that these elections will be held. I would like assurance on that.

Fourthly, the minister stated that the Minister of Finance has promised Shs 30 billion additional funding. Based on his cries that even the Shs 130 billion is not enough, what is the specific estimate he can give to this House so that we can believe that the elections can take place before 31 December, 2012?  Thank you very much.  

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much.  Is it a supplementary question as well? 

MS BAKO ABIA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question to the minister is that 10 years ago, the economy of this country was doing a lot better that it is doing right now and it has been “other pressing priorities”; do you really think that if these amendments came to this House tomorrow and they were passed, you would get that commitment from Ministry of Finance and get this money to ensure that these elections are carried out this year? Ten 10 years and now the economy is worse –(Member timed out.)

3.39
MR SSEMUJJU NGANDA (FDC, Kyadondo County East, Wakiso): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In most villages, there is some sort of LCI structure. What is the status of those structures and the people who are holding offices as LCI and LCII chairpersons and committees?

3.39
DRCHRIS BARYOMUNSI (NRM, Kinkiizi County East, Kanungu): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I thank the minister for his response although it should have been more precise. I have just one additional question. Recently, the Ministry of Local Government was organising elections in the new administrative units like the town councils which we created, and also in lower local governments where councillors had died and where there were vacant positions. The date had initially been fixed for 12th July and it was postponed to 16th August and then postponed indefinitely at the last hour. 

I just want to get a clarification from the honourable minister whether his ministry intends to merge those elections with these of the LCI and LCII or a separate date is being organised. In which case, which date are you going to announce when these elections will take place?

3.40
MS BETTY AOL (FDC, Woman Representative, Gulu): Thank you, honourable minister. The Minister of State for Local Government highlighted on the important issues, especially priorities. However, all of us know that LCIIs have a very important role to play on land. I want to get a clarification from the honourable minister about the reason for undermining the local councils and yet there are many issues at the grassroots being handled by LC IIs right now. Are they still legal or the LCIIs are already illegal, considering that their time expired a long time ago?

3.42
MR AZA ALERO (NRM, West Moyo County, Moyo): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Minister for Local Government, now that so many districts have been created, are those also going to be considered for LCI elections? Thank you very much.

3.42
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr Alex Onzima): I thank the honourable members who have raised supplementary questions to the one raised by the hon. Ababiku. Allow me to respond as follows: 

The issue at hand is no longer the Shs 130 billion previously requested by the Electoral Commission. We should, I think, appreciate that all these proposed amendments are now before this august House, and as I stated earlier on, we anticipate that the cost of conducting these elections will be drastically reduced. We are now talking of approximately Shs50 billion. The Shs19 billion has already been secured and it is in the hands of the Electoral Commission. The Ministry of Finance has strongly pledged that the Shs 30 billion is contained in the 2012/2013 fiscal year. This money will be appropriated by this same House, we the Members of Parliament. 

The logical thing for us to do as Parliament is to scrutinise the amendments as provided and then appropriate the additional Shs30 billion that the Ministry of Finance has accommodated in the budget. It is only after this that Parliament can come back, maybe by the end of the year, and say, “what happened, because you had Shs 19 billion secured already and Ministry of Finance said Shs 30 billion would also be secured this fiscal year.” It will only be that time, at the end of the year, that Parliament can come back and say, “This was your promise, what has happened?”

So please, let me request Parliament to be patient and we go through this process, which is currently in your hands. Play your part and leave the rest to the Electoral Commission and the Executive arm of Government to see whether this promise will be fulfilled. As for the elections that have been halted a bit, our position as Ministry of Local Government is that in October these elections will be conducted. I thank you.

MR KEN-LUKYAMUZI:  Mr Speaker, I was reluctant to interrupt the honourable minister but upon consulting the contents of Article 1(4) of our Constitution, I realised that I wish he had not said anything because he was trying to defend a nullity in law. I beg to read Article 1(4):”The people shall express their will and consent on who shall govern them and how they should be governed, through regular, free and fair elections of their representatives or through referenda.”

Knowing that the institutions we are referring to, namely the village LCIs, the Constitutional Court ruled they do not exist in law, is it in order for the honourable minister to continue defending a nullity in constitutional law?        

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: What the Speaker has heard from the minister is that the elections to fill those offices which have been declared vacant will be conducted in October. That is what the Speaker heard. The point of order does not arise. (Laughter) Honourable minister, have you finished? 

MR SSEMUJJU NGANDA: Mr Speaker, I asked a supplementary question as regards to the status of the individuals now occupying those offices for which the minister has been labouring an answer and has creatively avoided-

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Those offices were declared empty by the court. What do you want the minister to say, that there are people in them?

MR SSEMUJJU NGANDA: I am asking Government because these individuals in various villages are acting as if they are-

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Please, honourable members, this is not a matter that will attract debate. There is a Bill before the House. Let us wait and handle that Bill and move forward.

MR ONZIMA: Well, my answer here is that if any Ugandan is not satisfied by some leaders occupying offices illegally, they can only get redress in courts of law not from the Minister of Local Government. That is my humble answer.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: But to the best of your knowledge, honourable minister, are there people occupying these offices illegally? That is the question? 

MR ONZIMA: Mr Speaker, as far as I am concerned many people from my constituency have been getting services from the LCs. Right now, for instance, how many of you have acquired passports for the first time and what process do you go through?

MR SSEMUJJU NGANDA: Mr Speaker, in my constituency the LCIIIs are still passing on 20 percent of money collected from villages to these structures. I am really shocked that a whole Minister of Local Government does not care that LCIIIs are passing on public resources to structures that are non-existent in law. Is he, therefore, in order to suggest that if any Ugandan is aggrieved by the structures that are supposed to be supervised by him, they should go to court instead of seeking an answer from him?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable minister, would you like to state for the record what you actually said?

THEDEPUTY ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr Fredrick Ruhindi): Mr Speaker, can I be protected from hon. Christine Abia and from being termed as a chief liar. (Laughter)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: That is not parliamentary.

MR RUHINDI: Mr Speaker, the issues raised by hon. Ssemujju are very important and we need to address them rationally. If we may cast our minds back to the case of Rubaramira Ruranga, we were on the verge of elections at every level if you may recall at that time. The Constitutional Court ruled that, “Halt these elections and ensure that the law is amended to suit a multiparty dispensation.” They did not nullify office bearers holding those offices. They did not. They only said, “Go and amend the law to suit a multiparty dispensation”, and that is what we have been grappling with. 

The only thing I wish to say-(Ms Alaso rose_)-Before you come in with clarification, let me state this; maybe this may help you further. This is a matter over which I can consult my colleague, the Minister of Local Government, so that when we come to debate the Bill, we may wish to consider that matter in serious detail. Maybe we could even put in a transitional provision to save us from the situation that has taken place, so that we do not actually affect anything that has been done in this recent past. Thank you.

MR SSEMUJJU NGANDA: Mr Speaker-

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: You rose on a point of order on which I have not yet ruled.

MR SSEMUJJU NGANDA: Yes, the LCIIIs are collecting money and passing over 20 percent to some individuals. What is the remedy?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, what I have heard and I presume all of us have heard is that the Constitutional Court stopped the process of carrying out elections for the local councils at those levels. The Constitutional Court did not nullify the existence neither did they tell the people who are in those offices to stop holding those offices. I am recasting what the Attorney-General said. In effect, the people occupying those offices have continued to occupy them because they have not been stopped by law or by court from occupying them. The only time that they would have ceased to hold those offices were if elections were held, which elections were stopped by the Constitutional Court. That is the situation that has been represented.

MR SABITI: Mr Speaker, these two structures are elective structures and there is a clearly stated period for occupying those offices, and the period expired. It is like Parliament. Can you come and sit in this Parliament when you have not been elected to be in this Parliament? So, the issues we would like the honourable minister to explain are: why are these people in offices? Why is the money from LCIIIs being passed on to people who are not officially or legally occupying those offices?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can I ask the ministers to consult on this matter and report to the House in better detail on Tuesday next week. This matter is closed. Let them report on this on Tuesday and then we can have a debate on it.

Before we go to the next item, you will recall that on 16th May we had a matter that was raised here by hon. Jacinto Ogwal, the MP for Otuke, and the next day the honourable Woman Member made a statement of personal explanation. Arising from the tensions that were generated by the exchanges, I directed that the committee in charge of physical infrastructure should visit this place and come back to the House and advise us on how to move with this matter. 

Last week, I received information from the leadership of the district that Members of Parliament of this House intend to travel there on the 14th. These are not the members of the committee that this House had tasked to find out information about on this matter and come back to the House and brief us. The members that are supposed to go there are members of the Lango Parliamentary Group, which is not entirely a committee of this House. 

Honourable members, this matter had already been brought to this House. Can we respect the ruling and directive of the Speaker that the committee of this House should look into this matter and come back to this House so that we can take appropriate action? Would it not be irregular for another team of this House to go there and have meetings there? 

We do not know what will happen. Wouldn’t it be fair for the members to respect the ruling of the Chair so that we have harmony in the way we handle business that comes before the House? I am, therefore, urging members of Parliament to respect the status quo as directed by the Chair so that we can have a proper way of handling this matter as Parliament. 

I received a letter on 6July 2012 and if its contents are true, I urge members to respect the ruling of the Speaker so that we can have this matter more comprehensively dealt with, other than in a manner which might bring confrontations and other things which might happen due to not following the directive of the Chair. That is the statement from the chair on this matter.

MR BADDA: Mr Speaker, last week on Wednesday, you instructed the Minister of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries who in turn made an assurance that today, he would come with a comprehensive answer arising from the question for oral answer which was raised in relation to the fisheries fund, the licences and related issues. Wouldn’t it be procedurally right for the minister or the Leader of Government Business to give that answer as per the assurance made? 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Usually, we put matters on the Order Paper for which we have received advance copies of statements. It is not on the Order Paper because we did not receive such information. Leader of Government Business, could you handle this matter. What is the situation regarding this directive which came last week on the issue of fisheries? The minister said there would be a response today. 

4.01
THE THIRD DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND DEPUTY LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Lt Gen.(Rtd) Moses Ali): Mr Speaker, this morning we were in Cabinet and the minister was reminded. He said the statement was ready. I do not know why he has not come with it. So, I have to follow it up.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Tomorrow at 2 o’clock we want this statement.

4.01
MS BETTY AMONGI (UPC, Oyam County South, Oyam): Mr Speaker, you raised the matter of Lango Parliamentary Group. I am the vice-chairperson of the Lango Parliamentary Group and the chairperson is hon. Felix Okot-Ogong. The matter where Lango Parliamentary Group is going is an agreed position which emanated from a meeting which occurred between Lango Parliamentary Group, the district chairperson and a representative of the people. It is the district chairperson who gave the date. 

We agreed in a meeting because the matter in Lango is causing confusion. As leaders in Lango, we want to go and calm the people. We had an agreement with the district where the district council informed us, through the chairperson, that the district council had resolved that that piece of land be the district stock farm. Therefore, for us, as Lango Parliamentary Group, we said we would go with what the district says. 

However, the confusion caused in the district, which the chairman informed the committee of, was around a written letter. As leaders of Lango, we agreed to go on Friday 13th, meet the district council to inform us about their resolution together with the Members of Parliament and we go together to the field. It is a joint programme which is being coordinated by the chairman of the district and the Lango Parliamentary Group. 

Secondly, as Lango Parliamentary Group, we raised the matter that as Members of Parliament from there, we cannot see colleagues fighting on the Floor when we have a leadership of Lango Parliamentary Group and we do not guide. You guided that we should appear before the Committee on Physical Infrastructure. Therefore, we agreed that we cannot appear before the Committee on Physical Infrastructure without information. If we are going to appear before the committee, we need to hear from the people, we need to know what is on the ground, we need to agree with the district council and then appear before the committee. 

So, it is not in any way an imposition of Lango Parliamentary Group. It is a programme being done together with the district. Actually, I am perplexed that you are referring to a letter from the district when yesterday the chairman of the district called me and asked me how many people he should prepare a meal for. I am getting shocked.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, you should have had the courtesy to come to the Speaker’s Office and found out the details. In my hands, I am holding a letter dated 5 July 2012 received in my office on 6 July 2012 addressed to the Rt Hon. Speaker of Parliament. The reference is, “Further guidance and clarity on the controversial land at Atira Parish, Angaro Village in Olilim Sub-county, Otuke District.” 

These are the subjects I have raised. I said they should be handled in such a way that we do not create controversy on a matter which Parliament has already taken a position on. That is my guidance. If it is in line with what the House wants, it is okay. However, if it is controversial, the way the tone of this letter is, then it should be handled in that way. 

So, you might benefit by coming to pick a copy of this letter, honourable member, and see if these issues are clear on these things, if you are on all fours with the concerns raised in this letter. Come and pick a copy of this letter and see how you can harmonise it and we proceed properly. That is the prayer of the Speaker. (Members rose_) On this matter? No, please. There will be no debate on this matter. 

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL ECONOMY ON A REQUEST BY GOVERNMENT TO AMEND A RESOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT AUTHORISING GOVERNMENT TO BORROW ISLAMIC DINAR 7.0MILLION (EQUIVALENT TO US $10M) FROM THE ISLAMIC DEVELOPMENTBANK (ISDB), FOR CO-FINANCING THE COMMUNITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMME - PROJECT 3 - CAIIP III

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Chairperson, is this is an amendment to the initial resolution? Please proceed.

4.06
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL ECONOMY (Mr Stephen Mukitale): Mr Speaker and honourable colleagues, I would like to clarify from the onset, as the Speaker has rightly put it, that this is not a new loan request. This is an amendment of a loan request we passed earlier. It is the figures which are changing, from the US$ 10 million initially requested to the US$8 million now available, because of the global challenges within the international banking system.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is it a reduction?
MR MUKITALE: It is a reduction. Mr Speaker and honourable colleagues, on 2 November 2011 this august House resolved to authorise Government to borrow 7 million Islamic dinars equivalent to US$10 million from the Islamic Development Bank for the financing of the Community Agriculture Infrastructure Improvement Programme (CAIIP III). For ease of reference on this matter, I hereby attach a copy of the resolution of Parliament, duly signed by the Clerk to Parliament.

Members will recall that on Thursday, 26 June 2012 the honourable Minister of Finance requested Parliament to consider an amendment to its resolution passed last year. This was two weeks ago. The committee met the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development who submitted that due to competing demand for resources from the Islamic Development Bank by member countries and the current eurozone crisis affecting financial markets, the highest the ISDB can provide is 5,210,0000 Islamic dinars instead of 7,000,000, which is equivalent to US$8 million instead of the US$ 10 million. 

The committee had a meeting with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Local Government and we were informed that Government had since revised the loan amount from the US$10 million to US$8 million, representing a 20 percent reduction accordingly. The physical target for the community access roads has been revised from the original 3,740 to 6,000 – (Interjections) - Sorry, there is a mistake here. The actual effect is that for every sub county with a road, it is going to be reduced by two kilometres. If you had 34 kilometres, you will now get 32. If you had 22 kilometres, you will get 20. That is the correction that was amended. The minister will be able to explain.

The committee, therefore, recommends to this House aware that the CAIIP is very popular and it would have been required in every sub county but due to limited resources, it is rolling out in a few sub counties. The committee therefore recommends that the House approves the request by Government to amend its resolution and authorise Government to borrow Islamic dinars 5.21 million instead of the 7 million Islamic dinars which was initially requested for from the ISDB to support the implementation of phase III of the Community Agricultural Infrastructure Improvement Programme.

We have also attached, after the signatures of the committee members, the original Parliament resolution that had been approved for the original figure of the Islamic dinars 7 million that was equivalent to US$ 10 million. 

To bring members on board, the original report that we passed here on 2 November 2011 was a co-financing of US$10 million from ISDB plus another US$ 60 million that was coming from the African Development Bank. I thought that it is important that we clarify this because it is a reduction and an amendment. The project was already designed but it is now halted because of this deduction of US$2 million. Possibly, the Minister for Local Government, the end-user, can clarify further. I thank you so much.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the question before the House is that Parliament by a resolution amends its resolution of 2 November 2011 to the effect that the initial resolution that carried a figure of US$10 million be amended to now read US$8 million. Is that correct? That is the motion before the House for an amendment of the parliamentary resolution of 2 November 2011, which passed the borrowing of US$10 million. The motion is that that resolution be amended to read US$8 million.

Is there any debate? We will limit this because this is a clear debate and the circumstances have been explained. We cannot do much because they are reducing it based on the circumstances that have changed. The Speaker is still speaking, by the way –(Laughter)- for the benefit of the honourable members so that we do not put too much energy into this because I think it is clear. The circumstances are clear as to why these changes are being made. If it was for increasing, then we would have seen how to debate. You have two minutes. 

4.14
MR YAHAYA GUDOI (NRM, Bungokho County North, Mbale): I thank you, Mr Speaker and colleagues. This goes to my beloved chairperson of the Committee on National Economy. In paragraph 2, I am seeing 26 November 2012 which we have not yet got to. I do not know why, but you will clarify on that because I can see 26 November 2012.

When you go down to paragraph 4, I have read that you have revised downwards from US$10 to US$8 million but I am bogged down by the revised kilometres from 3,740 to 6,600 kilometres and yet the money was revised downwards. Can you throw light on those figures? I thank you.

4.15
MS ANGELLINE OSEGGE (FDC, Woman Representative, Soroti): I thank you, Mr Speaker. While we are kind of glad that the loan amount has come down, it raises a question; I begin to wonder whether we planned for this money. Did we have a projection as to what it was going to do? It looks like we just borrow money sometimes without a purpose and so it ends up getting wasted. How do we decide on how much to borrow and then all of a sudden reduce it if we have plans or activities that are set; can the minister explain this?

4.16
MS SANTA ALUM (UPC, Woman Representative, Oyam): I thank you. I stand to support the motion because this is a project that has already reached the beneficiary communities and they are very excited. We all know the importance of roads; they are key to all development, be it health, education, agriculture or for marketing our produce. 

So as a government – we have been told that we are soon receiving the road equipment for working on our roads - my suggestion is that we continue with this project and for the two kilometres remaining, the Government should try to look for money to complete them. Alternatively, since we are very soon going to get our own district equipment, let the district take this thing over and cater for the two kilometres. We need a commitment. I thank you, and the project should go on.

4.17
MS SARAH KAYAGI (NRM, Woman Representative, Manafwa): I thank you. I want to support the committee and also say that we do not need to waste any more time, we should pass this motion. The Community Agricultural Infrastructure Improvement Programme is one of the programmes that are really helping us and it has been very successful. We have no choice since we have gone to borrow. If I have said that I want 10,000 and the owner says that I am giving you 5,000, I have to accept because I am in need. Let us accept and get this money to do the work but we can borrow more if we are not done. I thank you.

4.18
MR HENRY MUSASIZI (NRM, Rubanda County East, Kabale): I thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Whereas I support the idea of adjusting the loan request, I want to appeal to members to take the initiative of following up how this CAIIP project is being managed at district level. 

The CAIIP III is going to be implemented in my district, Kabale. I would like to inform the House that I have already asked the intervention of the honourable Minister of Local Government, and I am glad that she is helping me very much on how this project is being implemented at district level. The district leadership is tending to own this project to the extent of deciding the sub counties where this project is going to be implemented without a council resolution and not taking into account the criteria that should be followed. 

Honourable members, it is important that when we pass these loan requests and send these monies to the districts, we follow up to ensure that this money does the intended purpose and also helps us as Members of Parliament to deliver to our people. I thank you very much.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the rules require us to stick to the issue under debate. Let me frame the issue under debate again; it is about the reduction of the money. At the beginning of the proceedings, the reasons for the reduction were stated - currency variation and things like that. 

Let me further guide that the borrowing was based on Islamic money and there have been currency variations that have contributed to this. So, the reduction has been made to the equivalent of - The initial borrowing is not in dollars but Islamic dinars. They reduced the dinars, so the implication is the same. That is the debate we are engaged in and not how it is going or where it is going to be utilised. If you are going to ask a question as to why it was reduced, that would be the nature of the debate. 

4.22
MS JANEPHER EGUNYU (NRM, Woman Representative, Buvuma): Thank you so much. Mr Speaker, I find a problem with the CAIIP project which has been in my constituency. It was passed when we were still part of Mukono District before Buvuma broke off. This is CAIIP III but there was CAIIP II and also CAIIP I. In phase two, Buvuma got a chance to get roads in some sub counties. Yes, we appreciate that roads have been opened up, but there are some things like the ice plant. The Minister for Local Government may be aware of the ice plants which were attached to the roads. Where did they go? How can I approve the loan in CAIIP III yet I have not seen CAIIP II successful? Let me first of all get an explanation from the minister. Where did those promises that were attached to the monies in CAIIP II go, for example the ice plant which was supposed to go to Buvuma Island?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, this resolution was passed by this House on 2 November 2011. This particular resolution is to recognise the reduction so that our resolution does not hang on something we cannot get. The resolution was about a particular amount. We passed it on 2 November 2011 but circumstances have changed and we cannot borrow that much from these people. Now we need to amend our resolutions to conform to what we can borrow, which is less than what we had passed. That is what is before the House this afternoon. 

4.24
MR FRED BADDA (NRM, Bujumba County, Kalangala): Mr Speaker, I am moving a motion. Since we already passed this loan request and all the members who have contributed are in support of the amendment, I move a motion that the question be put. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, before I put the question, I am going to reserve my ruling on whether the question should be put or not because I have the discretion to do that. I am going to sample two contributions. If they get outside what the debate is about, I will put the question. I will have the Leader of the Opposition and then the minister.

4.25
THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Mr Nathan Nandala-Mafabi): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The initial resolution was for 7 million dinars, which was equal to almost US$10 million. Now we are borrowing 5.2 dinars, which I think is very little. Now, there is a problem; first, we negotiated for US$10 million and now we are getting less. Does it now mean the lender has seen that Uganda has become a problem that they cannot give the money they had agreed to? This is just a clear indicator. You go to the bank, you have agreed on a certain amount of money, you sign the contract, you are now going to spend and at the time of implementation the banker says, “You are not a bankable person and so instead of two million I will give you half a million.”

Is this the reason –(Interjections)- No, it is not politicising. This is a clear indicator that the world is seeing Uganda in a different context because earlier on they had honoured it but now they cannot honour it. We must reassess ourselves. The money we are talking about is not too much; US$ 10 million is not a big problem to the Islamic Bank. Why should they turn around? You must come and tell us the reason why the bank changed their mind on short notice. 

By the way, we passed the resolution on 2 November 2011 and it is barely six months and they are saying they cannot give you the money. All this and yet we had gone to districts, for example, Buvuma and issued contracts saying we are going to get US$10 million. So, what are we going to do with the contracts we issued? 

Colleagues, whenever you are going to borrow money, there is what we call a project implementation plan. There is a feasibility study and then a project implementation plan is made. It is on that basis that we implement. When you have done a feasibility study, you must compute and confirm whether the net present value is positive. By reducing this money, is the committee telling us that the net present value is still positive? It might be negative. It might not be worth it for us to borrow. So, we need our committees to be serious. You should have gone back and done a reassessment. Are we still on plan?

In my thinking, the world is looking at Uganda as a very bad country and that is the reason they cannot give us the money they had agreed to. We need to quickly assess ourselves on the way forward. I would only agree to the passing of this loan request if the committee could tell us that they have done a feasibility study and that the figures they have confirm that the project is viable. Failure to do that, I think we can get Shs 10 billion from our budget to fund that project. I thank you.

MS ANITE: Mr Speaker, at the beginning of this sitting, I rose up on an issue of national importance in which I mentioned that because of the Youth Venture Capital Fund, when we come to this item I would strongly object to the borrowing of the money. However, having looked at the report, I have realised that actually these lodge units will benefit the young people in this country. The Hansard has already captured what I said in the first case, but also I have just realised that the loan amount has been reduced. So, I am seeking your guidance on whether I can take this opportunity to withdraw my earlier statement. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, we have a parliamentary resolution on this subject. Honourable member, would you like to resume your seat? You know that we have a parliamentary resolution authorising the Government of Uganda to borrow 7 million Islamic dinars. That resolution was passed by this House last year on 2ndNovember. Now Government has come back to say that actually, we cannot get that much from these people; we can only get 5.5 million dinars. So, in the case that we do not have a resolution that is beyond what we can get from these people, we are now moving to conform to the new situation that we can only borrow 5.5 million Islamic dinars. That is the issue at hand now.

MR SABITI: Mr Speaker, I am questioning neither the reduction nor any increases. The guidance I am seeking from you is whether this money is now available so that we pass this resolution when we are sure it is there. Is it now in the Treasury and if so, isn’t it going to affect its operations if we pass this resolution?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, it cannot be in our Treasury because we are just going to borrow it.

MR SABITI: No, we already borrowed and I am sure it is already here. They could have received less –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Minister, have we already received this money or not? Please guide us. This matter should be concluded.

MR OMACH: Mr Speaker, the Islamic Bank was willing to lend us only up to the equivalent of US$10 million. However, due to pressure from other countries that also want to borrow from them, they now can only afford to lend us the equivalent of US$8million, which is available with them. However, they can only give us this money after we have amended our resolution. If we stick to the old resolution, we will not get anything. Under this CAIIP III, we also have US$60 million from the African Development Bank, which is not the issue in question now. So, my appeal to the House is that it passes this motion so that Uganda can get this money. 

MR MWESIGE: Mr Speaker, just one addition. The Minister of Finance has given the reasons why this loan has been adjusted. I also would like to inform the members that following your approval of the loan on the US$60 million from the African Development Bank and the US$10 million from the Islamic Development Bank, the ministry, working with the district councils, selected 68 sub counties from 31 districts. Under the road component, this project is supposed to cover 45 kilometres of gravel road in each sub county. But now with this adjustment, the number of kilometres will reduce from 45 to 43 in each sub county. That is the variation that is going to happen in actual terms.

MS ALASO: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I fully appreciate the reduction in kilometres and that is not what I am looking for. What I am looking for is, when this House approves a loan you set to us the terms and conditions pertaining to it. You tell us the amount of commitment fee, the loan repayment period, the interest and many other such things. 

Given that position, I would like to know from the committee, when it comes to that level, besides losing out kilometres what else has happened in terms of the conditions I have stated above? That is where my interest lies. Has the commitment fee come down, for example? Will he also help me know whether the loan repayment period – I do not know how many years they were; whether 30 or 40 years – has also come down to say 15 years with this reduction? Those are the areas I am concerned with.

MR OMACH: Mr Speaker and honourable members, the terms of the loan remain the same. 

MS BAKO: Thank you, Mr Speaker. If I get this loan clearly - I also appreciate the number of district roads that have been taken over by the central Government and I appreciate that there is a fragile economic situation now. However, the fact that they have not given us the renegotiated structure of the loan, it would be prudent, in my opinion – The clarification I am seeking is: why do you think in this case you would rather have what I would call a “circumcised” loan other than a full loan, because you are not going to realise that project? 

Between borrowing to the full tune and not borrowing, why wouldn’t you rather abandon the whole situation other than continue to borrow, because you are talking about a drastic reduction. Two kilometres projected in 31 sub counties is a serious amount of resources that we are talking about. So, you are better off not borrowing at all. 

Unless you convince me and my voters in Arua that the roads that were taken over by the central Government can actually help attain the fulfillment of the project, you will be borrowing for the sake of borrowing. Besides, there is already evidence that CAIIP II has not been successful in some districts with some projects not being completed even after Government fully borrowed. I think the structure of the borrowing must convince us as an institution first before we just go on saying that let us now retract the other resolution and amend it. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: For the benefit of the future readers of the Hansard, would the honourable member clarify on what she says has been circumcised? (Laughter) 

MS BAKO: I withdraw that, but what I was saying is when a loan is curtailed or reduced, it is just – 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: So, in your understanding, reduction is circumcision?

MS BAKO: In other words the loan was cut. (Laughter)

MS OSEGGE: Thank you so much, Mr Speaker. The Minister of Finance is intentionally trying to gloss over the issue of terms and conditions of the loan. He has said that the terms and conditions remain the same. In my little understanding of finance and loans, you cannot reduce a loan amount and have the terms remain the same because when talking about terms, you are talking about the interest, the loan period and other things. Can the minister explain how the loan amount reduces and then the loan terms remain the same? 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable minister, please conclude this debate and we will decide.

MR OMACH: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Hon. Angelline Osegge is a professional banker and I am also a professional banker. The loan amount has changed but the maturity period remains 25 years including seven years of grace, and the administrative fee remains the same, at 2.5 percent of the loan for the entire loan period. These are just percentages. I thank you, Mr Speaker. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the issues are clear. The motion before the House is that this Parliament passes a resolution amending its resolution of 2 November 2011 to accommodate the proposals that the initial figure of 7 million Islamic dinars be reduced to 5.5 million Islamic dinars. I put the question. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

MOTION FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT AND DISPOSAL OF ASSETS REGULATIONS FROM PARLIAMENT

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, why is there movement in the House? 

4.42
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Fred Omach): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker and honourable members. I beg to withdraw the Public Procurement and Disposal of Assets Regulations from Parliament. This is occasioned by the fact that my ministry inadvertently brought this to Parliament before passing it through the Cabinet as required by our procedures. I beg to withdraw.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, that is the motion. It is straightforward. A matter was brought to the House prematurely and in law if a particular procedure is bad from the beginning, we say it is void ab initio; in other words, it did not start. Therefore, its being before the House would be irregular. So, the minister is acting diligently after the event to come and withdraw this to have it conform to regulations on public matters. That is the motion, that the matter be withdrawn and it be brought back properly. It does not start operating of course before it is brought back after proper consultations. Do we need to debate this?

4.44
THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Mr Nathan Nandala-Mafabi): Mr Speaker, I know how a Bill or regulation comes to the House. Once they brought the regulations, they were read and were even referred to the committee. I am sure they are in a committee; I saw the notice board calling people to attend meetings and to make recommendations. All this process has been going on. I even saw it in the newspapers. At what time did the minister discover that he missed a step? 

Sometimes people make mistakes but this is a really terrible mistake. You have brought a law, what is the justification for you to withdraw it? If you think that Cabinet never blessed it and Parliament has got it and members of Cabinet are part of Parliament, why don’t we continue, unless there is reason beyond doubt that when you pass this into law, there will be another problem? Otherwise, failure to do that, you can go and handle it in the committee. 

Mr Speaker, is it really right for something we have dealt with - the committee has sat, they have taken tea and mandazi –(Laughter) - which is a cost, they have even vetted people and I am sure members of the finance committee are here and –(Mr Kasule Ssebunya rose_)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: On what point does the honourable member rise? Can I know what is happening here? 

MR KASULE SSEBUNYA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am giving information to the Leader of the Opposition. We have spent many man hours critiquing these regulations and like he said, we have essentially spent on the regulations. So, my prayer is, once Parliament agrees that government withdraws these regulations, they should come back not substantially changed because the many members we have talked to have said that these regulations are very urgent. Many institutions and agencies cannot go forward with procurement or they have delayed procurement processes because of these regulations. So, I am praying that the minister urgently works on the process of Cabinet. Otherwise, we have spent a lot of time on these regulations. That is the information I am giving. 

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Speaker, I am not bothered with my brother Ssebunya’s point. The issue is that the committee sat, and he has talked of man hours, and we pay them for sitting there. Now after all that, the minister comes to withdraw the regulations. 

When we pass our budgets, I think the first item that they attach is the procurement plan, and that procurement plan is the one which determines how they are going to do the procurement in every unit. These regulations are basically to help in the process. I do not think it is right for us to allow the minister to withdraw them. If he wants to withdraw, let him go and make the substantive amendments at the committee level but these regulations should go ahead because they are overdue.

Members, if you will allow, the reason why these regulations came was for purposes of tying loopholes in wastage in procurement. Now the government is saying that they are going to arrest and then a week after these rules have passed, they want to withdraw them. We should not allow the minister to withdraw these rules. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I was watching the Olympics recently and there was one man throwing the discus and he really made a good throw. He beat everybody else, but then the red flag was raised at the start point. So, when the person planting the stick at the point looked at the red flag, they nullified the whole process. It does not matter how much effort you have put in a process that is not legitimately within the law.

Therefore, should we continue compounding an illegality - a procedural illegality - when we already know that it was irregular? Should we be party to that? 

MR KYOOMA: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am seeking your guidance because these regulations being talked about were laid here before Parliament and committed to the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development, where I am member. Thereafter, we were informed that actually, they were needed urgently.

Because of that, as a committee, we had to dedicate all the time we had to these regulations to the extent that we even had a retreat on the same matter. During this retreat, we would work up to midnight, reading regulation by regulation, line by line. We even had the senior ministers in this retreat.

MS KAMATEKA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Is the Member in order, after the Speaker has ruled that no matter how much effort you have put in, the Bill can be withdrawn? According to Rule 124, a Bill may be withdrawn with the authority of Parliament and we have been given the reasons. Is the Member in order, therefore, to continue debating when the Speaker has guided that it is okay for the Bill to be withdrawn? 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, it is very different for somebody to say that some provisions in the Bill are wrong. That one, you can go to the committee and amend. But to say that a step has been missed, that legitimises the whole process; it is a different matter; a different ball game altogether. The rule that has been cited by the Member is clear. 

Unfortunately, it is not one of those rules where you can say that we withhold our permission to withdraw and yet you already have notice that steps have been missed in this process. Ordinarily, the Speaker would have just said, “Well, we have done this and that, proceed; let the ministers go there and correct this.” Unfortunately, the step that has been missed cannot be corrected in the committee. Somebody will cite this in the future to challenge the regulation.

Somebody will say that that thing never received Cabinet approval. It was improperly before the House. What would we do then, when it is a regulation that has been gazetted? What we can say is that the honourable minister takes this, they go through the process, come back to the committee and it will continue from where it has stopped so as to expedite the process. But this step, we certainly cannot forego. Can we? Can we forego a process that is in the public law?

MR SSEMUJJU: Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your guidance. For me the point is about the casual way of handling serious matters. The Ministry of Finance is a very vast ministry with a lot of staff. Why did it go to sleep and totally forget that this is a very serious procedure before you table regulations in Parliament? This is how they have been committing this country. Assuming it was an agreement committing this country to billions, would you have walked to the person with whom you signed an agreement to say, “Please, I forgot. Now, I have come to withdraw the contract.” This is a serious a matter for which Parliament must exercise its authority with caution. We may allow the withdrawal of the regulations but we must caution Government about this casual way of doing public business. 

So, you go to sleep and then you come to say, “We forgot; now, we table a motion to withdraw regulations.” What guarantee does the country have that is not how you have been committing our future by casually handling documents? So, someone can go and throw a document somewhere and then the following day, he says they made a mistake.

We have just been debating the issue of IDs here and we are told that people who ordinarily are not supposed to be technical are the ones leading technical committees to go and inspect the machines. Do we have a Government? Are you guys in Government serious? Do you care about this country anymore?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, if this House had been unanimous about this matter, I was going to make some consequential order about what the minister should do about this. If we are together, then I can proceed and then we make the order.

The motion is for withdrawal of the PPDA regulations from Parliament; that is the motion. I will put a question to it.

MR KYOOMA: Mr Speaker, We have to appreciate that some of us are still new legislators. I rose on a matter of guidance on this matter. I wanted to get your wise guidance. A colleague raised a point of order and I thought thereafter, I should have been given an opportunity to seek your guidance because up to now, I have not got the guidance I wanted on the same matter. I am actually a member of the committee.

Therefore, don’t you think that procedurally, it would be right to give me an opportunity to ask you for guidance such that you guide me on the matter?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: You had asked your guidance, honourable member; did you have two guidance points?

MR KYOOMA: The guidance matter I wanted to raise was for you to guide me, at what point the minister can withdraw these regulations or the Bill, when actually, they have been substantively handled by the committee and it is in the final stages of presenting the final position? 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: It is at any time before Parliament pronounces itself on it. (Laughter) There are Bills that have been withdrawn after debates have started. I put the question to the motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I direct, accordingly, that Cabinet sits on Wednesday and this matter should be taken back. On Thursday next week, this matter should be brought back to Parliament to enable the committee complete its work.

4.58
THE THIRD DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (Lt Gen. (Rtd) Moses Ali): Mr Speaker, there was an omission in the process of this Bill coming to Parliament. It should have gone to Cabinet first, but having realised that omission, Cabinet asked the minister to withdraw. This is to give Cabinet chance to go through it and then it is brought back with the comments of the Cabinet.

Now, the communication is that if the committee continues -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, the committee is not continuing, Rt Honourable. What I have directed is that this matter goes back, you look at it on Wednesday, because I presume Cabinet sits on Wednesday and then get the necessary approval and come back to the House on Thursday, lay it properly this time and then it goes back to the committee and they finalise with whatever they were finalising. Then they come back so that we do not lose time.  That is what I had directed. 

LT GEN. (RTD) MOSES ALI:  That, therefore, means that the chairman of the committee will give us the –(Interruption)

MR WADRI: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I have high regard for Lt Gen. Moses Ali, a very senior Member from West Nile. The procedural assistance I would like to get from you is as to whether we should go back and forth on a matter that has already been laid to rest; a matter that we have already had a vote on? I thought that he had brought it to an end. From the way he is proceeding, are we going to open it for another debate? I seek your guidance, Mr Speaker. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Rt Hon. Leader of Government Business, I had already guided – actually, made a directive after a vote. That directive remains. Do the necessary and come back to the House next week on Thursday so that the committee can finalise the process. 

CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE SECTORAL COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE AND INTERNAL AFFAIRS ON THE INQUIRY INTO THE PROCUREMENT OF EQUIPMENT FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (NSIS); THE NATIONAL ID PROJECT

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, we had two days of debate and we were going towards closing it up for Parliament to take a decision on this matter. I am going to revert to the Frontbench of Government to make some responses and we take a decision on the matter. 

5.01
THE MINISTER OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr Hillary Onek): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. This is a response to key issues raised in the report of the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs on the inquiry into the procurement of equipment for the National Security Information System (NSIS) together with the contribution you made in Parliament. So, we have come up with a response as follows: 

The report is clear and categorical like all the debates in Parliament are. There is critical need to establish the NSIS in order to identify and register citizens and also issue to them national identity cards. 
 
The President had more fundamental reasons why he was keen to have the NSIS put in place, namely, to address the problems inherited from the colonial and post-independence era of lack of reliable voters’ register and, therefore, the efforts of the NRM to ensure the integrity in elections by resolving the problems. 

The production of photo-bearing voter cards did not solve the problem because the challenge of multiple registrations continued and the NSIS Project was to address this conclusively. 

When, therefore, the NSIS equipment was procured, the first phase was to fulfill the objective of Government and the following were achieved during that phase: Equipment was acquired and delivered; 8 million virgin cards were delivered; and using the equipment advanced to the Electoral Commission, 5.2 million new voters were registered and the elections of 2011 were successfully concluded, which was a key primary objective in the first phase.  In phase I, the equipment was basically used to produce 5.2 million voter cards with all the biometrics in them. 

Moving onto the second phase, which we are now in, included undertaking the following - this is on the Government side; once the contract to supply equipment and the software were done, the second phase was Government responsibility; that is:

i.	To establish a personalised and data centre to secure ID cards production. We needed a home for the NSIS equipment.
 
ii.	Mass enrolment of the rest of the citizens and alien residents in Uganda. At the time, it was estimated at 31 million, but today, we are talking about 34 million.
 
iii.	Issuance of 15 million national identity cards for only those aged 18 and above

iv.	Develop a national identification register for input into that National Population Data Bank. Although this project of the national identity card was under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, all this data was to be hosted and stored at the National Data Bank, which is under the Ministry of ICT. 

v.	Recruit and train staff for capacity development. We have a layout structure for this; every sub-county was to have an office for registration of births and deaths and also for capturing data for those who are over 18 years and qualify for the national identity cards, so that identity cards are produced and sent to the sub-counties. Recruitment of staff was to establish that office permanently. 

Why did we choose to buy the equipment?  Because we wanted to have production done here continuously so that we do not have to contract foreign companies each time to come and do the registration. 

Funds to operationalise the above activities have so far not been availed through the budget process because our resource envelope has not been able to meet that.
 
In moving to clarify on the issues raised in the report and on Floor of Parliament, permit me also, Mr Speaker, to raise issues the President raised at the initiation of the NSIS Project, namely: 

i.	To cross-check  his instructions were clear the company’s performance especially in Congo Brazzaville where that company was doing a similar exercise; and 

ii.	To check on the comparative prices of the service from similar companies in the region; and consult PPDA on the feasibility of single-sourcing.

The questions raised in the report by the committee and also in the House when you were contributing were summarised as follows: 

Why did the Ministry of Internal Affairs interfere in the project which was for the Electoral Commission and Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS)?  

Our response is as follows:

The goal of the NSIS is to establish a biometric national identity register upon which the issuance of ID cards and numbers will be based and the national identification register shall be an input into the national data bank.  

Article 16 of the 1995 Constitution establishes a National Citizenship and Immigration Board and mandates it to register citizens and aliens living in the country for purposes of issuing national identity cards, numbers and creating a national identity register. 

Part IV of CAP 66 of the Uganda Citizenship and Immigration Control Act operationalises the constitutional        requirements to register citizens, issue national identification numbers and national identity cards. Those were obligations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs by law. 

Since the National Citizenship and Immigration Board is under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the lead role was assigned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs to coordinate all the stakeholders, including Electoral Commission, Uganda Bureau of Statistics, the ICT Ministry, which provided the secretariat for this exercise. We integrated all stakeholders in the project. In fact, the implementation of the NSIS project has been an all-stakeholder affair with the Ministry of Internal Affairs playing the lead role.

Secondly, summarising the concerns raised in the report and your contributions; there was inadequate planning, budgeting and stakeholder participation. Our response here is that two studies were conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in collaboration with several stakeholders in 2009/2010 and the reports are available. The feasibility studies were to determine, among others, the viability of the project and its cost effectiveness. 

Mr Speaker, I have the reports here, which I would like to table - 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable minister, what was that? 

MR ONEK: What I am tabling is justification, objectives and technical feasibility of the National Identity Card Project.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: By whom and from whom?

MR ONEK: This was a study by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The author is the Ministry of Internal Affairs -(Interjections)- I know that this is a document for the ministry. It belongs to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the author is Ministry of Internal Affairs -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is it dated?  

MR ONEK: Yes. It is dated on the main cover, December 2008. (Mr Wadri rose_)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Wadri, on what point do you rise?

MR WADRI: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In this Parliament, we are guided by processes and procedures. And so, for any document to be tabled and to be relied upon, we must know the source and we must know the author. There cannot be a document that is laid on Table whose author we are not sure of. Hon. Onek is a senior member of this House. He has been on the front bench for some time and this, he knows. 

Mr Speaker, can the honourable minister, either withdraw this statement which is not clear to us or substantiate it by telling us the source and the author so that it can be admissible to this honourable Parliament? Can he please do that before we can move to the next step of moving against him on a point of order? 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, hon. Wadri for your wise ruling. (Laughter) I was investigating to see whether that document would be admissible or not, but you have opted to rule on the subject. Thank you for your wise ruling. 

Honourable minister, you know the rules about what kind of documents we can admit. We need an author, we need a date and we need a subject, because if a document is not fine, it will be difficult for us to follow up especially when it is in that form. And it will be difficult for us - but you can rely on it as your - but we will not take it as part of the record of our Parliament. 

MR ONEK: As I said, this document is from the Ministry of Internal Affairs’ technical team with the assistance from the Japanese experts who were recruited.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: So, who are the people who own the report?

MR ONEK: That is why the ministry owns it.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Speaker, No.2 says there was inadequate planning, budgeting and stakeholder participation and there is a feasibility study as a response. The feasibility study is for a project. It determines whether the project should be implemented or not. 

So, is it procedurally right for the Minister to come and say the ministry did a feasibility study and the report is not signed; yet it was the basis on which the project was implemented? 

Wouldn’t it be procedurally right for him to submit these reports of 2009/2010 or if he gave it to the committee he should tell us that he gave it to the committee. The way I know hon. Mulongo and his team, they would have said they got it. So, what was the basis? Mr Speaker, isn’t it something wrong?   

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Mafabi, the honourable minister is making responses to matters that were raised here. He has discretion to rely on whatever document he wants to rely on. That one, he can do. But this House reserves the right as to what kind of document it can admit as part of its record. So, he can rely on whatever information he has, that is within his discretion to do. We know the standards that the documents we admit here have to meet. Therefore, let him rely on the document he has, but we will be entitled to ask some questions on those ones. 

MR JAMES BABA: Mr Speaker, I represented my senior minister in presenting our position before the committee when the committee was sitting and I remember the same question was asked. However, at the time, there was no requirement or request that I produce that report. But this issue arose again on the Floor of Parliament and that is why we are bringing it here. The report hon. Onek is presenting is a report of a feasibility study undertaken with support from the Japanese technical team and our staff to undertake the feasibility in the implementation of this project. That is why we are laying it here. It was raised during the committee and later when it was being debated, that issue arose again and we thought it was prudent to bring it again to the Floor of Parliament.

So, with your permission, allow hon. Onek to present it -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Now, is the constitution of the membership of this team contained in that document? A faceless document is no document. It has to have human face, just the members who are in that team so that they can own up and usually, honourable minister, it is at the beginning of the document.

MR JAMES BABA: Mr Speaker, there was the Ministry of Internal Affairs, there were representatives from ICT-NITA(U), there was a representative from UBOS and the secondment of the Japanese technical team whose details are not clearly spelt out here. We own this report. The Ministry of Internal Affairs owns this feasibility study. With your permission, Mr Speaker, I can sign it. (Laughter)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable minister, just proceed. Use the information there for your responses.

MR ONEK: Mr Speaker, the Ministry of Internal Affairs relied on this document -(Interjections)- on the information contained in what we have placed on the Table. In addition, the Ministry of Internal Affairs -(Mr Wadri rose_)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Wadri, for a document to be laid formally before the House, I have to say, “It is received and let records capture it as such.” I have not said that.

MR WADRI: Okay, let him withdraw it.

MR ONEK: In addition, the Ministry of Internal Affairs also produced a detailed roadmap which guided the drawing up of the functional requirements, systems, specifications - we have a Department of Immigration which is responsible for this and they came up with a roadmap which is before me here. It is a document of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

There are milestones against which payments should be made. That was a question raised. Why have payments continued when only 400 cards have been issued? That was one of the questions raised by the committee and the Members here. Our response is that the agreement is a supply contract. The supplier delivered all the equipment as specified. Government was expected to provide a ready-to-install building, hire staff and pay for the installation and operation of IDs issuance. Payments to the supplier could, therefore, not be withheld legally. The 409 cards or so issued were a pilot phase of the project.

Is the equipment insured? The answer is that the cost of insurance covered freight of the equipment only up to the warehouse. The procurement process for insurance was completed awaiting availability of funds and as you may know, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is not generating any funds. We all get funds from the source from Ministry of Finance. So, we are still waiting for funds for that insurance.

The next question was, why was there a hurry to complete the transaction? First, there was urgent need for action in order not to disrupt the electoral process. 

Secondly, the Electoral Commission efforts to acquire biometric registration system for use in 2010 scheduled for 12 April 2010 had been halted by the IGG arising out of competing vendors’ complaints. So, the effort by Electoral Commission to acquire similar equipment was halted by the IGG because of complaints of rivaling suppliers.

Thirdly, Government, therefore, decided to acquire a biometric registration system that would serve all Government departments with population registration needs and Electoral Commission inclusive. That was the rationale.

Sixth; was due diligence done to determine that a fair price was paid? Yes. The External Security Organisation (ESO) was tasked to do due diligence on the supplier. The report pointed out some weaknesses, but did not state that the company would fail to deliver. (Interjections) Well, these are institutions of Government, if you do not trust them, then what are you doing here? You have to trust institutions of Government. 

We also made a comparative analysis against bids received in the earlier procurement in similar systems and below are the quotations:

We have a summary of the evaluations of the previous bids here where I would quote two or three companies. Face Technology quoted $94 million; Contec Global US quoted $112.8 million. These two were under a Build, Operate and Transfer arrangement. Muhlbauer quoted $88.3 million equivalent to deliver equipment, blank ID cards and training, and updating of Electoral Commission voters’ registers and related services. 

In view of the need to facilitate the then impending February 2011 elections and in consideration of the fact that Muhlbauer are both solution and equipment manufacturers, determined their selection. Those were the criteria which made the selection of this company.

The visit to Congo Brazzaville was not pursued when it was established that only data was being captured in that country and printing of the cards was being done in Germany at that time. Uganda’s interest lay in controlling the production process and verification of citizens. So, the Congo case could not be similar because the Germans were only capturing the database and then printing in their country.

The guidance to do single sourcing by the President is well documented. There were protracted meetings which were all reflected in the report. A request was made to the PPDA to approve single-sourcing and the latter declined suggesting that open bidding method be followed.

This response which I am reading is in respect to question No.7 which is summarised as follows: That the President’s advisory intervention in the procurement process was relied upon to breach procurement laws and that his advice was not properly followed.

The advice from the PPDA was time barred in the circumstances. The equipment was required for use in the impending voter register updates exercise which was scheduled to begin on 12 April 2010. (Interjections) Consequently, because of the objection to the varying views from PPDA, the President’s guidance was sought on the way forward. PPDA management was invited with other stakeholders like the Ministry of ICT, Finance, Internal Affairs, UBOS and others for a meeting in State House on 15th March, 2010. There was consensus in this meeting on the security nature of the project and, therefore, the decision to use the single sourcing method was adopted. There was no objection from the PPDA during that meeting because their chairman and chief executive were present and they all agreed to that.

Beyond the State House meeting, Government is not aware of any change regarding single sourcing at that time when the procurement was ongoing. The Ministry of Finance gave its clearance on 17th March; the Attorney General also gave clearance on the 19th March, 2010 after which the contract was signed in the spirit that all stakeholders including the PPDA were in agreement with the use of single sourcing.

On question No. 8, there was no pre-shipment inspection of the equipment in Germany, neither was there a technical audit to confirm the content and conditions of the equipment. Under the contract, Muhlbauer was obliged to bring in the specified equipment and use it in Phase I.  The company was to bring this equipment for use and this was for updating the voters’ register and the pilot cards issuance. In addition, when the equipment was delivered into the country, it was tested. The report is attached. 

I think the ministry opted for the equipment to be shipped and tested from here so as not to take responsibility for damages during transit and the rest of it. Equipment which was found not to be functional was rejected and replaced. 

For the personalisation equipment, the technical officials travelled to Germany to ascertain and inspect the nature and condition of the equipment. Three Members of the Parliamentary Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs were on this team. This report is also attached. 

The project’s finances

We have a table here reflecting all the releases made for this project. In accordance with the payment schedule to the project, overall, the total paid to-date to Muhlbauer amounts to € 51,188,730.77, an equivalent of Shs 150,735,527,782. This is in compliance with the contract of supply of equipment and all the software which was supplied with it. That is what they received. On their behalf, taxes were paid to Uganda Revenue Authority to a tune of € 8,335,978. That is equivalent to Shs 26,278,999,146. The sub-total for all those payments is reflected on the next page, page 7. Balance due to the current exchange rate of 3,029 per euro is also recorded here. It is € 4,706,662.72 which is equivalent to Shs 14,527,538,826.

Our observations

With the procurement process, it is possible there was a misunderstanding of the procedures to follow on single sourcing, especially with respect to Section 42 of the PPDA Act, which requires pre-listing for single sourcing procurements at the beginning of the financial year. However, the decision to go single sourcing was made in March, well after the financial year had begun.

The report mentions breach of the procurement law. We, however, need to further examine whether the breach was criminally-intentioned or inadvertent. (Interjections) The professional investigation organs of the state may take over from there if the view is that there were some criminal intentions behind this.

We fully agree with the reported status of the project on page 40 of the report. We fully agree with the recommendations of the report on page 40 and the conclusion of the committee. The project was conceived with good intentions and there is all evidence to show that it is a good project. We also agree with the observation that hindrances to its implementation be cleared and resources and infrastructure provided to bring back the project on course. 

Accordingly, below is the financial requirement for the project to be undertaken immediately. I have attached what was reflected in our budget which unfortunately, the resource envelope in Government did not allow. 

I must conclude with a statement that Muhlbauer fulfilled their part of the project. They were paid and we still have a balance to pay. The government side of establishing a data centre, recruiting manpower, deploying them in all our districts to ensure that there is continuous registration of deaths and births, and updating our citizenship register, our side has not succeeded because of challenges of the resource envelope. That is the state of affairs. Government is doing everything to see that the project is brought back to its feet. 

Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much, honourable members. Honourable members, you will agree that we had a long debate on this subject, which was required. We had sufficient time. I think it was three days of debate on this matter. According to the record, over 100 Members contributed to this debate. I think it would be appropriate for us to begin drawing to a conclusion on this subject. 

The best way we are going to do that – I am going to propose – we do not have an extract in a separate document of the recommendations of the committee and they are quite many. The recommendations are scattered on 12 different pages of the report. What I am going to propose - because some of the recommendations might still attract debate - in order to be orderly in the processing of this decision, I think we are going to go to a stage where we go recommendation-by-recommendation and we take decisions as we go along. If we find a matter which is difficult for us to take a decision on, we can defer the subject until we have had further debate on it. 

I am, therefore, proposing that we go to those stages of recommendations and I will ask the Clerk to read part-by-part because they are in different parts, like part one is on mode of procurement and there are three recommendations. We could go through 1 (a), (b) and (c) one by one and see if we can take a decision on those and if we cannot, we enlarge the debate and capture that particular area so that we move forward on this matter. Is that agreeable? 

MR WADRI: I thank you, Mr Speaker. First of all, I would like to thank the committee chairperson and the minister for the information that he has given us. A few minutes ago, I went out to bring yet another important document; the Auditor-General’s report that also looked into the same matter.

In the minister’s submission and responses to the issues that were raised, I have seen a lot of misleading information and I do not know at what stage, we will be able to iron out the misleading information vis-à-vis the recommendations that have been proposed by the committee. Will it necessitate us to make responses to the glaring and misleading information that the minister has given us at this stage or will it be when we are fine-tuning the recommendations? I seek your guidance, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, without going into fresh debate on this matter, can I suggest that we allow a moment for Members to raise issues of clarification on the matter that has just been raised by the minister and it should strictly be on issues of clarification. That means short questions so that we can have this and begin drawing to a close on this matter; because some of the issues will come when a particular recommendation is proposed and then you can still have a short discussion on it. If you want to change or amend, but if you agree with it, then there is no point extending a debate on it. Are we – you see, when I have finished guiding and then you still rise on a point of guidance, it makes me wonder whether I am guiding the House or not.

MR SSEMUJU: I thank you, Mr Speaker. I am seeking further guidance and not to suggest that the one that you have given is – I intend, as a result of the information and issues that were raised during the debate, to propose a fresh recommendation in addition to the committee recommendation   -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: That is allowed.

MR SSEMUJJU: At what stage do I do that, Mr Speaker?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: If it is a general recommendation, we wait at the end but if it is specific because these ones are clustered. If it falls within a particular area and you know the area from where it should come - I said they were on 12 different pages and they capture different subjects so that when we come there, you can bring it there, but if it is part of a general recommendation, then as we draw to a close, we can then deal with that. That is what I am proposing so that we can find a way of finishing with this. 

This is still on procedural issues. Let us deal with procedural issues first and then we start making the clarifications. Yes, hon. Nandala-Mafabi?

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: The procedural issue I am raising is that we have documents that the minister has given us attached, and one of them is the report of the due diligence that was done. In that report, Members – it has these figures if you check inside. The report is dated 18 February, 2010. It has five pages, but not signed. Will it be procedurally right for us to rely on this report which was done by ESO and never signed? That is one.

The second is about the report dated 12 July, 2010. It is also not signed and yet it talks about so many things. Were these just forgeries or they wanted to do something to deal with that?

The other point is about PPDA. We have a report, in which PPDA says that it has refused and it was dated 12 March, 2012. Now, the minister is saying that PPDA accepted and that was on – is it possible to have -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Nandala-Mafabi, I thought you were raising procedural issues, but you are now raising issues that will need you to seek clarification from the minister and yet that is where I thought we were going if we finish with these preliminary procedural matters. 

If there are other procedural matters that we need to clarify from what I have guided, we can finish with those, then we start going on the line that you are going to raise questions that the minister will be required to make some responses to. 

On the documents, there is not a single document that the minister has come with that we have accepted apart from those that were attached to the report. We have not accepted any and the records are clear on what my ruling is. So, if you are going to rely on the document because the minister has referred to it, then that one is a different matter, but not because it is part of the official record of this House.

So, if we agreed that that is how we are going to proceed, we will limit issues - if you know that your issue is going to be captured in the discussion on the recommendation, do not raise it now, but wait when we come there and for your information, look at pages 11, 14, 16, 19, 21, 23, 27, 28, 32, 34 and 37 of the committee report. Those pages contain the recommendations of the committee and so, if the issue that you want to raise as a matter of clarification from the minister is contained in those, then wait for that time when we come there, then you can raise so that the debate is consequential and can lead us to a proper conclusion. 

MR SABIITI: This project from the statement made by the minister and indeed the committee is not a classified project - 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: You are now debating?

MR SABITI: No, I am not. It is procedural –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: You want a procedural –

MR SABIITI: I am coming to it, Mr Speaker. Even if ESO was involved, there is a requisite procedure that is used if it is classified - that is used to work on such projects. Now, I wanted to seek guidance from them because this is very important –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Sabiiti -

MR SABIITI: This is very important –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The procedural point that I am referring to is related to how we proceed with the conclusion of this –

MR SABIITI: I see.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Now, what you are raising is what I have said for the minster to respond to and that is not a procedural issue. The procedural question that I am trying to iron out is that how do we proceed with the processing of this decision? So, if there is none, I can then open for points of clarifications to be raised to the minister and I again say - because I have seen the whole House standing – no, no, but I have seen the whole standing and that cannot mean that all of you want to discuss things outside these recommendations because we are going to come to these recommendation one by one.

Can we do it this way – you see, we are not going to start debating the report again. We had three days of debate on this – and all the members who were present in the House on those days contributed. We now need to take a decision and move forward. Okay, this is from what the minster has said. Can we allow some comments on this? Raise your matter in one minute. I will start from this side. 

5.48
MR PAUL MWIRU (FDC, Jinja Municipality, Jinja): Thank you so much, Mr Speaker. I am seeking clarification from the minister. The document he has presented tends to justify the project. So, the clarification I am seeking is, is he aware that we are actually dealing with a nullity; that the law is to the effect that procedure ought to have been followed. They did not follow the procedure. Does the justification of an illegality ratify whatever was done illegally? 

Whereas I am seeking that clarification, I am still aware that there are people in this country who look at honest people as failures in life and dishonest people as successful people. Because I realise that people are trying to scheme and do window-dressing to overturn the law. So, that –(Member timed out.)

5.50
MR ODONGA OTTO (FDC, Aruu County, Pader): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Can the minister tell us how much money the country has lost? Secondly, the PPDA Act provides for some statutory offences. In your statement, why are you defending the criminals, that they might have done it unintentionally? Why have you appointed yourself to be their defence lawyer? Thank you. (Laughter)

5.51
MS BETTY AMONGI (UPC, Oyam County South, Oyam): The clarification I want from the minister is on the single-sourcing, where he indicates that His Excellency guided on it. He goes on to say that they went ahead in the spirit that all stakeholders, including PPDA, were in agreement. 

I want to know, in view of the findings of the committee, that indeed PPDA said that they were not consulted and they did not agree; and we had letters from His Excellency saying that the ministries should consult PPDA. Do you agree with the committee recommendation on ministries that did not follow PPDA taking responsibility?

5.51
MS SANTA ALUM (UPC, Woman Representative, Oyam): Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question to the minister is; we are now in phase II; we have finished phase I; when will Muhlbauer hand over this project to the Electoral Commission? Because time again, when we have by-elections, we still see Muhlbauer officials coming. The Electoral Commission cannot update the register. So, when will they hand over, since we are now in phase II? 

Secondly, Mr Minister, Parliament appropriated Shs 30 billion to the Electoral Commission and now we are seeing many stakeholders in this project. You went on to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Electoral Commission for the ministry to use this money on behalf of the Electoral Commission. Are we not going to see a similar action of this nature since this project is still going on? As Parliament –(Member timed out.)

MR JACK SABIITI (FDC, Rukiga County, Kabale): Mr Speaker, this was not a classified project and this project did not follow the proper procedure. May I know why it took the direction it took.

Secondly, if you look at Article 99 of our Constitution, Schedule No.4 regarding the Presidential swearing-in, why didn’t you include the President in this report in your recommendations? Why didn’t you include him as one of those who erred?

5.53
MS FLORENCE EKWAU (FDC, Woman Representative, Kaberamaido): Mr Minister, what was the use of the Inter-ministerial Committee, which included your ministry?

Secondly, after sitting in various meetings, including your permanent secretary and the batch of technical teams, you were supposed to advise Government. Now that you did not advise Government – Government spent money on you in the various meetings - are you going to refund the wasted monies that were spent in the meetings? What advice did you give Government on a project that was going wrong from the start? Refund our money! Thank you. (Laughter) 

5.54
MR KENNETH LUBOGO (Independent, Bulamogi County, Kaliro): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am referring to observation No.2 on page 7. Minister, this is a ridiculous observation in your report, because you are pushing it back to us; you seem not to be aware about whether what you did was in good faith; whether it was criminal or whether it was advertent or inadvertent. 

Are you telling us that you cannot know whether your actions were done deliberately or they were done with hidden motives? You are leaving it to us to judge whether what you did was as such. Can’t you give an opinion on what you did? Thank you.

5.55
MS JESCA ABABIKU (Independent, Woman Representative, Adjumani): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to know how the start-up capital was a problem if there was adequate planning and budgeting. 

Secondly, I want to know whether in the guidance of the President, there was a provision for consulting other stakeholders in order to come up with a resolution.

Thirdly, I want to know whether the minister prioritised the importance of following the PPDA regulations when he convened several meetings for consensus.

5.56
MR JOSEPH KIYINGI (Independent, Mawokota County South, Mpigi): Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is in respect to issue No.4. Why didn’t you take the initiative to insure the equipment after it reached the warehouse, considering the fact that fires are a risk in Uganda and the theft that is being reported? Also, do advise us as far as the warranty of the equipment is concerned. Was the equipment actually having any warranty? Thank you very much.

5.56
MR IBRAHIM SSEMUJJU (FDC, Kyadondo County East, Wakiso): Mr Speaker, the minister says the reason they acted in haste was because of the general elections. This project was to cover just about 4 million voters, mainly the new ones. Can the minister tell Parliament whether the whole credibility of this election was pegged only on the new voters, because the project did not cover the old ones? 

Secondly, what happened to the equipment the Electoral Commission had procured earlier that it used for the photographic voter registration; the equipment that cost taxpayers more than Shs 30 billion?

5.57
MR FOX ODOI-OYWELOWO (Independent, West Budama County North, Tororo): Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is in respect to the minister’s response to issue No.3. 

Honourable minister, this was a supply contract and the obligations of the supplier were well-known. Your obligations were also well-known and we have captured them as including the provision of a ready-to-install building, the hire of staff, and payment for the installation and operation of the ID issuance. Did you reflect these obligations in your road map?

Secondly, where is that building and how far have you gone with your obligations. Thank you.

5.58
MR SAM OTADA (Independent, Kibanda County, Kiryandongo): Thank you, Mr Speaker. This project was supposed to be a turn-key project if you look at page 3, because it has the first phase and the second phase. The second phase is actually the phase that would have qualified it to be a national ID project. Now that we have accomplished only the first phase and we have no funds for the second phase so that we can accomplish the national ID project objectives, Mr Minister, do you still want to convince this House and the country that this was actually not a project for managing elections only? That it wasn’t a project for a national ID strategy? Would you like to respond to that?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Nandala-Mafabi, you have two minutes instead of one. 

5.59
THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Mr Nathan Nandala-Mafabi): Mr Speaker, thank you for the opportunity. If you read the minister’s report, on page 3, he says they had to acquire this system. Under 5, the IGG had halted it because there were complaints from vendors. That meant that there were many people who could supply this equipment because you have talked of Face Technologies and others. If there were more people who could supply, why did the ministry insist on Muhlbauer only, yet there were more people and complaints?

Mr Speaker, there is No.6 on the weaknesses, saying that the ESO people did due diligence But I do not know whether ESO people had the competences. If they did, where is the report, because the one we see here is not signed? Is it this one attached to your report? 

On page 5, No.7; PPDA rejected the request on 12 March 2010. They said they wanted it urgently because of the voter’s registration, which was to take place on 12 April 2010. That was one month after. When PPDA rejected and you went against them, did the system work and if it worked, where are the results? 

Mr Speaker, I want to ask the minister finally to tell us which feasibility study he used. I am asking this because if he is saying that his ministry was the one to depend on - the President had directed that you go to Congo Brazzaville. That meant that the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Uganda had no competence. So, they had to go somewhere to study. How would you depend on the same ministry staff who had no competence in this field to produce a report on which you depended? 

I have here a copy of the agenda dated 10 July 2012 for a meeting by the National Resistance Movement, Office of the Government Chief Whip, Chairperson NRM Parliamentary Caucus. It has the following items: Prayers; communication from the chair; discussion of the report of the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs on the inquiry into the procurement of equipment of the National Security Information System (NSIS) – The national ID project. 

The clarification I am seeking is: Is this the reason why we didn’t have plenary yesterday? Was it because our colleagues wanted to consult and discuss this report on the ID project, and if it is true they went –(Member timed out.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, on the last issue you raised, the House was adjourned by myself. According to the Hansard, I stated the reasons for which the adjournment was being made to today; the reasons are in the Hansard. It was not even contemplated that these meetings were going to take place. I think they took advantage of the adjournment and held them. They could have held it on Sunday or even last Friday. So, please don’t draw the leadership of the House into these kinds of matters. The House was adjourned by myself to today and the reasons were stated accordingly. 

Honourable members, all of you debated this matter. So, if you did not debate, your time to debate passed. This time now is for making an inquiry into what the minister has just said. So, I will have hon. Faisal Kikulukunyu. One minute please.

6.04
MR FAISAL KIKULUKUNYU (NRM, Butambala County, Butambala): Thank you, Mr Speaker. The minister did say in the report that ESO was tasked to do due diligence on the suppliers and that the report produced had so many weaknesses. Can the minister further elaborate on some of the weaknesses that were identified in the report? 

Secondly, they talk of technical people going to Germany, among whom were MPs. Can we know how technical the MPs who travelled to Germany were?

6.05
MR YONA MUSINGUZI (NRM, Ntungamo Municipality, Ntungamo): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to inquire from the minister why they had to militarize the whole process of procurement by using ESO and Ministry of Defence officials, as if Government had become a military state. What was the problem? Why couldn’t it follow the right procedures of procurement? This was so bad. We are at a time when we have very many illegal immigrants, very many Indians and Chinese who are here illegally; this would be our checkpoint. We cannot go on like this. 

I also want to know of the technical officers who went to Germany, how many were they and how much did the government spend on them? As if whatever they had stolen was not enough! We want our money; we want this system implemented, minister! 

6.07
MR PETER BAKALUBA MUKASA (NRM, Mukono County South, Mukono): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Legally, I want to know the fate of these two mentioned companies: Face Technologies and Contec Global, which had earlier passed through the procurement process but were not considered as they zeroed on Muhlbauer.

Secondly, I want to know whether the Office of the Attorney-General has ever been served with a notice of intention to sue from these two companies because they were aggrieved. They had won the contract, but were not given the tender. 

Lastly, Muhlbauer - as a person who had actually introduced Muhlbauer Company to either the President or the government - wanted his commission and committed Muhlbauer to court. I don’t know how this case ended. I would like to know whether his $4 million were paid. 

6.07
MR JAMES KABAJO KYEWALABYE (NRM, Kiboga County East, Kiboga): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I only have one issue. The minister concurs with the report that the implementation should be cleared and resources, and that the infrastructure should be provided to bring the project back on course. However, he says below are the financial requirements - see page 8, No.2; he is saying that to support operations countrywide, he is providing for Shs 2.9 billion and I am really wondering whether the minister is realistic to provide for countrywide operations in this country Uganda at only Shs 2.9 billion –(Member timed out.)

6.08
MS HARRIET NTABAZI (NRM, Woman Representative, Bundibugyo): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have a question for the minister concerning item 3 on page 3. The 409 cards which were issued were in a pilot stage and I know that this pilot stage was supposed to cover Members of Parliament, but what I understand is that there are Members of Parliament who have not yet got the ID cards. Which criteria did you use in selecting the Members of Parliament who got the cards? 

Secondly, in the observation, he indicated how there was a breach of law under his supervision. Mr Speaker, for how long are we going to really support some of these things, when we know that there is a problem here? How are we going to continue to support such ministers just because we are on board with government? What are we going to do with such ministers whose material is really –(Member timed out.)

6.10
MR PATRICK MULINDWA (NRM, Kasambya County, Mubende): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am aware that there was phase one of the project and it was to do with the purchase of equipment and materials and I am aware that we already have the materials and equipment. May I know from the minister whether Government has provided money for phase two, which is implementation? 

6.10
MR JOHN AMOS OKOT (NRM, Agago County, Agago): Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is on page 4, where it is clearly stated that there were some quotations from Face Technologies, and Contec Global, of US dollars of that kind. Do you have evidence for this kind of information you are giving and if so, did you give it to the committee or why don’t you attach it here for us to see?

Secondly, on page 5, you said that there was an overwhelming consensus when the PPDA also attended the meeting. Why is it that the PS and the former minister were pleading with the PPDA executive? For example, they say, “… the purpose of this communication is, therefore, to request you to write…” if there was consensus, why were they pleading again, as shown in this report? Thank you.
 
6.12
MR NELSON SABILA (NRM, Kongasis County, Bukwo): Mr Speaker, my question to the honourable minister is that, this project started way back in the 2011 general elections. Now that the 2011 general elections have passed, is it also going to surpass this period of 2016 so that we go into another era before we have this project, because we are tired of endless projects? Thank you. 

6.12
MR EDDIE KWIZERA (NRM, Bufumbira County East, Kisoro): Mr Speaker, I don’t know if the minister believes in what he is presenting to the House because if he believed in it, he should at least have signed or indicated the source of the response. So, I think that is a very big anomaly. Here, I know that nobody doubts the Auditor-General. We have a report here, the document is here and what did the Auditor-General find? He said there was no feasibility study. It is on page 26, contrary to what the minister has said on page 3. There was no detailed plan as indicated on page 263; there was no pre-shipment as indicated by the minister; and there was no progressive report. The inter-ministerial committee never sat even a single day because there is no evidence; there should have been minutes availed to the auditors. So, we should be looking at value-for-money and not defending something that is bad. We should be looking at the way forward. It is a shame for my government to be defending a deal gone bad. 

6.15
MR MICHAEL MAWANDA (NRM, Igara County East, Bushenyi): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am seeking clarification from the minister on three issues. One is on page 4 where he is making a comparative analysis of the prices quoted by various companies. The original project was the National Data Bank and Identification Project, and one of the outputs was the issuance of IDs. The quotation that was made by Muhlbauer is for the production of IDs only, which is one of the outputs out of more than eight outputs, at a cost of US$ 88.3 million compared to the quotation that was made by these other companies: Face Technologies and Contec Global, which was supposed to deliver a turn-key project –(Member timed out.)

6.16
MR JOHN MULIMBA (NRM, Samia-Bugwe County North, Busia): Mr Speaker, I thank you. I have only three questions to ask the minister. I would like to know at what stage of the procurement process this national ID project became a classified project.

Secondly, what qualifies a project to be a classified project? Thirdly, how come a classified project after procurement is now handed over to civil authorities like the national Electoral Commission for use if really there was no ill-intention? I thank you. 

6.16
DR CHRIS BARYOMUNSI (NRM, Kinkiizi East County, Kanungu): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The first question that I want the minister to clarify is whether he is being clever by not identifying with this report because he doesn’t indicate it is from him. So, is he being clever or does he want to tell us he doesn’t actually agree and believe in what he has presented?

Secondly, the Constitution and various laws give powers and authority to different institutions. Is it the minister’s understanding that when an institution has refused and a meeting is called in State House, then a State House meeting takes over the power and authority of that institution like PPDA in this case?

Three, can the minister use this opportunity to tell Ugandans not to pay for national IDs as the Minister of Finance announced recently? Thank you very much.

6.16
MR WAMAKUYU MUDIMI (NRM, Bulambuli County, Bulambuli): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want the minister to clarify on item No.7 on page 5, where he says “…beyond the State House meeting, Government is not aware of any change of position of single-sourcing…” And we have a letter here written by the PPDA to PS, Ministry of Internal Affairs on 12th December, warning them of not going for outsourcing. Which is which? Is it March 2010 or December 2011? The State House meeting was in March 2010, where the PPDA was invited; then the letter - PPDA’s rejection - was written on 12 December 2011, but the minister said that beyond the State House meeting, Government was not aware of any change. Can you clarify on that?

6.18
MR ROBERT SSEBUNYA (NRM, Kyadondo County North, Wakiso): Thank you, Mr Speaker. On page 2 of the minister’s report, it is noted that Article 16 of the 1995 Constitution establishes a national citizenship board and mandates it to register citizens and aliens living in Uganda. 

Why is this project not under this board? And yet this board has a vote? 

Secondly, when Cabinet sits and decides on a procurement method, maybe single-sourcing, isn’t it part of the procurement laws as per the PPDA Act?

MR KAGWERA: Thank you Mr Speaker. My question to the honourable minister is on the reason why he was in a hurry. The answer you have given is that you wanted to save the Electoral Commission, but both programmes are Government programmes and they are planned for, why hurry? Electoral Commission and elections are in our programme and budget, why did you have to hurry?

Secondly; they talked about checking the performance of other companies, comparing the prices and the PPDA. These are things that should have been done first, but you put them in the second phase. I want to know why? 

The issue of whether it was criminally intentioned or inadvertent. How are we going to draw the line between the two? Because these are officials who are trained to handle matters but now we are leaving them with a gap of saying that at times we you can do it accidently and we forgive you.

I want to know why the honourable minister has brought this up.

MS BABADIRI: Thank you so much, Mr Speaker. In the report, the last recommendation says that project is very good and should continue. I had the opportunity to see the national identity card. My colleague had it here. 

It was really of poor quality. Is the minister going to continue with this one, or are they going to make better cards?

THE SPEAKER: Obviously, hon. Babadiri has seen this card. Honourable minister please give some quick responses so that we make progress on this. Thank you Members for sticking to the one minute and it has worked.

6.38
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr James Baba): I will attempt to answer the issues raised by the honourable members – 

THE SPEAKER: Are you saying you are going to attempt? You mean you have no answers for them?

MR BABA: I am going to answer them, Rt Hon. Speaker. But in answering them, I will attempt them.

Was the Procurement legal? 

We still think that the procurement arrangement made was legal. We tried our best to consult and to follow up. We consulted; there was consensus; and we moved on that basis - from the highest authority on the land. (Interjections)

How much was lost during this procurement? 

In the report of the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs, there was no clear indication of any loss in the report.

There was reference to exchange rate losses, but these are external to us. We do not control the exchange rate regime externally. The Euro to the Shilling, the Euro to the Dollar is certainly beyond us.

Secondly, on the actual cost of the equipment, Muhlbauer has not come to us saying we have delayed in payments or that they are imposing penalties on us; none so far whatsoever. As far as we are concerned, there are no penalties. We have been up to date with our payments to Muhlbauer except for the last one which was due in June, but they have not submitted any penalties to us.

In view of the findings; will you take responsibility? 

We have made in our observations that for those who have breached the procurement requirements, please let us put it to the investigative machinery of the state to find out who is culpable and who is not, and let the law take its course. This is a firm recommendation I would like to reiterate.

When will Muhlbauer hand over? 

Shs 30 billion was paid to the EC and yet we had a memorandum of understanding with the EC. What happened to those monies?

The committee report clearly indicates that the EC procurement was botched. There were in-fights - contending parties fighting over that contract - and the IGG stopped that procurement; and it stopped. It is in the report of the committee. Even the annexes of IGG report were annexed. But the Muhlbauer contract will end in 2014. That is, to supply the equipment, to provide the blank ID cards and to train our staff to manage the processes. If we do not fulfill those between now and 2014, that is when we can begin to count serious losses.

Why don’t you include the President in the recommendations? 

I leave that to the chairman of the committee. But we do not think it is necessary or relevant in what we are trying to do. The responsibility was assigned to us; you should make us responsible, and we have been explaining what we have been doing all along, and I hope to your satisfaction.

The inter-ministerial committee never worked so they should refund; but all these processes - the feasibility study which the Auditor General says is non-existent. Again I think we should push all these issues to the investigative machinery to find out whether these things were done or not before we begin hanging people. But let us allow the process first. 

Why take haste for the general elections in this procurement process? 

I think hon. Onek, my senior colleague, did explain that the procurement was included in phase one of the project, which included cleaning up the voters’ register for the 2011 elections. This was April, time was running out, and we needed to move fast in order to have the integrity and success of the elections in 2011. That is why this procurement was made in a rush.

Was it a turn-key project? 
No; the others may have provided a turn-key project, Face Technology, Contec Global and others, but that is the process the IGG stopped, which the committee reported on.

I think that also answers the question of the honourable Leader of the Opposition, “Why insist on Muhlbauer when there were more?” Yes, there were more, but they were stopped by the IGG investigation.  

ESO’s due diligence; actually in the report of the committee they only attached the forwarding letter, which was signed by the Director General of ESO; they didn’t attach the main body of the report. But for the purposes of what we are discussing now, ESO observed that there were weaknesses and somebody asked what these weaknesses were. 

The weaknesses didn’t have anything to do with the competence of Muhlbauer, but with some of the personnel of Muhlbauer. Again it wasn’t for us to verify. What we were interested in was a general observation of the ESO report, which said they had no problem and did not believe that this company couldn’t deliver so we went ahead.

In addition, ESO is one of our investigative arms of Government, to give us all the necessary intelligence reports and we must rely on them for the integrity of their report. 

Why depend on ministry staff in the feasibility study? Sometimes here in this House, we ask that, “We have a developed capacity, why hire consultants?” Now here we are using our staff in conjunction with Japanese experts and you are again questioning us, what does this House want? What does this country want?  We are saving money by using competent technical staff teaming up with Japanese to do the feasibility study. 

Tickets for the trip to Germany; each party sponsored their own groups. The Ministry of Internal Affairs paid for their staff; the honourable Members of Parliament who went were paid for by Parliament, and others by ICT, etcetera. Those can be found out. 

Four hundred identity cards were issued during the pilot and the target was MPs. What criteria were used? I remember very well, the team came here; they were at the conference place, and Members of Parliament were asked to go and register themselves. Those who were very keen and interested went and registered and got their cards. Unfortunately for some of them, the information wasn’t quite correct. But what you put in the computer is what comes out. If you gave your residence as Kampala, that is what came out, and that is what happened. But certainly, an announcement was made, notices were put up for those who wanted to get their IDs, and the team was here for almost two weeks in the conference hall and those who went there were registered and got their cards. There was no discrimination in the issuance of the cards.
 
Hon. Mulindwa asked, “Has Government provided money for the second phase?” Hon. Onek has given the general outline of the requirement under the second phase - 87 billion; but in the budget which was read by the Minister of Finance, we have been allocated 25 billion. We will try to see what we can do with the 25 billion out of the 87 we had requested for. 

When did the project become classified? How come a classified project is handed over to a civilian authority like the EC to produce? The component of the EC is just to clean up the register and get a clean voters’ register. 

What is classified? It is the entire process or production. What is classified is the software; what is classified is the identification of citizenship of this country, who is a Ugandan and who is not, and this is the process we must take charge of, and that is why it was classified. 

Some people say these cards can be made from Nasser Road. But when you go to Nasser Road do they take your finger prints? Do they take your photograph and IDs and all this? This is where the classified nature of this project is concerned. It is not the cameras; it is not the cards themselves. Look at the way money is printed; money is everywhere in the public domain for purchases but the process of printing is classified. You do not know how money is printed, but it is available everywhere.  That is the same thing with the ID.
 
Hon. Baryomunsi, we are sorry that the honourable minister didn’t sign the report to confirm that he is the one who has issued it, but you could see that he was physically here to present it as his report. What more evidence do you need than that?   

Are we going to pay for the IDs? The Minister of Finance said some people should actually pay for their IDs like you, honourable members. You can afford it. Some of you got them free of charge, but you can afford them.  Certainly, in our scheme of work we hope that those who can pay should pay, but the majority of our rural people should get these cards free of charge, and this is something we are working on with the Ministry of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mudimi, you quoted the letter of 20 March 2010, where PPDA was invited, and then you also quoted the letter of November, 2011, still requesting for procurement, which is which? After the meeting of 15th March for the procurement of the ID equipment and so forth, there were some more subsequent requests for procurement. I will give you one example. When the equipment arrived, we negotiated with Uganda Printing and Publishing Corporation to store the equipment in Entebbe, but we needed to enter into contract with them to refurbish that place and we, therefore, needed clearance. When we wrote to PPDA it said, “No, you people already said your procurement is classified, you go the way you want.” That is the origin of that thing. So, subsequent requests to PPDA on various procurements were still referred to as “classified” and told us to continue the way we started. 

Why isn’t the project under the Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control and why is it under the Ministry of Internal Affairs? This directorate is under us; it is under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. It is just a directorate like other directorates. 

Finally, the issue of not being categorical on whether persons mentioned in the report are in breach of the procurement law. Why aren’t we firm on the decision to take in our submission?  We think this is a matter which requires further investigation and that is why we made in the observations that the competent professional organs of the state undertake this investigation to establish the culpability of these persons and I don’t think that is asking too much. I thank you, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable minister, do you have some responses or should I take the Members through the recommendations?

6.38
THE MINISTER OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr Hillary Onek): Mr Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for answering most of the questions. Somebody raised information that there is someone who took Muhlbaeur to court for $4million commission, which they should have got. We have picked interest in that and we want to know who that is, because these are the sharks that are derailing most of our government projects. Karuma is also under fire by those kinds of sharks. Commission agents are fighting to throw the spanner in the wax if they are not favoured and, therefore, it creates all these problems. So, we would be interested to know what is happening in that area. Whoever has got information should help us.

Finally, the plan for these national IDS was intended to be a continuous process. Once the equipment was already acquired, which took the bulk of the cost, operationalising it should continue indefinitely because people are born and people are dying and this data has to be captured regularly so that at the appropriate time you know how many people will be 18 years old and so forth, so that our data will be up to date all the time and we do not have to get a contractor every year like in the case of Congo Brazzaville where everything is being printed in Germany. So, I think I have finished making my case. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, we have reached a stage where we need to see how to move forward. I think the House can agree on some of these recommendations without even further debate. But we can only tell that when we reach there. Agreed?

HONOURABLE MEMBERS: Yes.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: So, can we go to page 11 - omnibus? No. Let us see page 11. I will ask the clerk to read the three recommendations on that particular heading. We go one by one.

Recommendation A: Procurement for the classified supply of both goods and services should always, without exception, adhere to the PPDA regulatory framework regardless of their urgency.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, have we agreed on that?

HONOURABLE MEMBERS: Yes.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Should I put the question?

(Question put and agreed to.)

Recommendation B: In future, adequate, informative and exhaustive due diligence should always be carried out by procuring entities prior to binding Government to acquisitions of such magnitude and importance to the country.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are we agreed on this, honourable members? 

HONOURABLE MEMBERS: Yes.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I put the question.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Recommendation C: Approval of contracts should be based on technical and financial competitiveness as provided for under the PPDA.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are we agreed on this, honourable members? 

HONOURABLE MEMBERS: Yes.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I put the question.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Members, turn to page 14.

Recommendation D:: That the former Minister, hon. Ali Kirunda Kivejinja, as the overall political head of the procurement of the project should take full responsibility - political, financial and administrative - for the anomalies and losses occasioned and observed in the conduct of the procurement of the NSIS equipment.(Mr Onek rose_)

HONOURABLE MEMBERS: Aye!

MR ONEK: I know you are thirsty for blood.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I have not put the question. You are voting before the question. 

MR ONEK: Mr Speaker, our recommendation was that a thorough appropriate investigation by a competent authority be carried out. It is in our report. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can we have some order here, please. We are now going recommendation by recommendation. We have reached a recommendation that touches specifically on the former minister for internal affairs. That is what the committee has said. The minister is proposing something else and I think it is within the right of somebody else to propose. So, clarification on this? Honourable members, are we at the clarification stage again?

MR KWIZERA: Mr Speaker, the minister is referring to a report, and he knows we are handling one report, the one of the committee. So, which report is he referring to since we have one report?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable minister, the recommendation of the committee is that. What are you proposing?

MR ONEK: Mr Speaker, in our observations, on page 7, in our report –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: In your response -

MR ONEK: In our response, the observation on page 7, the report mentions breach of procurement law -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can we have order Members.

MR ONEK: We, however, need to further examine whether the breach was criminally intentioned or was inadvertent. The professional investigation organs of the state may have to take over from here. That is in our view. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, where there is consensus we can proceed. There seems to be no consensus. I am very advised in coming to this conclusion - Please honourable members, just listen to the Chair. I know the situation that could arise on the basis of some of these things. So, can we defer this particular recommendation? 

HONOURABLE MEMBERS: No!

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, where there is unanimity it is easier for the Speaker to proceed. I do not want you to force me to do something I did not intend to do. I am in charge of the proceedings and I observe the status of the House and I advise. Where there is controversy and a matter has been raised of this nature, I will advise at this moment, in order that we make progress on the rest of the recommendations, that we defer this particular issue. Is that the agreement? Can we -

MS AMONGI: Mr Speaker, I note that the issue raised was by the minister who is one person. And I note that you have raised the issue that if we proceed on the matter, I presume the issue of probably quorum would be raised. In the circumstances then, the issue of quorum would also be raised on all the other issues that we are voting on. So, if that is the matter, then we adjourn and we leave the whole report and we wait for the right quorum and we vote and we see the people who will move with the report in totality. (Applause) So, I am asking and seeking for guidance -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, it is not in the spirit of this House to block business that could have proceeded without other technical issues being raised. I repeatedly say, I am in charge of the management of the House. I know when certain things can happen and when we are not able to do certain things. 

In that respect, honourable members, we are unable to proceed with this business because we do not have quorum. House adjourned to tomorrow at 2.00 O’clock. 

(The House rose at 6.48 p.m. and adjourned until Thursday, 12 July 2012 at 2.00 p.m.)
