The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: I just want to thank the honourable members present for the commitment you have just displayed by attending the Sitting. I know it is a busy season but in spite of that, you have been able to find time to come and attend. I would have proceeded with business if the ministers were here, because I see on the Order Paper the ministers are in charge of those items. But since they are not here, I want to adjourn the House until Tuesday 27 December 2005 at 2.00 p.m. The House is adjourned.

(The House rose at 10.34 a.m. and adjourned until Tuesday, 27 December 2005 at 2.00 p.m.)
