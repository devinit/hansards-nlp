The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you to this sitting. The purpose for which this sitting was called on Friday morning is to conclude the business of supply and appropriation. That is why we are here so let us start.

MOTION THAT THE HOUSE RESOLVES ITSELF INTO A COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY FOR CONSIDERATION AND APPROVAL OF THE REVISED REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018/2019 AND THE BUDGETARY PROPOSALS FOR THE ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2019/2020

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Hon. Bahati, what did you want to say?

9.11
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr David Bahati): Mr Chairman, during the consultations and deliberations of the Committee on Budget, the committee erroneously adjusted the budget for Vote 008: Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and reallocated Shs 25,000,000,000, which is donor money. It is a budget support from donors, not our money to be reallocated. 

Therefore, we would like to propose that during the supply, we will adjust Vote 008 to restore that and on another vote so that this error is corrected.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Mr Chairperson, have you taken note of that? I think you need to do it now so that when we come to it, we do not have any situation. Would you like to be on record?

9.12
THE CHAIRPERSON, BUDGET COMMITTEE (Mr Amos Lugoloobi): Mr Chairman, we shall do the necessary adjustment both on Vote 008 and on the Road Fund to balance it out.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Thank you. What is the matter, honourable?

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I have an issue concerning - let me start with Vote 144: Uganda Police. This vote says, “Payment of domestic arrears to police Sacco.” 

I do not see how a Sacco can have domestic arrears because it lends money and keeps members’ savings. Therefore, how does it come up to have arrears of Shs 5,000,000,000? 

I am proposing that this is misclassification and this Shs 5,000,000,000 should be removed and taken to the teachers’ welfare.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, I recall the explanation was that the police, as a department, borrowed money from the Sacco to execute some of the functions that they needed to do. This is a refund to the Sacco.

However, we said the heading is wrong. Why are you calling it “domestic arrears to Sacco”? Why don’t you say something else? I do not know why they have kept that heading but that was the explanation. It is supposed to be refund to the Sacco of the money used by the police, I do not know for what purpose.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Chairman, that is now an internal arrangement. They borrowed internally so they should have got a budget on which to remove the money meant for that item and pay the Sacco. You cannot come and say, “We would like to appropriate domestic arrears for a police Sacco.” This is quite out of the line.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable minister, payment to the police Sacco. 

MR LUGOLOOBI: Mr Chairman, as you rightly put it, when Uganda Police ran short of funds they went to the police Sacco and borrowed money. They have since failed to pay so the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs thought that this was very unfair because the money belongs to the individual members of the Sacco. 

They proposed that we would suppress the budget for police to make it pay the Sacco. That is what we are doing. We could have erred in calling it “Domestic Arrears” but it is a debt to the police Sacco.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Chairman, that now makes the matter worse. First of all, any borrowings must be approved by Parliament. I think you are aware of that. You went to the bank to borrow money without parliamentary approval. If it was an internal arrangement, it should remain internal. 

What we would do is to appropriate money under police then police picks money to refund the Sacco rather than coming to say, “We should get five billion specifically for payment of arrears of a Sacco.” We do not know this Sacco as one of the entities in this country as far as a Government body is concerned.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Mr Chairperson, can you be more creative in this matter?

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: The Sacco is a private entity; it has nothing to do with police as a department.

MR LUGOLOOBI: Mr Speaker, if you look at page 51 of the report, the vote to which the money is being sent is Uganda Police. That is where we are sending money and we will effect payment. All we are indicating is that Police should pay this money to cater for this problem. 

The money is appropriated to Uganda Police because the Sacco does not have a Vote so we could not have voted money for them. We are voting this money to Uganda Police Force so there is no problem. It is just the expenditure that we are talking about.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Chairman, I think the chairperson of the committee does not understand and I need to make him understand. We do not know the Sacco. What we should do is appropriate the Shs 200 billion or Shs 1 trillion to the Police so that Police does –(Interjection)– Please listen to me. You cannot say this is a priority area yet we have given the Police a certain amount of money.

Mr Chairman, this is another way of dodging a ceiling. We have given the Police a ceiling –(Interjection) – Yes, if it is a justification then it does not come as a priority area here. It should be a block figure for the Police and the Police should pick the Shs 5 billion to pay the Sacco. It is like Parliament here. You cannot appropriate - (Interjection) - Please, you want payment of domestic arrears to the Police Sacco. If it is domestic, you should bill it under the Budget system.

MR BAHATI: Mr Chairman, it is important that we are transparent as we allocate resources. It is okay to put it under Police but the committee is going ahead to indicate that the Shs 5 billion we are giving Police is supposed to do this so that when the time for implementation reaches, they do not have the liberty to put it somewhere else. Therefore, it is for purposes of clarity and transparency. We are giving you Shs 5 billion for the Sacco.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: No, honourable members, I think there is a word that they use these days called “ring fencing”. They give you this block money, yes but it is ring fenced for that purpose. Therefore, I think there is no problem because the money is being appropriated to - Let me give you an example. If you look at Vote 597, the money is being appropriated to Kyankwanzi District Local Government but the ring fencing is, transitional grant to support St Ann High School, Watuba to complete construction of classroom block and laboratory start up. That is the description of what that money is for. It is going to the district but please remember it is for this purpose but the money is given to the district. 

Therefore, this money is not going to be given to the Sacco by Parliament. It is going to be given to the Police on its Vote but remember this particular amount of money must go for this purpose. That is all it is saying; so there is no mistake.

MR NZOGHU: Thank you, Mr Chairman. What the chairperson needs to clarify to us is the genesis of the arrears so that we understand. In principle, it is next to impossible to have a SACCO generate arrears; arrears in which context? That is what we would like to understand so that we know that we are on the same page.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: The arrears are not with the Sacco, it is the Police with the arrears. The Police owe the arrears to the Sacco. They took money from the Sacco, which they have failed to pay. It became an arrear on the accounts of the Police and so they are saying, we are going to help you with this money but remember to give it to the Sacco. Okay? I think it is clear, honourable.

MR ATIKU: Thank you, Mr Chairman. When the Chairperson of the Budget Committee was trying to explain this, he talked of suppressing the budget of Internal Affairs. It is important for him to come clear on which particular item he is suppressing. When the Police was borrowing this money from the Sacco, they must have indicated where they were going to get the money to replace it. Now that it is an arrear and we are trying to guide the institution of Police by ring fencing this money for the Sacco, I think it is important for the chairperson because tomorrow, this same report will come here as an audit query and it will be very awkward for Parliament to be the one asking questions to the institution of the Police.

Therefore, I think it is important that we come clear on the areas where the Budget Committee is saying they are suppressing part of the sector budget so that we are very clear because tomorrow, it will look ugly when we are asking the same questions regarding this item.

MR LUGOLOOBI: First of all, I would like to correct the statement that I referred to Ministry of Internal Affairs as the source of funds. I was talking about the Committee for Defence and Internal Affairs that originated this move. In that move, they proposed - if you look at page 43, Vote 144; Uganda Police - that we suppress some items. The money is coming from within. Shs 1 billion is from non-residential buildings, Shs 2 billion from non-residential buildings and another Shs 2 billion from fuel, which makes it a total of Shs 5 billion. Therefore, that is the source.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Can we proceed now, honourable members?

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Chairman, we have understood. There are two other items; Vote 130-Treasury Operations. This is about the South Sudan’s –

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Can we deal with it when we get to that Vote, please?

Development Expenditure 

Vote 001: Office of the President – 

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Chairman, there is nothing we are changing. Therefore, just read the vote number, as we have read for the districts, and read the total and then we go for Juma. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Is that agreeable? Chairperson? 

MR LUGOLOOBI: Yes, I would like to agree with hon. Nandala-Mafabi. In fact, that is the way we have been moving previously. As long as this schedule forms part of the report and it can be referred to, we can use the total and then read the votes. I think we shall be there, as long as we adopt the report.

MR BAHATI: It is Schedule B, but I would like to seek for clarification from the committee chairperson. You laid on the Table the committee report and there are schedules but you also have another schedule. I just want to be sure that we are reading the same schedule and therefore, the record will capture the schedule that is supposed to be captured.

MR LUGOLOOBI: Mr Chairperson, Schedule B would still be the same as it was presented in the report on the development budget estimates for Financial Year 2019/2020.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Okay, the proposal is that we read the votes and do the total.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Chairperson, I would like to seek for clarification. It is true that we read the vote, unless there are changes which the committee – (Interjection) – There are no changes. Are you confirming what the Government presented? Did the Committee on Budget also allocate its own monies or they are following the Government allocation?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, you are aware that this procedure we have adopted for the recurrent expenditure is actually the procedure. However, we are going to make this exception so that we can close in time for our colleagues who are in Ramadan to be in time for their prayers. In respect to that, I will adopt this procedure that has been proposed so that we can shorten the procedure and finish. Proceed.

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (PLANNING) (Mr David Bahati): Mr Speaker, I beg to move that the Bill entitled, “The Appropriation Bill, 2019” be read the second time.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is it seconded? Anyway, the Appropriation Bill needs no secondment. (Laughter) Are you speaking to this motion? It is an automatic motion. Do we need speeches on it? 

Honourable members, I propose the question that the Bill entitled, “The Appropriation Bill, 2019” be read for the second time. I now put the question that the Bill entitled, “The Appropriation Bill, 2019” be read for the second time.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE APPROPRIATION BILLS, 2019

Clause 1

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I put the question that clause one stand part of the Bill?

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 1, agreed to.

Clause 2

MR LUGOLOOBI: Mr Chairman, I propose an amendment in clause 2 after that figure 2020, I propose the following amendment. The sum of – (Interjection) - no that one is okay; the amendment I would like is in clause 3 and not on the petroleum fund.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, I put the question that clause 2 stand part of the Bill?

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 2, agreed to.

Clause 3

MR LUGOLOOBI: The amendment I propose, Mr Chairman, is after the date indicated 30 June 2020, to read, “the sum of Shs 27,957,163,419,000”.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, that is the amount we have just supplied now that causes that alteration. I put the question to that amendment?

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 3, as amended, agreed to.

Clause 4, agreed to.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable chairman, your amendment should have been in clause 2 and not clause 3. Clause 3 is the Petroleum Fund. Did you amend clause 3? Can we go back to clause 2 because we are still at committee stage? The Bills are different.

The Appropriation Bill, 2019 in clause 2 are the numbers we are supplying. In clause 3 is the treasury issue of the Petroleum Fund. Therefore, we are dealing with clause 2 only.

MR LUGOLOOBI: Mr Chairman, I had a document -

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Proceed, Mr Chairman.

MR LUGOLOOBI: Therefore, I propose that we amend clause 2 as follows; after the date indicated in that clause which is 30 June 2020 and insert the following words “the sum of Shs 27,957,163,419,000 only”.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, I put the question to that amendment?

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 2, as amended, agreed to.

Clause 4, agreed to.

Clause 5, agreed to.

The Schedule

MR LUGOLOOBI: Mr Chairman, the schedule has been amended by what we have just supplied. I beg that we adopt the figure that we have supplied by Vote for recurrent expenditure running from pages: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32 and 33. 

Therefore, all those figures have been replaced by the figures that we have just supplied with the corresponding votes therein. The total recurrent expenditure which we have supplied is Shs 10,594,173,246,000.

Now on development expenditure, the development expenditure schedule has equally been amended substantially and the figures were read out during supply; so, we adopt those figures to replace the figures in the Bill from pages 34, 35,36,37,38,39,40, 41.

The total development expenditure as supplied is Shs 17, 362,990,173,000. Therefore, when we add the recurrent and the development expenditure, we get the total appropriation, which appears at the bottom of page 41 and has been amended to now read Shs 27,957,163,419,000. I beg to move.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, that is the proposal made by the chairman to the schedule to the Bill. I put the question to that amendment.

(Question put and agreed to.)

The schedule, as amended, agreed to.

A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, “THE APPROPRIATION ACT, 2019”

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Congratulations. Honourable members, we have done it.

12.40
THE GOVERNMENT CHIEF WHIP (Ms Ruth Nankabirwa): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I thought that I should take the Floor to sincerely thank you for whipping, guiding and encouraging us to do what we are expected to do. I sincerely thank the Committee on Budget and the other members of Parliament who have been very vigilant. 

More specifically, I would like to thank the Leader of the Opposition and her entire team for keeping us and checking on us so that we produce a Budget that will benefit this country. I have witnessed the spirit of nationalism and I would like to pray that we move on with this spirit. I thank you and I would like to appreciate all of you. Thank you very much.

12.41
MR MUHAMMAD KIVUMBI MUWANGA (DP, Butambala County, Butambala): Mr Speaker, I stand in for the Leader of the Opposition. Much as the Leader of Government Business has congratulated the House, we do the same but with a heart of stone. This will be the first Budget that was passed without debate and we take note that this is unprecedented. 

Members who had opinions were not listened to and it stretched our civility to the limit. In future, the biggest room in any house is the room for improvement. In our humble view, we are capable of doing better and scaling to higher heights. We can do a better job than we have done today. I beg to move.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much. Honourable members, I share the sentiments of both the Government Chief Whip and the acting Leader of the Opposition. This has been a very abnormal year, a year - maybe I should not say more. It has been a very abnormal year in terms of processing this Budget but I thank you for the endurance and perseverance and also for agreeing that the Budget serves the bigger purpose than if we were to go through what we should have gone through because we would have had difficulties.

We all know that we never had ministerial policy statements, even a month after the deadline and I was hoping that when the Government Chief Whip got up to appreciate the members, she would have concluded with an apology and a promise to do better on the Government side. To just say thank you when Members have gone through hell – No, you did not - especially when she is dressed that way -

MS RUTH NANKABIRWA: Mr Speaker, I remember that I made two apologies during this process. I sincerely stand here to make a final apology because we were lacking, as far as the timeframes were concerned and we promise to do better. 

I also note that the induction that we undergo when we have just come here is not enough. I pray that in between the five years, we have a refresher induction so that we save on time when we come here and also improve. By ‘we’ I mean all members of Parliament, including my Cabinet ministers because if one arm does not do what they are expected to do, we make the other arm, which is the legislative arm, not to perform. 

I sincerely apologise on behalf of my team. I thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Honourable members, we had said we would be able to finalise with the business today but I have just received notification from Madam Speaker that we could sit on Wednesday for a short time. There are some matters that need to be handled and I just got this communication from here. 

Therefore, I will not be able to fulfil the other promise because now the bigger thing has set in - (Laughter) - I will hold this promise for another day.

Government Chief Whip, I have seen a document from you.

12.46
THE GOVERNMENT CHIEF WHIP (Ms Ruth Nankabirwa): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I beg the indulgence of the House that I am allowed to move a motion to request this august House to allow me nominate the backbench members to the Commission of this Parliament. I am doing this under rule 11 (4) of the Rules of Procedure of the Parliament of Uganda.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I did not know about this before. That could mean I have to alter the Order Paper to accommodate this particular item. If it is requested this way and we concur, I alter the Order Paper to accommodate it assuming that my friends from the opposition side are ready. Are you ready?[HON. MEMBERS: “Yes.”]The Order Paper is accordingly amended. Clerk, can you call the item?

ELECTION OF MEMBERS TO THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSION

12.48
THE GOVERNMENT CHIEF WHIP (Ms Ruth Nankabirwa): Mr Speaker and dear colleagues, in line with rule 11 (4) of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament of Uganda, as amended and on behalf of the Government side, I beg to nominate the following as backbench commissioners of Parliament for election:

    1. Hon. Peter Ogwang – NRM, Usuk County, Katakwi.
    2. Hon. Robinah Nabbanja – NRM, Woman Representative, Kakumiro
    3. Hon. Arinaitwe Rwakajara – NRM, Workers.

I beg to nominate. (Applause)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are those all the nominations from the Government side?


MS RUTH NANKABIRWA: Mr Speaker, these are the nominated members from the Central Executive Committee of the National Resistance Movement (NRM) Party. Only three names were nominated.

12.49
MR HAROLD MUHINDO (FDC, Bukonzo County East, Kasese): Thank you, Mr Speaker. In line with rule 11 of the Rules of Procedure of the Parliament of Uganda, I hereby nominate hon. Francis Mwijukye as a commissioner. I beg to nominate. (Applause)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Do you have only one nomination?

MR MUHINDO: Yes.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Guidance? I suppose that is a point of procedure.

MR ODONGA OTTO: Yes. Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence. We passed the rules yesterday and I was here - I do not see the Chairperson of the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline.

The mischief we were curing yesterday when passing the rules is the very thing taking place now. We wanted to avoid a situation where some people seated somewhere, could nominate a specific person and then prevent Parliament from exercising its right of an election. For example, I am being discriminated on. I have given notice to the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) that I am leaving the party; so, who will nominate me to be a commissioner? (Laughter)

I need an opportunity for this House to have me elected if I can find other means of nomination. It is the same with the NRM; they have just nominated three people. Supposing the House does not want them?

The guidance I am seeking is that this House should elect its commissioners. For the purpose of election, the number of people nominated should be more than the available positions. What is happening now is fraud.

I do not speak for the NRM but for my case, where no one can nominate me from anywhere, at which point will I be ready to be voted for in the House? I have a lot of voters in this House. I seek your guidance.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the general rule that governs elections is that if at the closure of elections – even in the Parliamentary elections – if you are nominated alone and nominations are closed, it is still an election. You are declared elected unopposed. (Applause)

In this case, the procedure that we have adopted, which we passed yesterday is to the effect of rule 11 (4); 
“Nomination of the candidates for the election to the commission of the four members of Parliament referred to in 1 (f) shall be made by the Government and the Opposition sides.” That is the rule we approved yesterday. That has just been done.

Honourable members, there are no more nominations from the Government and from the Opposition. Therefore, in the absence of these, I declare those Members elected unopposed. (Applause) House adjourned to Wednesday, 2 O’clock.

(The House rose at 12.53 p.m. and adjourned until Wednesday, 29 May 2019 at 2.00 p.m.)
