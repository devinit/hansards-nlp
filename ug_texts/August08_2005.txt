COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I want to welcome you back from the weekend. I also want to welcome the ministers who were able to represent us at the burial of the late Lt Gen. John Garang. Welcome back and thank you for representing us.

MR ABDU KATUNTU (Bugweri County, Iganga): I thank you very much. Mr Speaker and honourable colleagues, with deep sorrow I wish to inform you and the country that Dr John Mickloth Magoola Luwuliza Kirunda, the former Minister of Internal Affairs of Uganda died this morning in Gweru, Zimbabwe. Arrangements for his funeral will be communicated to this House, since he was a member, and also to the country later on.

THE SPEAKER: Sorry about that. May we observe a minute of silence?  

(The Members stood and observed a minute of silence.)

BILLS
COMMITTEE STAGE

THE CONSTITUTION 
(AMENDMENT NO.3) BILL, 2005

3.28
THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, we stopped at clause 23, which deals with public officers who may want to stand as candidates for parliamentary elections.

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, we consulted on this particular clause and have come up with this formulation: “Under the Multi-party political system, a public officer or a person employed in any government department or agency of the Government or an employee of the local government or a body in which the Government has control or interest, who wishes to stand for an election as a Member of Parliament shall resign his or her office three months before nomination day.”

DR MAKUBUYA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. The Chairman of the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee has reported correctly. We consulted and agreed on that formulation but may I persuade him to replace “three months” with “at least 90 days”?

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, in the spirit of a win-win situation, I accept the –(Laughter) 

THE CHAIRMAN: Then honourable members, let us vote on the amendment, by roll call.

MS NAMUSOKE: Mr Chairman, I am seeking clarification. Is it the assumption that the Electoral Commission will always announce the election or nomination day three months before the date of nomination? 

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, I would like to thank hon. Namusoke Kiyingi for posing this question. However, I think that there is no assumption. Once this becomes part of the Constitution, the Electoral Commission has to make its arrangements pursuant to this provision.  

MS NAMUSOKE: Mr Chairman, I do not want to pursue an issue, which is seemingly straight forward but we know that in the past the Electoral Commission has always said, “Look, we cannot hold such and such an election because we do not have money. Government has not provided the money and they are saying, ‘we are still looking for the money’.” Therefore, if we fix this matter in this way and later government fails to provide the money and that gap of 90 days cannot be provided for by the Electoral Commission, what do we do? I am simply seeking the assurance that everything will move in the way that we are predicting it to move. 

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, after we have handled this Constitution amendment process we shall move to make laws that operationalise the provisions of the Constitution. Therefore, the law we shall make for the Electoral Commission and the parliamentary elections will take care of a situation of this nature and ensure that the Electoral Commission follows.

MR MWONDHA: Mr Chairman, arising from your observation I wonder what is so critical about this matter? Why can we not leave it to the legislation when the time comes? It would be easier in any eventuality for us to deal with our own legislation rather than the Constitution. I foresee a situation where one will be talking about Multi-party elections and he or she also has to take into account the fact that nominations or preliminaries will be held in three months. This may not be practical because how will I know that I have been nominated by my party in order to go for nominations by the Electoral Commission?

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, I believe that you have guided the House well and that when we have passed these provisions, there will be an implementation stage through legislation. I also expect that under a Multi-party dispensation the law will indicate a timetable, which the parties will comply with. Therefore, the same answer applies to the concern raised by hon. Mwondha. Again the law will indicate a timetable and I think it is only fair to expect that this will be the case.

DR ALEX OKOT: Mr Chairman, I assume that if the “at least 90 days” is passed it will also apply to by-elections. Does this mean that by-elections will take place at least 90 days after a seat is vacant to give chance to anybody, say a civil servant or someone in the local government, to resign and therefore become a candidate?

MR KAGIMU: Mr Chairman, I am seeking another clarification. What happens if you resign and then your party does not nominate you? How do –(Laughter)

THE CHAIRMAN: In that case you would stand as an independent candidate.

MR AWORI: Mr Chairman, I am seeking further clarification from the Attorney-General as to whether the first part of the clause under the Multi-party political system is it not redundant? I think it should state that, “A public officer or a member of a commission, authority or a committee established by the Constitution who wishes to stand for election ….” Must it be attached to a particular political system? I thought it should be standard and applicable to any political system. Why are you attaching it to a specific political system?

MR OULANYAH: Thank you, Mr Chairman. As regards the issue raised by hon. Awori, if you look at clause 23 you will find that it has many parts and if you look at the proposed sub-clause (3) you will find that it is written, “Under the Movement Political System, a person elected to Parliament while he or she … shall resign upon assuming office.” This is to create a special situation under the Multi-party system by looking at both situations. This particular clause, which we have discussed many times, is the one that refers to a Multi-party system. The previous one refers to the Movement political system.

MR AWORI: In that case if you want to make sure that it is applicable in all situations, why don’t we extend it to include other institutions like religious ones to avoid situations where a leader of a particular Church organization may want to use his or her office to advance his or her candidature?

THE CHAIRMAN: Is there any further clarification you want to make? Dr Alex Okot, sorry we have not dealt with your point of clarification. He would like to know what would happen suppose somebody wants to participate in by-elections?

MR MWESIGE: Mr chairman, I think hon. Okot has a point. Should this provision be passed, a public officer will be required to resign within 90 days. Therefore, we might need a consequential amendment in Article 81(2) to fix the days within which a by-election must be held after the vacancy exists in Parliament, to 60 days. However, I think we need to do further drafting and extend the 60 days to perhaps more than 90 days.

MR WACHA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I was thinking to myself and wondering whether we have a similar provision in respect to elections for the presidency? I do not recollect that we made such a provision for a person to resign his office if he wants to stand for the presidency.

THE CHAIRMAN: I think that we should deal with the issue of the parliamentary elections, as we think about this and then we shall revert to it should the need arise. However, I think we need to deal with Dr Okot’s query.

MAJ. KINOBE: Thank you, Mr Chairman. We had discussed this in our committee sitting. I do not know how it escaped the record. We had proposed that instead of saying, “a Member of Parliament” we should say, “anybody seeking an elective political office” so that it includes all those who want to stand for elections and not necessarily Members of Parliament alone. 

MR MWESIGE: Mr Chairman, the clause that is currently being amended relates specifically to Parliament. Therefore, I do not think this is the right place to put that proposal. 

MR OULANYAH: Thank you, Mr Chairman. In light of the concern raised by Dr Okot, which is a very valid one, I am proposing that instead of 90 days we put 60 days, to be consistent with Article 81(2).

THE CHAIRMAN: I am afraid even that one may not save the situation because Article 81 says, “Wherever a vacancy exists in Parliament, the Clerk to Parliament shall notify the Electoral Commission in writing within ten days after the vacancy has occurred and a by-election shall be held within 60 days after the vacancy has occurred.” This means that if you have a maximum of ten days within 60 days, the by-election will already have taken place and therefore that cannot be a solution.

MR BANYENZAKI: Mr Chairman, by-elections are always held in special circumstances. Therefore, can’t we have a special provision and not subject by-elections to the 90 days?

THE CHAIRMAN: How about if we say that only those who qualify without hurdles will participate in a by-election?

MR KAGIMU: Mr Chairman, that is why I agreed with hon. Mwondha who said that we should leave the issue of this period for the Parliamentary Act and not put it in the Constitution.

THE CHAIRMAN: No, we have to be consistent. If we have put it in the Constitution then we should, unless of course we are silent about by-elections intentionally.

DR EPETAIT: Mr Chairman, I see no conflict at all. If a person seeks to be elected as a Member of Parliament, he should resign 90 days before nomination. In Article 81 the period within which the Electoral Commission will conduct a by-election has been specified; that is ten days of notice plus another 60 days, which adds up to about 70 days. The remaining 20 days are enough for an individual to get himself sorted out and make a decision. I really think that even if we left 81(2) as it is it would not have any effect on the earlier proposal. Therefore, I propose that we vote on the clause.

THE CHAIRMAN: Whereas you may know when a general election is going to take place, you cannot know when there will be a by-election. It can come six months after a general election or during the fourth year. Therefore, you cannot be certain as to when to make up your mind to participate in those elections. How about we leave it? 

MS NAMUSOKE: Mr Chairman, I have an amendment. I propose that the minister’s amendment be deleted and we stick to the one that he had introduced earlier in the Bill that talks about the nomination day, to avoid all these kinds of arrangements. This will ensure that once the nomination day is announced, whoever wants to stand can register, resign and then present their resignation to the Electoral Commission. I thank you.

MR AWORI: Mr Chairman, belated as it is and given the discussion on the Floor, are we not over loading the Constitution with secondary legislation again? This law really belongs to the Parliamentary Electoral Act. Therefore, to insert such electoral details in a Constitution is to overload it. These concerns could have been taken care of under Parliamentary Electoral Act.

THE CHAIRMAN: But you will also appreciate that this may result in a disqualification. If you have not resigned within the prescribed time you may be disqualified and a disqualification is a very important issue that has to be catered for.

MRS MASIKO: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. I think this is a very simple issue since a by-election is a special occurrence under special circumstances. We could insert a sentence to say, “Notwithstanding Clause … a by-election will be held …”, and we continue with the rest of the clause as it is in Article 81(2). I think that would cover our worries and by-elections would not have to wait for the 90 days.

MR WACHA: We would have a way out if we restricted this amendment to general elections and then made a specific provision in respect of by-elections allowing a person who wants to stand for a by-election to resign from his office at least seven days after the declaration of the vacancy. That would not tamper too much with the Constitution, and it would read like as follows: “Under a Multi-party political system, a public officer or member of a commission, authority or committee established by the Constitution who wishes to stand at a general election as a Member of Parliament ….” Then we would handle 81 and provide for a new law to follow this except that the candidate would still have to resign at least seven days after the declaration of a vacancy.

THE CHAIRMAN: Are there any considerations or contributions towards that particular proposal? 

MR WANDERA: Thank you very much. Mr Chairman, a by-election is an election and we cannot create two standards for the same exercise. If I am required to resign three months before a general election and another civil servant is given an opportunity of only seven days, it becomes unfair yet the Constitution requires that people be accorded similar circumstances. Because of this I propose as advised by hon. Mwondha that we deal with this issue in the elections law. Otherwise we are going to have a Constitution that is –(Interruption)

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Mr Chairman, I want to clarify to my brother hon. Wandera that we are talking of different things. A by-election under special circumstances is in most cases anticipated whereas in the case of general elections the time frame is stipulated and known. That is why we want to provide for it. We are not setting a different standard for the same things. Rather these are different values.

MR WANDERA: Mr Chairman, would it be proper to for example lower the qualifications during a by-election? It is the same thing.

THE CHAIRMAN: Well, let us deal with this clause as we think of what to do.  

MR WACHA: Mr Chairman I made a proposal but nobody has indicated whether they have accepted it or not. The frontbenchers are just looking on.

MS NAMUSOKE: Mr Chairman, I also proposed a deletion but the minister did not say whether he supported it or not except for hon. Kikungwe who supported my - therefore, I do not know whether my amendment is what we are going to vote on or not. Thank you.

MR KATUNTU: Mr Chairman, I want to know what this roll call is all about. Is it about hon. Kiyingi’s amendment or hon. Wacha’s amendment? This is because some people came late and we need to know before we can vote on the clause.  

THE CHAIRMAN: Hon. Wacha was dealing with the issue of a by-election, which I think we can ponder on as we proceed since it was another issue all together and you can also think about the best way to handle the other issue, which was raised by Dr Okot. What we are dealing with now is general elections. 

MR KATUNTU: Mr Chairman, I have a problem. If we go ahead and vote on the clause and make a decision before we harmonize this particular position with that of hon. Okot, I fear we shall have a problem within the Constitution. I would rather, since we are not hurrying for anything, that we harmonize the position and then vote on it. We cannot have contradictory positions within the Constitution.

THE CHAIRMAN: There is no contradiction if we consider this for a while and think about the best way to handle it. Dr Okot was saying we are putting different standards since civil servants have to resign within ten days while Members of Parliament can resign within 90 days. I think this requires some time to think.  

MR KATUNTU: Mr Chairman, I suggest and implore the Attorney-General together with the committee to sit and have this issue harmonized with that of the by-election. We do not have to hurry. I do not know why some colleagues are in a hurry to vote over this. We are making a Constitution and we cannot afford to have gaps in it. I pray that we harmonize this position before taking a decision.  

MR WACHA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. We have had consultations with the Attorney-General and his deputy on this matter and we have agreed that this particular sub-clause be recast in this manner: “Under the Multiparty Political System, a public officer or a member of a commission, authority or committee established by the Constitution who wishes to stand at a general election as a Member of Parliament shall resign his or her office three months before nomination day”. We have specified “general election” because later on we intend to make a slight amendment under 81 to make provisions for those who want to stand for by-elections. I beg to move.

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, I agree that in principle this provision should be restricted to a general election.

MR OULANYAH: In which case the formulation that I read earlier should be the one we retain. This is because what hon. Wacha is reading is from the amendment previously proposed by the Government. Therefore, it would now read as follows: “Under the Multi-party political system, a public officer or a person employed in any government department or agency of the Government or an employee of a Local Government or any organisation in which the Government has control or interest who wishes to stand in a general election as a Member of Parliament shall resign his or her office, at least 90 days before nomination day.”

ABSTENTIONS:
1. NAMUSOKE KIYINGI SARAH 

MR MWONDHA: Mr Chairman, I was wondering whether I could make one small observation while the tallying is going on? It looks like by this amendment we have ruled out public officers in the next general elections because they need to give three months notice before they resign; they must resign three months before nomination. This is August; we are holding elections in March, which means that they are technically out. I just thought I would put this on record.

THE CHAIRMAN: Your concern has been noted. Honourable members, the results of the voting on clause 23 standing part of the Bill are: one abstention, one against, and those for are 138. The ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 24

MRS BYAMUKAMA: I beg to move an amendment to clause 23 by inserting a new sub-article under Article 80(2). Mr Chairman, the proposed sub-article will be numbered (h) and for clarity let me refresh Members of Parliament what clause 80 is about. Clause 80 is on qualifications and disqualifications of Members of Parliament, and clause 80(2) to which I want to add (h) provides that: “A person is not qualified for election as a Member of Parliament if that person – what I would like to move is that - “if that person has within seven years preceding an election been disqualified for election as Member of Parliament by the Electoral Commission for any electoral malpractice under paragraph (f) of clause (1) of Article 61 of the Constitution.”  

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, I just have a procedural problem that there was this amendment on clause 23 and by voting as we have done we have adopted clause 23 in the Bill and, therefore, there will be a time to revisit. This cannot be the right time to introduce it when we have just voted on the clause.

MRS BYAMUKAMA: Mr Chairman, this is a new clause, and what the Attorney-General says makes sense but it would make better sense if we were recommitting the whole clause. So this is a new clause, which we would like to add to this particular article.

THE CHAIRMAN: Is it clause 23 or clause 24? What is it?

MRS BYAMUKAMA: Mr Chairman –(Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN: It could be that you might have overlooked something in the clause, which we have passed. The best way to handle this, if you have that conviction, is after we have gone through, you recommit a particular clause to refine it; I think that we can do.

MRS BYAMUKAMA: Mr Chairman, I have heard what you have advised but this is not refining.  This is a substantive Article, which will be under clause 23(b) and under clause 23(b) we are proposing an (h).

THE CHAIRMAN: No, we shall deal with it. Anyway, if you have it let us follow the procedure because clause 23 did not have this and we have adopted it. Actually it was stood over. We refined it and then we voted on it but we shall be able to take your case afterwards, please.

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, I propose that we delete the provision under clause 24 and replace it with an amendment to Article 81 of the Constitution. Article 81 of the Constitution is amended by deleting clause 81 thereof, the reason is that what is provided for in clause 24 is a repetition of what we have already provided in clause 18 and, therefore, it is redundant. I beg to move. 

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, I agree with the Attorney-General that the proposal in clause 24 would be properly taken care of by the vote that has been taken in clause 18. However, in view of the discussion that was held and adoption of clause 23, there was a proposal that the situation of a by-election should be taken care of at this stage. I am proposing that this would be an appropriate time for me to propose an addition to the proposed amendment by the minister to insert a new clause to the Constitution, which will handle the situation of by-elections in a Multi-party political system. 

As hon. Ben Wacha has stated this would be a new clause under Article 81 and I beg to propose it to be in the following terms: “Under a Multi-party political system, a public officer or a person employed in any government department or agency or the Government or an employee of a local government or anybody in which the Government has controlling interest who wishes to stand in a by-election as a Member of Parliament shall resign his or her office 30 days after the vacancy has occurred.” 

THE CHAIRMAN: Yes, but the process of somebody resigning - you are not saying, “takes leave”, but it is a process of resigning. This is considering a matter and making a decision to resign. Is it so simple that within 30 days you really resign? Previously in the laws we had one would take leave, which is okay, but you are talking about somebody resigning within 30 days because there is a by-election! Why don’t you leave out the public officers for by-elections? It is not very simple to take that decision. 

MRS MASIKO: Mr Chairperson, those who will be able to make quick decisions should be allowed to do so, because the Electoral Commission has only 60 days to organise a by-election. So you are saying that the period should be extended to give the slow thinkers time to decide whether to participate or not. Then I would support the amendment that we give even the civil servants a chance of 30 days to make up their mind whether to contest or not. Really, being involved in politics is not a gamble. They should be able to decide whether they are to stay in their public offices or to come into politics. I beg to support the amendment.

THE CHAIRMAN: It is not my intention to participate in the debate but there is a difference between the general election and a by-election. In the general election you will know that in five years’ time after the elections have taken place there will be an election. You can discuss this, you can think about it because with resigning, it is not only you the person who is resigning, but it affects your family. Therefore, this is not something –(Interjections)- yes, this is not something you take lightly. Well, it is up to you. 

MR KASSIANO: Mr Chairman, I do agree with you that 30 days is not long enough especially from the point of view of our civil servants to make that important decision. It is not even a matter of a decision but even the fact that the bureaucratic system in the civil service does not allow it, should be considered. By the time a civil servant makes up his or her mind to pen his resignation and by the time an answer is given to it; my 20 years in the civil service tell me that within 30 days’ time that civil servant will not even have got a feedback from the Ministry of Public Service. 

I, therefore, wish to say that it is not enough for the civil servant to show his intention by writing his resignation letter. What they will require and what they will consider is the acceptance by the appointing authority, which in this case is the Public Service Commission. Therefore, 30 days are certainly not long enough for a civil servant to successfully tender in his resignation to be in time for any by-elections. I, therefore, propose that we equate it to the clause we have just approved and zero it down to at least 90 days so that the civil servant can make up his mind and also give enough time for the system to consider his application. Thank you. 

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. Whichever way you look at it, when you vacate an office to go for politics, you take a risk. It is a risk because some of us who have resigned and joined politics, the probability that you are not elected is 50 percent. We have a situation where what we did not anticipate happens for instance death or disqualification because of academic papers or criminal act. For you to say you want to stand without taking a risk is a dream! You must resign your office as per the constitutional provision, or stay away from politics. 

Our responsibility is to provide for those who are ready to take risks. Otherwise, we shall not allow a constituency to go without a Member of Parliament for 90 days to allow the Rwamiramas of this world to take a decision. Therefore, I support that we give ten days’ notice of resignation, if they do not show us –(Interruption) 

MR MIKE SEBALU: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I too support that when we get new people coming up, they must be very serious. We have had so many people, not serious, who are just out to try everything. We must have very serious people who are ready to respond at short notice. However, there is a provision so that at the end of the day people will not say that they are left out. We should give an outlet so that people try their luck, within limits of seriousness.

THE CHAIRMAN: Why don’t you forget about them during the by-election? 

MS ALASO: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. It is in the interest of this House that we get people of quality and commitment to come in after a by-election. It is not easy to process a resignation. People will not just walk away like that without going through the proper procedures of resignation. Yet even unpaid leave is sometimes very hard to get in the civil service. So if we are not just making this provision to make it difficult for people to get in, then we should have unpaid leave as an alternative. If leave can be sanctioned for one month then my immediate supervisor can authorise that but not the resignation in less than a month’s time.

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Mr Chairman, I want hon. Alaso to make this clear to us. We have already gone into the Multi-party system and civil servants are not supposed to be partisan. When an individual takes leave and joins DP, what happens when they fail?  Do they come back to office when they have already taken political sides? 
  
MR KABAREEBE: Mr Chairman, taking leave is more difficult because you should be authorised to do so. However, when one resigns and the process does not warrant leave, then that means – because it happened to me. I asked for leave and my boss refused; he had to wait for a full council to sit and give me leave. I had to go to court to swear an affidavit in order to beat the set deadline. As you can see, people should come into politics prepared for every eventuality. If one is not prepared then they should not venture! (Laughter) Thank you very much.

MAJ. (RTD) KINOBE: Thank you, Mr Chairman. We still have a problem of the hangover of individual merit. One of the strong arguments that were used for Multi-partism is that it even prepares leaders. My opinion is, by the time you get to a by-election all the parties that participated in the election will have reserve members within the party who are ready to offer themselves as candidates. 

The only complication will come for the independent candidates. If you choose to stand as an independent candidate, for heaven’s sake be ready for the risks of standing alone. However, if you are a party candidate, you will already be a member of that party, having already resigned from public service. Therefore, if the by-election is between parties they will be ready to offer a candidate even if it means one week. I support the proposal.

MRS SSENTONGO: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. As a Workers’ Representative, I must be concerned about this subject. We should know that politics is a game for everyone. If we put such stringent conditions for our own children, we are denying them the right to fully participate. We need successors when we go away. I support hon. Alaso’s idea of allowing public officers to get unpaid leave for a number of days so that they could equally have an opportunity to participate and at the same time not lose employment should things go wrong -(Interruption) 

MR MULENGANI: My colleague is mixing up issues, Mr Chairman. We are aware that the rules of the game of Multi-party politics bar public and civil servants from showing their interest in politics. For as long as one pulls out to participate even in the by-elections, they have already shown that they have a belonging in politics. Is my colleague, therefore, in order to imply that being partisan in politics has no problem? If you have interest in participating you should resign before you get into this risky venture. Is she in order?

THE CHAIRMAN: I think she was prompted to say what she said because she does not think that the offer you are making for purposes of by-election is realistic. It is a genuine assessment of the situation. She is not suggesting a token offer, where public officers are free to be partisan.  

MRS SSENTONGO: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman for your wise ruling. My colleague got me wrong but the idea is, let us groom these young ones to come up. We should not put strict rules, which will be impracticable, please.  

THE CHAIRMAN: Why don’t we end this and vote?

MS NAMUSOKE: Mr Chairman, I seek clarification in view of what hon. Wadri said. When does the count down of these days begin? Is at the time when the civil servant writes the letter or when the civil service accepts their resignation? You are subjecting these people to a process, which they have no control of. You are saying we want you to resign but then the public service system may not work as fast as the days you have given. So when does the count down begin for these civil servants?

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Mr Chairman, I want to request honourable members not to mistake resignation for retirement. When you resign, you leave and forfeit all the benefits sometimes. Resignation is not like retirement where you apply. 
 
THE CHAIRMAN: Can we get on to the next clause?

MS ALASO: Mr Chairman, I want to seek clarification. This is a very important issue. The question of the count down is very important because the assertion made by hon. Rwamirama, presupposes that those officers who are resigning simply walk away without handing over offices or accounting for resources within their custody. Is that the position that this House would like to take?

MR KAGIMU: Mr Chairman, you had already advised the House to leave the public servants out of by-elections so that they wait for another general election. It is very simple.

MS NAMUSOKE: Mr Chairman, hon. Rwamirama thinks resignation is just abandoning one’s job. That is what he seems to suggest and I am surprised that the honourable member who is - are you retired? I am surprised that a retired soldier would suggest such a thing, because it is punishable in the Army and Police to just abandon one’s office. They would arrest you. So –(Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN: Please, honourable members, let us not waste our limited time. 

MR OULANYAH: Thank you, Mr Chairman. This has arisen because of the concerns raised by Dr Okot. This was an attempt to try to make accommodation for that situation. Again, on reading Article 81(2), which we now seek to improve on, this is going to be difficult. Article 81(2) is formulated not based on any political system and yet the clause we have just passed has specific references to the Movement political system and conditions under it. A Multi-party political system also has conditions for resignation. Article 81(2) talks about a vacancy existing and a by-election being held within 60 days, without attaching any conditions of this nature. 

On reflection - because these were matters that we were called to think about and consult quickly on - it may not be that necessary to amend 81 in the terms I had previously proposed because (2) in 81 is general to all situations. Therefore, I now consider withdrawing my earlier proposal, without costs of course. Thank you.

THE CHAIRMAN: The amendment is withdrawn. There was an amendment to delete 81(1), should we take a roll call or vote by a show of hands? We shall take the roll call to delete 81(1).

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, the first proposal by the Attorney-General is to delete the existing clause 24 in the Bill and replace it with a new clause 24. The new clause 24, if we adopt that amendment then we would go without the effect of repealing Article 81. Therefore, maybe we should first delete the original clause 24 in the Bill and replace it with a new clause 24.

THE CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that clause 24 be deleted from the original text in the Bill.  

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: The position is as follows: no abstention, none against, and those for are 96. The ayes have it.
  
(Question agreed to.)

THE CHAIRMAN: Deleting clause 24 from the Constitution requires a roll call.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 26

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, the last time we discussed clause 26 it caused a lot of controversy. Honourable members expressed serious concern over what it meant. We can go into explaining what it meant and so on, but we propose in the interest of peace that the clause be deleted. (Applause)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, I put the question for the proposed amendment by way of deletion.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position on clause 26 is: no abstentions, none against and those for are 96. The ayes have it so it is deleted. (Applause)  

(Question agreed to.)

MOTION FOR THE HOUSE TO RESUME

5.30
THE MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS/ATTORNEY GENERAL (Dr. Khiddu Makubuya): Sir, I beg to move that the House do resume so that the Committee of the Whole House can report thereto. 

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that the House do resume and the Committee of the Whole House reports thereto.

(Question put and agreed to.)

(The House resumed, the Speaker presiding_)

REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE

5.32
THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS/ATTORNEY GENERAL (Prof. Khiddu Makubuya): Mr Speaker, I beg to report that the Committee of the whole House continued with consideration of the Constitution (Amendment No.3) Bill, 2005 and took the following decisions:

It adopted clause 23 with amendment; it adopted clause 24 with amendment; and it deleted clause 26 from the Bill. Mr Speaker, I beg to report.

MOTION FOR ADOPTION OF THE REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE
 
5.33
THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS/ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Dr. Khiddu Makubuya): Mr Speaker, I therefore move that the report from the Committee of the whole House, which I have just read out, be adopted. I beg to move.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you. I put the question that the report from the Committee of the Whole House that has been read to us be adopted.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, we are to resume the House but it was not my wish to resume the House as we did. This was simply because the result of the last voting was the bare minimum because some of our colleagues, honourable members were outside although I believe they must have watched the voting. 

With the risk of now going down below the quorum, it would not have reflected well on you and I decided to resume the House. But I appeal to you all the time to be in the House because we are not dealing with regulating drinking hours, we are dealing with the Constitution and, therefore, everybody should be here in the House. Tomorrow when we resume, please I appeal to you to be in the House rather than outside. I did not want to go below 96, then 94. It is not good for our record.  

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I wondered whether this was not the opportune moment to suggest that the practice elsewhere in other Parliaments - I have seen it in the House of Commons, I have seen it in the United States and so on – although you do not give time for it, but routinely the administration of Parliament, when a vote is about to come, they go and press the bell so that those who are in the corridor or in these places can run back. Could I suggest that we adopt that practice? Just ringing the bell for people to know that voting is about to happen?

THE SPEAKER: How many times are we going to ring the bell when each clause calls for a voting? Every time we reach then the bell, it will be a disco and our rules are very clear; you ring the bell if the issue of quorum is raised and we cannot have it. But every time we call a clause, we ring the bell? I think honourable members, just sacrifice everything so that we can complete this exercise and it is my wish that we do complete this exercise this week. Most likely we shall finish Bill No.3 tomorrow then we go to Bill No.2. Maybe by Thursday we will have completed the exercise. But it has taken long.

MR NASASIRA: In addition to hon. Mbabazi – because of lack of the bell, some of us had just gone outside to appeal to members that we thought we would finish these deletion clauses today and as you will notice, people are just coming back for that. The problem is that because of roll call and tallying, when you vote like Rex Aachilla and you know there is another one hour, you will try to do something else in between and come back. I am saying, between Rex Aachilla and hon. Zziwa is about – so that is why you see people sometimes going outside. But because of lack of the bell all of us had tried to mobilize ourselves and as you saw people were coming in to vote maybe now that we are here, I do not know whether it is in your powers to finish these deletions tonight. Thank you, Mr Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Are you ready to be here for two hours?

HON. MEMBERS: Yes.

BILLS 
COMMITTEE STAGE

THE CONSTITUTION 
(AMENDMENT NO.3) BILL, 2005

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, I think there was an amendment, which we stood over. It should have been clause 33(a); this was by hon. Dr Okulo Epak. Have you internalised the amendment so that we can see how we proceed? Who is the mover?

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, you will notice that in the original Bill this clause 33(a) was not provided for. You will also notice that the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs did not make or propose any amendment to this effect. I issued this notice that this amendment would be moved. Since then I received representation and I beg to move that clause 33(a) be deleted.

THE CHAIRMAN: The proposal is to delete this amendment, which had been moved.

MR KAGIMU: Mr Chairman, first of all it is not true that the committee did not receive this amendment because I went to the committee and the chairman reported here that I wanted Article 93, especially paragraph (a), to be deleted and it was rejected. I came to the House and the chairman confirmed it. So we were allowed to move it.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, it was not adopted, it was presented to the committee and using our powers under the rules you tabled it.

MR KAGIMU: Mr Chairman, even when the Government amended it on page 6, you find that what they amended was redundant because when you leave Article 93 intact and then you come and say we amend Article 94 that, “The principles underlying the Private Members’ Bill shall before the introduction of the Bill be examined …”. It is useless when Article 93 is not amended as we suggested. We had asked that Article 93 be amended to delete clause 2.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position is this: the Bill did not have that particular clause. Some members presented it to the committee but the committee did not buy the amendment. However, under our rules the members who had submitted the amendment to the committee, which amendment was not adopted, were free to bring it here. Now they have brought it here. Subsequently, the Attorney-General has said that we delete it and apparently hon. Kagimu is saying we maintain it. So, there are two amendments here: one, which goes the farthest is that of deletion because if it is deleted there is nothing to debate. Can we start with the amendment that goes the farthest, namely, deletion? I put the question to the motion for deletion.

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position on the motion to delete amendment 33(a) is as follows: three abstentions, those against are four and those for are 108. The ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

MR KAGIMU: Mr Chairman, what you have deleted is the amendment as proposed by the Government. Now I want to move an amendment on the provision of the Constitution itself.

THE CHAIRMAN: No, honourable member, the Bill did not have this provision but during the proceedings of the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee somebody presented the case that we should include in the Constitution (Amendment) Bill this particular provision. The committee did not buy the idea and therefore it was not one of the amendments, which was submitted in the report of the committee. But under our Rules of Procedure, if you presented your amendment and it has not been taken up or owned up by the committee, you are free to come and present it to the whole House here, which was done. 

Unfortunately we were not able to dispose of that particular amendment then, therefore, the amendment was stood over for further consideration and as they did the consultation. Apparently the Government was trying to buy it somehow and that is the kind of amendment you are talking about. But when the matter came up for consideration the Government declined taking action on the amendment, which you presented and for them the motion has been that we delete the amendment, which was not bought by the committee but which was subsequently presented here. The last vote we had was to delete that particular amendment and it has been deleted and there is no amendment, which you can amend. 

Clause 34

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, clause 34 sought to introduce Article 96(a) into the Constitution and this was on resolution of disputes between the Executive and Parliament, on issues of confidence. You will recall the last time this matter was discussed here it generated a lot of controversy. We re-examined the matter and we found that the matter of referring issues deemed important by the Executive is already covered in clause 91 and, therefore, you do not need clause 34. I propose that it be deleted. 

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, this had actually been the original position of the committee. I am glad the Government has come to this position now. It should be deleted.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, let us vote on the deletion of clause 34.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)
 
THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position is as follows: no abstentions, none against and those for are 114. The ayes have it, so it is deleted. 

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 81

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, I propose that in (e) we introduce the words “within the judicial system” between “court” and “for”, on the first line so that it reads “establishing a special court within the judicial system for combating corruption …”. 

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, that proposal would be redundant because under the Judiciary powers are granted to the court to create special sections in the court to deal with the situation, which is special. We created a division in the High Court for Commercial Courts, we are about to introduce a division of human rights and there are several lobbies for people wanting special division of courts in the High Court to be created. This particular proposal will be redundant and it is unnecessary. We originally opposed it on the basis of it being special outside the Judiciary but those principles - they have not tried to have it accommodated. We still repeat that there is no need to create any special court on corruption. We oppose the amendment and we propose deletion of the clause. 

DR EPETAIT: To the best of my recollection, last time when we were going through this particular clause 83 the committee moved its amendment and indeed I was consulting with the Minister of State for Constitutional Affairs, and we agreed. We actually voted on that clause. I think the Government conceded to that particular clause. Is this a recommittal issue or otherwise we voted on it? 

MR OULANYAH: No, there were two special courts, one on terrorism whose deletion was voted for and it was deleted, but this one was deferred and this is the appropriate time to delete it. (Laughter)

THE CHAIRMAN: The position of the committee is that we delete clause 83.  

HON. MEMBERS: Yes.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, honourable members, the position of the committee is that we should delete 83. Clause 83 was included in the Bill. According to the chairperson of the committee, or the committee for that matter, its recommendation was for a deletion. As far as the owner of the Bill is concerned, there should be an amendment and insert within the jurisdiction. These are two positions: if we delete, there is nothing to amend; if the motion for deletion fails, then we can think of amending. Is it clear? The position is that as far as the committee is concerned, it is unnecessary to provide it so they propose a deletion. If we delete, then the question of improving it as suggested by the minister will not arise. Is that clear? Those in favour of deletion –(Interruption)

MR WACHA: Mr Chairman, some of us are not yet with you. Can you please repeat and clarify as to what the actual provision is? What is the impact of deleting, et cetera? Because we might be voting on things we do not understand.

THE CHAIRMAN: Would you like the chairman of the committee to state the committee’s position for the House?

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, clause 83 proposes to amend Article 232 of the Constitution to introduce a special court on corruption. The committee does not support the idea of creating any special court on corruption in the report since failure to combat corruption is not attributable to absence of the courts or structures but to unwillingness or otherwise on the part of those involved in the fight against corruption. We propose that this clause be deleted.

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, we are proposing an amendment to Article 232 of the Constitution to add (e) at the bottom of page 56 of the Bill. Article 232 is part of Chapter 13 of the Constitution and the title is “Inspectorate of Government”. When you go to Article 232(1) - let me read part of it: “Parliament shall, subject to the provisions of this Constitution, make laws to give effect to the provisions of this Chapter.”

Article 232(2); “Laws made for the purpose of this Chapter may, in particular, provide - a, b, c, d and we are proposing to add (e): “Establishing a special code for combating corruption and prescribing the composition and jurisdiction and procedures of the court and appeal from the court.” It is really hard on some of us who keep hearing that the Government is not committed to fighting corruption. We have established structures but still the problem persists. The special court as I propose, within the judicial system, is an extra mile of commitment on the part of the Government –(Applause)- that we regard corruption as a serious matter and we must recommit ourselves to fighting it.

And honourable colleagues, it is incumbent upon you as hon. Members of Parliament to join the Government in this extra mile of commitment to deal with corruption.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, this is not a general debate. We finished the general debate. This provision was in the Bill when we debated the same motion for Second Reading. This is a committee. The motion is from the committee, to delete. Of course the minister has made some sort of a reply to the proposal of the committee to delete, and he is opposing it but we have two positions: one is to maintain the position and the other is to delete. What we normally do is to vote for the motion that goes furthest and that is the committee’s position. When we do that then we shall see how to proceed and that is why I am asking you now to vote on the motion by the committee, which is seeking a deletion.  

MS AMONGI: Thank you, Mr Chairman. It would be good for the minister to clarify – he talked about structures. What mischief is the special court going to cure that the structures have failed to cure? If it is only about extra commitment, then I fail to understand, but what have the structures failed to cure that this special court is going to cure?

DR MAKUBUYA: I would like to thank honourable –(Interruption) 

THE CHAIRMAN: Get all the clarifications first so that you can answer them at once.

MS KIRASO: Thank you, Mr Chairman. Honourable minister, do courts of law go out to look for criminals and corrupt people or there are other investigative structures, which get corrupt people, wrong people in society and take them to courts of law? If you create this special court of law and the other structures, which are supposed to be hunting down corrupt people and not doing their work, what will the court do?

MR EKANYA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. Honourable minister, would you consider along the same amendment, establishing an Anti Corruption Recovery Fund, because what the world and the people of Uganda would like to hear is how much money government recovered as a result of the legal system implementing its decision. That would be very important.

Number two, what would be the implication on other courts like we have the Commercial Court and the Children’s Court, which are not provided for explicitly in the Constitution?

MR WAGONDA MUGULI: Mr Chairman, could the honourable minister demonstrate to this Parliament as to how many cases of corruption are pending, which the normal existing court structure cannot handle, so that it is not taken that his proposal is merely for propaganda, for government to appear to be doing something, when actually there is nothing being done.

MR WACHA: Thank you, Sir. Following what hon. Muguli has just stated, how can the minister assure this House that the passing of this provision will not look as if we are passing a vote of no confidence in our ordinary courts? We should desist from Amin’s way of establishing institutions, of military tribunals, which eventually was seen as if they were killing off the ordinary courts.

MR MWONDHA: Mr Chairman, I would like the minister to allay my fear that in attempting to create special courts we are not running away from the normal standard of proof as available in the present judicial system.

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. The original position was that actually the special courts, it was not very clear where they would reside and our concern was that we were creating a parallel structure that will eventually undermine the confidence of the existing courts.  

The other issue was that these courts could be used to victimize or to exonerate criminals but the way they have put it, if I got it correctly that if it is going to be established within the court and the Judiciary is the one setting these courts, I do not see why we have to argue. We are creating an institution in a proper channel. It is like the Commercial Courts are operating now. So, if that is the case, then we should adopt it.

MR MAO: Thank you, Sir. Usually when somebody has strong arguments for an idea, one does not have to shout. The level of noise of the Attorney-General made me –(Interjections)- I am simply saying that the Attorney-General does not have very strong arguments in favour of this proposal. I believe very strongly that just like this House rejected the proposal for courts on terrorism, the same circumstances apply here. The same circumstances apply because we have to strengthen our existing courts rather than set up special courts. I see no reason, unless the noise of the Attorney-General was impressive, otherwise I did not see any strong arguments.

MS ALASO: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I want to seek clarification from the Attorney-General. He has referred to Article 232 of the Constitution, which says, “Parliament shall, subject to the provisions of this Constitution, make laws to give effect to the provisions of this Chapter.”  

One, I would like to know from him, if the laws to be made to give effect to this chapter are supposed to be made right in the Constitution; and two, whether you do not perceive parts a, b, c and d as simply functions rather than structures? I get the impression that a, b, c and d give you guidance on what functions whatever other structures will be created will have to carry on. So, I want you to help me know whether it is prudent to just go on operationalising laws within the Constitution and making a structure instead of recognizing the functional provision that are here.

MR RUHINDI: Mr Chairman, there is a small problem. I do not know how to call it but may I be protected on my left? I cannot –(Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN: Please, allow the member to develop his idea.

MR RUHINDI: Mr Chairman, in the Constitution we have Article 129, which talks about the courts of judicature and it gives the hierarchy of the court structure: the Supreme Court of Uganda, the Court of Appeal of Uganda, and the High Court of Uganda. It goes on in Article 139 of the Constitution, which says; “The High Court shall, subject to the provisions of this Constitution, have unlimited or original jurisdiction in all matters and such apparent and other jurisdiction as maybe conferred on it by this Constitution or other law.”  

When we introduce this clause establishing special courts within the judicial system, at what level of the court structure is it? Is it not going to be in conflict with some of these provisions? In my opinion, like the many clauses that the hon. Attorney-General has stood over, it could be prudent to stand over this clause and harmonize it with the existing structure in the Constitution.

MR OULANYAH: Thank you, Mr Chairman. The issue that the committee did not consider at that time was that of creating it within the judiciary because that was never a matter before the committee. Creating it within the judiciary would mean having the judiciary establish this court the way they do it. So what we are saying is, under Chapter VIII the Judiciary already has a way of creating divisions that are specialized to deal with specific matters. You do not need a constitutional provision creating a special division of the High Court. I gave the example of the Commercial Division of the High Court. It is not created in the Constitution but because under the Article that hon. Ruhindi has just quoted, Article 129, the High Court has unlimited jurisdiction on all matters in this country, so it is up to them to decide if the matter is so urgent and that is what we recommended during the debate on the White Paper. If it is so necessary, then advise the Judiciary to create a special division of the High Court to deal with cases of corruption, but this would not require an amendment of the Constitution. (Applause)

PROF. KABWEGYERE: Mr Chairman, it is not all the time that a state of emergency is declared. A state of emergency is declared when the normal processes do not seem to work, then you appeal to extra powers. I would want to liken the situation we are in with that kind of situation. 

Those of us who are in certain positions in government who have to face the conditionalities surrounding funding of this project or the other, are being told all the time that corruption is a problem in developing countries, corruption is a problem affecting governments in developing countries, Uganda inclusive. Making this law can have two aspects and I have said this before: one is preventive, and the other is directional. I think in this case it is a combination of both. That of the fear of a court established by a law and the provision of a direction that we are fighting against corruption would be a strategic position to take at this point in time.  

It is okay to say that the Judiciary can do it within their present set up, but it is also not true to imagine that the Judiciary can be declared free of this same problem that we are trying to fight. Therefore, it may be that a judicial court, I mean a corruption court may even try judges; they even try magistrates. So why are we closing a possibility of a tool that we could actually use to clean our system?

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, this is an important day in the life of this Parliament. People are watching, yes, and today we are to stand up to be counted. Hon. Kiraso asked how the establishment of this court improves the systems, which have to fit into this organ or indeed other organs combating corruption. The inclusion of this provision is a major reminder to everybody that this is a priority to the Government, so handle as a matter of priority, handle efficiently and if you are part of the system, which fits into the organ you are also on test so that you are not seen to fail the system.

We can inquire into pending cases and into the speed with which they are being tried. I can look up that information and deliver it because I just learnt now that it is wanted. As I have been mentioning, it has not been mentioned to me before, but as it is mentioned now, I will give you a catalogue in due course. 

There is a very important point from hon. Ben Wacha and indeed it is the same kind of point being made by my honourable, comrade Patrick Mwondha. The point is, are you not giving a vote of no confidence to the ordinary courts? Are you not seeking to undermine ordinary stands of proof, which are required in the ordinary courts? My dear honourable colleagues, what we are saying in the proposal is that you will establish this special court for combating corruption and that law will prescribe the composition, jurisdiction, procedures and the appellant process from that forum. So we are not undermining, no.  The law will come here and Parliament will establish those standards.

There is also an important point being raised –(Interruption)

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: Thank you minister for giving way. Mr Chairman, I am seeking clarification. We want the amendment to come out clearly that these courts are going to be established within the judicial system, like the commercial courts are operating now. But the way he is bringing it up does not really stand out clearly to allay the fears of members.

DR MAKUBUYA: I would like to thank hon. Rwamirama for that intervention. At this point in time the crux of the matter is whether to delete or not to delete. I cannot go into improving this provision now until you have decided to retain it because if you do not retain it, then there is nothing to improve.

THE CHAIRMAN: I think both sides have expressed their case. It is high time we voted on the motion to delete.

MAJ. RWAMIRAMA: But for you to decide to retain or not, you must base on substance and it is very important that we do not waste time, because if you tell us what you want to cure something, how you are going to do it? We should agree to retain because if you leave it now, some people may actually say delete when they would have preferred retention.

THE CHAIRMAN: As the case has not been made by both sides, if you think there is no substance in one position, you do not support it but if you think there is substance in another position, support that position, which has substance. What do you fear in voting?

DR MAKUBUYA: I will not go into articulating this issue further. I would only like to advice my honourable colleague hon. Mao that I raised this issue in good faith and in what I think is in the best interest of Uganda. If I have raised it with noise, I apologize to hon. Mao and his constituency.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, let us vote on the motion to delete clause 83.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position on the motion to delete the clause is as follows: seven abstentions, those for are 17, and those against are 98. The noes have it.

(Question negatived.)

MR ANANG-ODUR: Amendment. Mr Chairman, I am encouraged by the seriousness with which both the Government and Parliament is now taking the matter of corruption and in that spirit of bolstering this provision, which we have just passed, I want to add (f) as an amendment in the following terms: “Provide for conviction and severe punishment of persons who protect corruption suspects and obstruct due process of the law.”  I beg to move.  

THE CHAIRMAN: Well, according to the law, when you aid somebody to commit an offence, you are a principle offender too. That is the position.   

MR ANANG-ODUR: Mr chairman, if you look at the debate, which has taken place, those against and for the motion have shown concern for the source of delays or ineffectiveness in prosecution of corruption cases, and in many other cases, which have passed. There have been accusations that certain persons have been protected by highly placed persons in our government and it is from this perspective that since we are now seeking to leave no stone unturned I feel this particular amendment can deter those who might have the intentions and have been practicing protection of criminals. This is my concern and I feel we shall wipe out this scourge if we pass this amendment.  

THE CHAIRMAN: Attorney-General you have heard the amendment.

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, the acts, which are being mentioned by hon. Anang-Odur are actually covered in the general criminal law. If hon. Mao Norbert does not shout - what he was accusing me of is exactly what he is doing. We should not have double standards, when it is me, I am shouting – the short point is that I sympathize very much with what hon. Anang-Odur is saying but my understanding is that if you are talking about abating crime and so on, then they are already provided for.  So, in my judgment I do not think you need a special amendment.

THE CHAIRMAN: I think we should take the roll call and vote on this.

DR MAKUBUYA: Sir, I could not move it then because I was not sure whether they were going to retain the clause. So I propose “within the judicial system”.

THE CHAIRMAN: So he wants to insert in the first line “within the judicial system”, that is the amendment. Let us vote on the amendment.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: The position on the amendment moved by the minister is as follows: we have one against, three abstentions and those for are 104. The amendment is carried.

(Question agreed to.)

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, as a result of a formulation that has been introduced by the honourable minister, the phrase “judicial system” is not defined in the Constitution. So if you are saying, “which will be introduced within the judicial system”, the Constitution has to have a specific definition of what a judicial system is if it is to be understood.

MR MWESIGE: Mr Chairman, I understand hon. Oulanyah’s concern. I think we could modify it by saying, “within the Judiciary” because the Judiciary is clearly stated in the Constitution, and it well known.

MR RUHINDI: I think we are going back to square one. Why? Because with the introduction of the amendment of the hon. Attorney-General the right procedure would have been not to amend Article 232 but amend Article 139. You may actually think seriously about doing that. We have voted, I know, but we have got to, as the chairperson of the committee says, first define the “judicial system”. 

Secondly, we need to define where that special court will fit in the judicial system. Otherwise, it will distort the judicial infrastructure – absolutely, it will. This is why it would have been appropriate to amend Article 139 where the High Court is established and give the High Court powers in its jurisdiction to establish such special courts, as it may deem expedient covering that particular scenario but the way it is now, it is absolutely distorting our judicial infrastructure.

MR MBABAZI: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I just want to say that I can see the point hon. Fred Ruhindi is trying to raise. However, we have a precedent when you look at Article 137 in relation to the military courts, you will see that in clause (5) of Article 137 there is a specific provision about field court martial in relation to interpretation of the law, the Constitution. And as hon. Fred Ruhindi knows and others know, we have established an administration of justice procedure within the military, which clearly is not consistent with the provisions of Article 129, which hon. Ruhindi is raising.  

So similarly, the proposition here is that in this Constitution we established the anti-corruption court and then by subsidiary legislation as we did in the Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces Act because we passed this in this same House, we provided for the procedure and so on, the jurisdiction of that court. So by creating this we are following a precedent already set in the Constitution and in subsidiary law, which we have. That is why I was saying that hon. Ruhindi Fred need not push the point because it is covered. Thank you.

THE CHAIRMAN: Are you clarifying because hon. Ruhindi raised a point?

DR MAKUBUYA: I had understood that the points hon. Ruhindi had raised had been answered by the former Attorney-General and now Minister of Defence, and I thought that you were ready to take the roll call.

THE CHAIRMAN: So let us vote on it by roll call, please.

(Question agreed to.)

MRS ZZIWA: Mr Chairman, I realize that you are about to invite the honourable minister so that we go back to the Whole House. When we were dealing with clause 8 there was an amendment, which I brought and you requested the hon. Attorney-General to look at it. He had assured me that he would consult with the Cabinet and be able to report on it and on his amendment, but it did not feature. My consultations with him earlier did not seem to produce any positive results. I wanted to find out how I will be allowed to proceed considering that my amendment was duly presented and we stood over it.

THE CHAIRMAN: Let us proceed with those that are with us and then later when we finish them we shall see what to do with your amendment. According to my list here I have two remaining clauses that were stood over, namely clause 95 and 97, and Schedule No. 3. I think that is what remained. But then after we finish that one, before we proceed we shall consider any other pending matters. What I have said covers you, hon. Lukyamuzi. (Laughter)
