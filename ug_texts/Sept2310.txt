PRAYERS

(The Speaker, Mr Edward Ssekandi, in the Chair.)

The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I welcome especially those who have been consistent in attending Parliament. It should be known that the work of Parliament has to continue despite of other personal problems you may have. The term of this Parliament will end in May next year; therefore, the public expects you to continue working until May next year. Therefore, I appeal to you, hon. Members, to try and come to do parliamentary work at least for this month and next month and towards the end of November then we can see what to do after November, otherwise the attendance is not good. 

2.54
MR JOHN LIVINGSTONE OKELLO-OKELLO (UPC, Chua County, Kitgum): Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is a difficult time for Parliament but I think we should also try to attract Members. If we bring questions – there are many questions, which are hanging and there are ministers who are anxious to answer them - they would lure people to come back, especially those which are still pending. 

THE SPEAKER: Yes, but questions must be asked by the person who filed the questions, if he is not here, how do we start? But we shall try every method to see that the element is cured. 

PRESENTATION OF PAPERS

2.56
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONONIC DEVELOPMENT (MICRO-FINANCE) (Ms Ruth Nankabirwa): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I beg to present a request for Government to borrow Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 65.9 million, which is an equivalent of US $100 million from the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank Group for the Eighth Poverty Reduction Support Credit. I beg to present. 

THE SPEAKER: Okay, let the appropriate committee examine the request and report promptly.

MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT UNDER SECTION 186(1) OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACT PROVIDING FOR EXTENSION OF THE TERM OF OFFICE OF INTERIM DISTRICT COUNCILS

2.57
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (Mr Perez Ahabwe): Thank you, Mr Speaker. At a time when we were about to take a discussion on this motion, you guided that the House be adjourned. So, I need your guidance again on this matter, whether it is possible to take a decision or not on this matter. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Yesterday, I was approached and asked to give Members time to review the relevant provisions affecting the setting up of interim administration in these new districts and I hope this has been done. So can we proceed?

MR AHABWE: Mr Speaker, in view of the fact that hon. Members do not have any other issues to raise I beg that you put the question. 

2.59
MR HUSSEIN KYANJO (JEEMA, Makindye Division West, Kampala): Mr Speaker, thank you very much. The reason for which we were unable to proceed with the question yesterday still stands. But we continue to learn each day; I would have been interested in giving us the detailed explanation of how we are going to go about this without following the natural trend that we normally follow. 

Otherwise, my objection is in good faith and I fear to get embarrassed as a Member of Parliament. 

3.00
MR JOHN LIVINGSTONE OKELLO-OKELLO (UPC, Chua County, Kitgum): Thank you, Mr Speaker. These councils are already in place and they are working and they have been working since 1st July without the extension. I think for the sake of the name of Parliament, we should wait and do this thing properly when we have the quorum. If we are challenged, it will be a problem for Parliament. So since they have been working without extension, let them continue to work until we get the numbers necessary to extend them properly. They are in office and there is no problem. Thank you.

3.01
MR JOHN EMILLY OTEKAT (Independent, Serere County, Soroti): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am the Chairperson of the Committee of Local Governments and Public Service. I fully support the motion moved by the minister yesterday. I was out with my Committee of Local Governments in Northern Uganda. We happened to meet the council of Otuke; this is one of the districts whose term is supposed to be extended. They were asking me and my team when Parliament would extend their term of office. 

I think the argument given by my colleague hon. Okello-Okello that we wait until we manage to get the numbers will make it very difficult for these interim councils to proceed. They are aware that whatever they are doing is not in consonance with the law. So, I strongly propose that approve the resolution to make the councils move despite –(Interruption)

MR LUKWAGO: Mr Speaker, the reason the minister is moving this motion is for us to cure an illegality; that the councils are not operating illegally. So we want them to operate legally. Now, hon. Otekat is imploring this House to use illegal means to cure an illegality. Is he in order, yet out duty as Parliament is to promote the rule of law in this country?

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I am now adjourning this House to Tuesday at 10.00 a.m. to continue with the business. The House is adjourned. 

 (The House rose at 3.02 p.m. and was adjourned until Tuesday, 28 September 2010, at 10.00 a.m.)
