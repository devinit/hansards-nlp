COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I sincerely want to welcome you back from recess; and, I want to congratulate you upon the completion of the First Session of the 11th Parliament. Congratulations! You did an excellent job! (Applause)

As you may recall, on 14 June 2022, after the presentation of the Budget Speech, I adjourned the House to 5th July, which is today. This was specifically to engage you in your constituency work. Remember, we have to serve our people down there; and this was basically on the Parish Development Model (PDM). I hope you had very good engagements on PDM and fruitful ones. I have been following the media coverage on the activities that were taking place. I was impressed that my Members are doing a good job. I want to commend you for that. (Applause) The efficiency and effectiveness of that programme is going to depend on you. It will make your people change from the level where they are to a better level. So, put a lot of effort into that programme. 

As you are aware, as legislators, we are the voice of the voiceless. We are the only ones who can speak for so many thousands of people out there. We must be able to do our oversight role and ensure we come to this House and speak for them. I implore you to embrace consultative leadership, so that you may build a greater relationship, not only with your constituents, , also with colleagues. I have seen colleagues trying their best, to fundraise, and to do community activities. It is a good effort; continue doing that. As they say, “My net worth is equal to my network”. So, once you have a big network of colleagues, they will be able to help you come back to the House. It is not an easy thing to come back, but when you are here, it is the best thing to do -

Honourable members, today is the Third Sitting of the Second Session of the 11th Parliament of Uganda. As I said in the last sitting of the First Session, on 20 May 2022, we should strive to achieve even better than what we achieved in the previous Parliament. And, if we are to attain this, we have to be cognisant of the following pre-conditions:

Adequate preparation for committee and plenary business;

Dedication and commitment to all parliamentary activities in communities and in the House;

Actual participation in committees and in the House. Some of you end in the committee and do not come to the House; you forget that we have a rule that if you miss 15 times, we can take you out of the House. So, you need to participate. 

I do not believe in the analysis that was done on the performance of Members of Parliament; it is not only about speaking in the House. Members of Parliament have four roles, and I do not even know where they got that information from. My Members of Parliament are working. I do not want to say they did not work simply because they did not speak. One may be speaking, but speaking nothing. Actual participation is at the committee level and in the House; that is what you were elected for. Come and participate in the House and in the committee. Do your oversight role; appropriation - I was surprised that during appropriation, we had a few people, yet that is your core role as Members of Parliament. You should know that it is going to your constituency, so, you should follow it up.

Effective evaluation of evidence in committees and the House: Let us have evidence-based debates in the House. Let us not just come in and say, “In Nakaseke this and this is happening”. What analysis have you done? Do you have empirical evidence to that effect? We should have both quantitative and qualitative research done. Let us be legislators;

Continuous engagement and responsiveness to the will of the populace: We have been having Members in the public demonstrating that kind of thing. We have to be involved;

Ethical conduct and behaviour: When you are out there, you are honourable, whether in the morning or in the evening, whatever the time, you are honourable. You must maintain that conduct. 

In the same vein, I urge the Executive - in the last meeting we held with the President, we agreed that at any one time of a sitting, we should have at least 30 per cent of the Executive in the House. I do not know whether we still respect the decision. 

In the same vein, I urge the Executive to be responsive to the demands and requirements of the legislature. 

With regard to the input and the legislative process that has been laid today, we need a treasury memorandum; when the House agrees that we need feedback from the Executive, you should be able to present to the House when it is required, other than going to Cabinet and lamenting. Give us the treasury memorandum. Do not start lamenting that the House is bad or useless. We are here constitutionally as Members of Parliament, and we will do what we are supposed to do. If you choose to blackmail us in Cabinet, it is none of our business. We shall do what we are supposed to do. We shall ask you questions, and you will have to answer. We will ask you for the treasury memoranda on the actions you take, and you must take actions, within the law. If you think you will do something contrary, forget it. This is the legislature, and one of our roles is oversight. 

During the State-of-the-Nation Address, on 7th June, His Excellency outlined the Government legislative agenda and gave us 62 Bills to be introduced in the House. 

As Legislature, we are prepared and waiting for the Bills. In the first session of this term we want to process all the Bills. In the same vein, Members, it is also your constitutional right to bring Private Members’ Bills.

Honourable members, the Business Committee sat this morning and approved the Government Legislative Agenda, which we are going to follow. We will be waiting to hear from Government what they have. The legislative agenda is going to be circulated to all of you; the Clerk will do that. 

Over the last few days, there has been concern on the plight of teachers and learners in public institutions. This follows industrial action by teachers. Such industrial actions have become regular in our education sector. Therefore, I urge Government to carefully study the grievances of the teachers and devise a sustainable solution with realistic, immediate, medium-term and long-term interventions so that we can be able to resolve these issues. We should not be doing things in an ad hoc manner. 

I will require the Rt Hon. Prime Minister and Leader of Government Business to present to the House a comprehensive statement on this matter; what we are dealing with and the intervention that Government is planning on this matter.

In the meantime - we know what it means. As the Legislature, we urge the teachers to return to classes and teach, as the Government devises a sustainable remedy to their grievances.

We will stand with the teachers to ensure we support them, but mindful of the conditions in the country. We request the teachers to go back and do their noble duty, as we see how support the young ones outside there. It is not an easy thing, but I believe Government is looking into it.

As Parliament, we will always hold Government accountable for their undertakings and the resolutions they come up with. If Government comes up and says they are going to do this, Parliament will come in and support the teachers in their plight.

Honourbale members, I wish you a productive and impactful Second Session of the 11th Parliament. Once again, I would like to welcome you. We started the First Session while walking; we must start this one while running. (Applause) 

We should be able to double our efforts to expeditiously handle the 62 Bills that we have been given, such that by the fourth year, we do not have much work and then we can go back and campaign. Thank you very much –(Ms Cecilia Ogwal rose_) Instead of first clapping for what the Speaker has said, you are just -(Laughter)
 
Hon. Cecilia, are you reacting to the Communication from the Chair? Okay. Can we start with Hon. Cecilia and then Hon. Solomon?

2.14
MS CECILIA OGWAL (FDC, Woman Representative, Dokolo): Thank you, Madam Speaker. We also welcome you back to this session, and appreciate the excellent job you have been doing for us outside there. 

On the issue of industrial action by the teachers, much as we appreciate the role that Government is playing, you will realise that as elected Members of Parliament, we had a very uncomfortable recess because of the situation on the ground. 

Madam Speaker, it is not about the arts teachers’ strike; it is about equality. And, that is one issue we need to address, in compliance with the law we have; the law on equal opportunity. We need to address it, also, in terms of equity. 

Whereas we have teachers teaching our children, we must come out with a clear definition of why we should have two schedules of salary payment, when paying teachers. So, it is very important that we start with a definition.

Madam Speaker, although you have given an assignment to the Rt Hon. Prime Minister, I think it is going to be difficult for the Prime Minister to start running around to find the best formula. First of all, we have to identify the factors which caused that change in the manner in which we pay teachers. We need to come up with that.

I am concerned about a situation, where a head teacher is an arts teacher, and we have some science teachers in that school. You will find a situation where a science teacher is getting double the salary of the head teacher. This creates disparity in the schools. So, we need to define it and guide the Office of the Prime Minister so that we deal with this matter once and for all. If we leave it to Government, it will eventually bounce back to us. 

I am requesting you, Madam Speaker, to maybe guide the House further. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, anything related to the industrial action will be discussed when they bring a comprehensive report. Let us not pre-empt it. We want to understand this inequality. Otherwise, not all of us are scientists, yet we are here. 

Let us wait for the report from the minister. Then, we will debate and we come up with the solutions and actions to be taken. We all feel for the teachers and we must take action on this. 

2.18
MR SOLOMON SILWANY (NRM, Bukooli County Central, Bugiri): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I stand to react to your communication, regarding the quality of debate in this House.  It is very important and paramount that we debate with information and facts. 

I would like to inform you that as a backbench Parliamentary Commissioner, we have clustered research assistants and senior research officers, where every Member of Parliament is entitled to go and pick information. 

Honourable members, in case you want to do research in a specific field, you do not need to go and do research privately. We have research assistants, and by the end of today, I am going to work with the Clerk so that we pin up the list and cluster different Members under different research assistants. That way, we can easily go and get information, work with the researchers, as we continue to increase the quality of debate in this House.

As you have ruled, Madam Speaker, in this session, we are going to run, and not walk. That was the information I wanted to add.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you, Commissioner, for that innovation.

2.19
MR SAMUEL OPIO (Independent, Kole County North, Kole): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I just want to react to your communication, regarding the Parish Development Model. Whereas we have been on the ground to provide oversight and sensitisation, we have noticed some gaps, which I will request urgent intervention.

One of the areas is on the enterprise selection. It is true we have been given a guiding document, which is known as the “Agricultural Zoning Strategy” which talks about the profitability of the enterprises. However, when you look at this document, for example, dairy, it is talking of an investment of Shs 126 million. While for the beef industry, its an investment of Shs 56 million. Fish farming is slightly over Shs 20 million, yet the maximum amount to lend to a household is Shs 1 million.

So, my prayer is that the Ministry of Local Government reviews this document and aligns it with the amount of money that we are going to give out to these households. This will enable them to benefit from it. Otherwise, what is being given to us to guide them does not match what we expect out of them. Thank you. 

THE SPEAKER: Thank you. Honourable members, I want you to put in writing all your findings from the PDM. We will compile and give them to the secretariat or the persons responsible, to look at them and see how they can align them together before the money is disbursed. The good thing is that the money has not been disbursed; let us first see the loopholes that are available. Yes, Hon. Ssemujju? Leader of the Opposition, you will come in thereafter.

2.21
MR IBRAHIM SSEMUJJU (FDC, Kira Municipality, Wakiso): Madam Speaker, I want to thank you very much, but also to specifically thank you for keeping time. (Applause) There was a time when we were made to wait for two hours. (Laughter) Some of us whose training emphasised time keeping would sometimes give in and leave. I do not want to take that for granted. I want to thank you for not only encouraging MPs, but also, for being exemplary. (Applause) 

Madam Speaker, you have urged the teachers to return to work. Even if I do not agree with it, I now fear to contradict you. If you had not said that, I would be urging Government to give teachers the same pay; but as you have guided, we will be waiting for the report.

I have two specific issues, Madam Speaker: The first, you have said we need to be running not walking and I am ready to begin the running. During the recess, many things happened. For those of us who feed off and keep reading the media, I was troubled by a report that one of the ministers, Gen. Severino Kahinda Otafiire, had blasted the Prime Minister and nearly slapped her –(Laughter)– yet under the Constitution, the Prime Minister is supposed to be coordinating these ministers – and I am speaking this with experience.

When we had Hon. Kintu Musoke as a Prime Minister, ministers were not attending – I was here as a journalist. The attendance improved when we had the late Prof. Apollo Nsibambi. If you have ministers quarrelling and one of them threatening to slap the Prime Minister during a Cabinet meeting, can we be told that these ministers and their supervisors are talking? I am saying this because as I said, I saw here, under Prime Minister Kintu Musoke, ministers not attending because of communication. 

But if we have communication and attendance improving, yet you have one of the ministers dismissing the supervisor as being “mechanical and unconventional” can Government assure us that maybe the media report was false; that the Prime Minister is not mechanical and not –otherwise, we are going to have a problem, Madam Speaker?

The second issue - we also read that the military had been put on standby Class One. In other countries, that announcement is made when there is an impending invasion. Did the military want to take over President Museveni’s Government? Do we have a country that threatened Uganda and so, that is why the military was put on standby Class One? 

Madam Speaker, as you ask the Prime Minister to come and explain about the teachers’ fate, can we be told if we need to begin preparing our luggage, because there is war that is about to happen in Uganda? Thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, in my communication, I said whatever we say should have evidence; it should be evidence-based. Let us not legislate on hearsay. (Applause) Newspapers, the press will write anything; they love writing the negative part of it. As for me, I have not heard about it. I am not aware of it. If it is on social media there, it is for them to do their social media work.

As for me, I am not aware whether there was that instruction. If there was a fight, it could have been a friendly fight in the house. A man and woman may fight in their house. I do not think you have never quarreled with Hajjati. So, if there is any problem, that can be resolved in the house. (Members rose_) Is this all on Communication from the Chair? 

HON. MEMBERS: Yes. 

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, today, we only have one item. You are communicating when we do not have committees.

2.26
THE CHIEF OPPOSITION WHIP (Mr John Baptist Nambeshe): Madam Speaker, let me join colleagues to thank you for urging teachers to get back to the classrooms. I also thank you for directing the Leader of Government Business to come here with a report. However, Madam Speaker, this is a matter of urgency because the selective salary enhancement for the science teachers was discriminatory in nature and has opened a Pandora’s box. 

Actually, Government is even on notice by the Uganda Local Government Association (ULGA). That is a local governments’ association or a union for local government staff, but we are likely to have many more, including health workers.

So, it would be prudent, Madam Speaker, to include a timeframe in that directive. But also, this House should prevail over the powers that be, in the event that we do not have a salaries and remunerations review commission that can harmonise wages for public sector workers; we should avoid such scenarios that infringe on the rights, as per the Bill of Rights in our Constitution. I am saying this because equal pay for equal work done is a provision enshrined in our Constitution.
 
However, this is happening and we are giving selective attention to a category of workers who have been working in harmony. Even when an allowance of 30 per cent in itself had not caused any rifts - this was way back in 2012 – I wish we could have stuck on a special allowance increment, which would also have pension fund obligations in future.

So, Madam Speaker, my take is that the report should be comprehensive. It should seek to introduce a Bill in this House on the pension fund. It is not there for public sector workers, by the way. It would be our considered view, as the Opposition, to also push for a special allowance rather than ad hoc,  selective,  salary increments, which would even burden that pension fund. 

I beg to submit, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you. We shall be waiting for your Bill at an appropriate time. Honourable members, in the VIP gallery this afternoon, we have a delegation from the National Assembly of Zambia, under the Zambian Parliamentary Reforms and Modernisation Committee.

We have:

Hon. Moses Moyo, the Second Deputy Speaker;
Hon. Princess Kasune, the Deputy Government Chief Whip;
Hon. Mulambo Haimbe, the Minister for Justice;
Hon. Joel Chibuye;
Hon. Saiti Michelo;
Hon. Mutotwe;
Hon. Elias Musonda;
Hon. Marjorie Nakaponda;
Mr Kasanga;
Mr Katesi;
Mr Chirwa;
Mr Lombe Musonda. 

You are all welcome. (Applause)

They are here to benchmark on the budgeting process of our Parliament and see if they can borrow a leaf from us. Join me to welcome all of them. You are most welcome. (Applause) This is the Parliament of Uganda – the most friendly Parliament in Africa. 

2.32
MS SARAH OPENDI (NRM, Woman Representative, Tororo): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I thank God for keeping all of us healthy and alive during the recess period. You did mention the performance of this Parliament in the last session and you talked about Bills. 

However, I would like to raise the matter that other than the Bills, Members bring petitions, raise matters of national importance and ask questions for oral answers. Reports from committees are also presented on the Floor of this House. 

Madam Speaker, you do give directives to ministers to come – maybe, like the very last report we considered for the physical infrastructure committee, you did direct the Minister for Lands, Housing and Urban Development to come and explain to this House or give a report on what action had been taken regarding the issue of the certificate of title which is in dfcu Bank. 

Madam Speaker, some of these directives given by you can, sometimes, be lost if they are not followed up. Since you said we must run, it is important that these pending matters are brought so that the ministers can come and respond to them. 

I did present a petition in this House and you gave the Minister for Health two weeks. It was a petition regarding maternal mortality – the high number of mothers dying in our health facilities. We ended the session, but I am glad the minister is here. 

Yesterday – if some of you watched that report from Kitagwenda District, where the health workers were simply saying: “You can die as many as you can. For as long as Government does not construct houses for us, there will be no doctor to attend to you. We shall come and attend to the mothers as and when we can.” Mothers are dying in this health facility. 

Madam Speaker, it is a shame. All these are preventable deaths. This Parliament, honourable minister, would like to help you. 

Therefore, Madam Speaker, the matter that I am raising is that as we run with the Bills, can we also run and handle the petitions expeditiously? I brought up the issue of school fees. I am glad the President has talked and even said that we could consider having completely free education. The Education (Pre-Primary, Primary and Post-Primary) Act provides that we can have an education fee so that people can contribute and our children are able to study for free without any encumbrances or challenges. 

Madam Speaker, this petition is before the committee – and other petitions that I brought. We had the issue of the car tracker – the Russian company that was supposed to put these car trackers in our vehicles. These petitions are before the committees. Can these petitions be handled expeditiously?

Madam Speaker, I beg that you use your authority to direct now that we are going to have the committees reconstituted. Can we prioritise the previous session’s work that has not been concluded before we start on new work? 

Thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you, honourable members. Because of the urgency of the motions, petitions and the Bills that are in committees, we have suggested that we are not going to make any major changes at committee level until they finish. (Applause) We will invoke the rule on one year and make sure that you work for two years in that committee so that you get the feel of a committee – not for a Member to move  from one committee to the other each year. 

Clerk, we want you to extract all the pending work – the motions and all the petitions – and we have them discussed in the House. Have them on the Order Paper and we discuss and dispose of them.

Members, can we have a very important thing that you need today – you need committees. (Applause) Regarding matters of national importance – kindly, you will come tomorrow after you have known where your matter is headed. The issue that you are raising, you will bring it tomorrow. We have a whole session – one year. 

BILLS
FIRST READING

THE UGANDA HUMAN ORGAN DONATION AND TRANSPLANT BILL, 2021

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, as you may recall, this matter of organ transplant and donation has been a topical issue in the country for a while. More recently, we had debates about this issue of organ harvesting. We need a legal document to that effect for it to be effective and to avoid other implications. Having a legal regime will help this country. This was brought in the House and now it is coming for the first reading. Honourable minister?

2.38
THE MINISTER OF HEALTH (Dr Jane Ruth Aceng): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. Allow me to add my voice to welcome you and all the Members back from the recess. 

I beg to lay the Bill entitled, “The Uganda Human Organ Donation and Transplant Bill, 2021”, accompanied with its Certificate of Financial Implications, for the first reading. 

I beg to lay.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you, honourable minister. The Bill, is accordingly referred to the Committee on Health pursuant to rule 129 and the 45 days prescribed under rule 129(2). However, if we can have it even in 10 days, that will be better.

THE CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2022

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, on 11 November 2021, the House granted leave to Hon. Karubanga Jacob Ateenyi, MP Kibanda South County, to introduce the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2022. The Member duly obtained the Certificate of Financial Implications pursuant to Section 79 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015. I now invite the Member to table his Bill for the first reading.

2.40
Mr Jacob Karubanga (NRM, Kibanda South County, Kiryandongo): Thank you, Madam Speaker –(Interruption)

Mr ssemujju: Madam Speaker, a number of colleagues have presented Bills for constitution amendment, including the one of Hon. Wilfred Niwagaba that we processed and was about to go for committee stage –

THE SPEAKER: Let him first lay then you come with your point of procedure.

Mr karubanga: Madam Speaker, I move that the Bill entitled, “The Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2022” be read the first time. I beg to lay.

THE SPEAKER: Certificate of Financial Implication?

Mr Karubanga: Madam Speaker, accompanied with the Bill is the Certificate of Financial Implications. I beg to lay it too.

THE SPEAKER: Is the Minister for Constitutional Affairs here? Honourable members, I notice that the object of the Bill is to amend the Third Schedule of the Constitution to include five additional ethnic groups as part of Uganda’s indigenous communities.

Whereas we are duty-bound, as Parliament, to ensure equal access to opportunities and resources for people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalised, such as the ethnic communities that the Bill seeks to include in the Constitution; it is imperative that this is done comprehensively to avoid piecemeal amendments of the Constitution. This will require Government to conduct a robust appraisal of indigenous communities that for one reason or the other have not been listed in the Constitution, and comes up with a holistic Bill for the inclusion of all of them. 

I will remind you that the issue of the inclusion of the Maragoli began in the last Parliament with Hon. Odur Jack, seeking leave to introduce the same Bill. The Bill we have before us today is introducing four additional communities. I know one of them is yours, honourable minister. This implies that if the 10th Parliament had proceeded with this Bill, then today we would be having the same kind of Bill, if we did not do it holistically.

Honourable members, whereas it has been argued that frequent amendment of the Constitution ensures adaptation and changes in realities, we ought to be alive to the changes, and to the fact that we should have a Constitutional Review Commission that should do this work. 

It is against this background, honourable minister, that we ask you to ensure that we have the commission in place to have a holistic amendment of the Constitution other than piecemeal amendments. This, therefore, makes me ask you to have that in place as soon as possible so that we have all these amendments. Hon. Ssemujju was about to talk about a constitutional amendment, but we cannot have it and then another later. 

Mr ssemujju: Madam Speaker, you had allowed me, if the minister responsible for Public Service can hold on –(Laughter) 

THE SPEAKER: In that circumstance, therefore, I hereby stand over the introduction of the Bill until more conclusive and preferable amendments are brought to the House.

Mr ssemujju: Thank you, Madam Speaker. You have addressed many of my concerns. In the budget that we processed, Government wanted funding for the Constitutional Review Commission. The background I was giving is that many Members have presented Bills to amend the Constitution, but in the past, only the one removing the age-limits by Hon. Magyezi was processed urgently.

The former Minister for Constitutional Affairs – now Minister for Public Service – even named eminent Ugandans including Hon. Dan Wandera Ogalo to go and serve on the committee. Can the minister tell us what happened? 

We had brought here amendments and we were told there was no time, but we would have dealt with them in the previous Parliament. All the subsequent Bills that have been tabled here - by Hon. Nsamba and Hon. Lyomoki - are all not processed. Can Government tell us why they reversed that decision? Even when they have included it in the budget for this year, it is not one of the issues that are going to be considered.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable minister, when do we expect the commission to be in place?

2.48
The ACTINg minister for justice and constitutional affairs (Mr Muruli Mukasa): Madam Speaker, the process of establishing the Constitutional Review Commission has actually started. The proposal has been forwarded to Cabinet. It is awaiting Cabinet discussion. I can say that in due course, this commission will be established and it will take care of these amendments, which are being proposed by the honourable members and also the public. 

Also, the urgency of this commission is felt by Cabinet that it should be given ample time to interact with all the interested parties and the stakeholders so that all the amendments that merit being covered, are captured and presented. I would like to say that, yes, the process has started and –(Interruption) 

MR SILWANY: Thank you, honourable minister, for giving way. Madam Speaker, whenever the issue on the Constitutional Review Commission comes up - I remember candidly well, the former minister for Constitutional Affairs stated the same thing to this House. He said the process had started and that they are waiting for Cabinet to have a discussion. Could the minister give us more evidence that this has actually started? Otherwise, this has been the same statement year in, year out. 

Whenever Members raise an issue on the Constitutional Review Commission, a minister comes and says the process has started. Does this process start and die, then start and collapse? Where are we exactly? Today, we need a clear answer that is nearer to fact so that we go knowing that maybe in one year or two years or 20 years, we are going to have the Constitutional Review Commission. Thank you. That is the clarification I seek.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable minister, your response is so ambiguous that we cannot even understand what you are saying. We need to understand the number of months. Even if you do not achieve it in that timeframe, you can come back to the House and tell us the position. Otherwise, we need that commission.

MR GAFABUSA: Additionally, Madam Speaker, when the previous Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs was presenting on the Floor, he went ahead to tell us that the proposals – 

THE SPEAKER: …were being vetted by the security. 

MR GAFABUSA: The proposals for the names to be included on the commission had already been presented to the President. Now you are telling us the matter is waiting for a Cabinet discussion; that is taking us backwards. What happened to the names that had been proposed and presented to the President for consideration?

THE SPEAKER: Honourable minister, what happened to the names that were proposed and presented to the President? If you do not have a response to that effect, can you come back on Tuesday and report to this House? Since you have a Cabinet meeting on Monday, you should be able to raise it and report to the House on the - we are helping you to do your work.

MR MURULI-MUKASA: I am much obliged, Madam Speaker. However, I seek your indulgence to make one correction. I am the acting Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs and I started acting quite recently. I was not the Minister for – 

THE SPEAKER: Honourable minister – 

MR MURULI-MUKASA: I am just correcting what –

THE SPEAKER: Honourable minister, that is why I have given you one week because I know you are acting. 

MR MURULI-MUKASA: That is right. 

THE SPEAKER: I know you were not the minister then.

MR MURULI-MUKASA: Much obliged, Madam Speaker. I will be here on Tuesday.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, meanwhile, we had elections in the Pan African Parliament, where we were able to get a number of positions as Uganda. Is Hon. Caroline Kamusiime here? I will be waiting for a report to be presented here on the positions we got from the Pan African Parliament. Let the commission come and report on Tuesday. 

MR KATUSABE: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I would like to join the rest of my colleagues to welcome you back. The feedback I have from Kasese is that you have their prayers and they enjoy the way you look at Uganda as a family.

Madam Speaker, I am rising on a procedural matter. About two months ago, you gave instructions to Government and directed them to ensure that our fellow citizens that are incarcerated in prisons and need urgent medical attention do so without further delay. In your Chair, you directed Government. We, as a House, and fellow citizens, were excited. 

However, the Government that you directed never paid attention at all. You are aware my fellow citizens that, so far, as Kasese Community, we have lost 10 people in prison just because when they needed medical attention, they never got that attention. 

Madam Speaker, prisons are not hospitals – prisons are prisons. As I speak, we have a body stuck with Government. We thought, as Members of Parliament, enough is enough. Where do we take this body? The Speaker directed Government to ensure that those that are in prison get the medical attention that they need, but Government as usual decided not to pay attention at all. 

The procedural issue I am raising – 

THE SPEAKER: Hon. John, he rose on a procedural issue; so, you do not raise a procedural issue on procedure. 

MR KATUSABE: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker, for your illustrious leadership -

THE SPEAKER: Hon. John, I invested a lot of money on training Members here in the last two weeks, and I thought those are some of the small things we should have gotten to know. 

MR KATUSABE: Madam Speaker, my procedural issue is just crystal clear. Is it procedurally correct for Government to continue disregarding your instructions when in actual sense, constitutionally, your word here becomes the last word. 

The people from Kasese are asking: How many dead bodies is Government waiting for, in order that those that are still in prisons get the medical attention they need? Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you. I have already instructed the Clerk to extract all the pending issues that were in the last session. Is the Attorney-General here? We will want the Attorney-General to give us feedback. Please give us a comprehensive statement on the persons who are in prisons, what actions have been taken, and the way forward. 

Therefore, we will need a paper to that effect. All pending issues must be disposed of in these first two weeks. Hon. John Musila, you have something. What was your matter, raster?

MR MUSILA: Madam Speaker, thank you for this chance. Certainly, I did not have time to thank you directly for guiding us throughout the last session. I know so many jabs came at you; we had many bad things to speak about you. 

Anyhow, I rise according to rule 4 of our Rules of Procedure which talks about us debating in English. I know the accents of this country; the western spooner and the stammer, the northern haskayne language, that of the east, which is laissez-faire and the central counter. 

Now, our colleague – the accent – Madam Speaker, I am very sure that at times, you also simply estimate the theme. (Laughter) This is not the accent for Uganda. He has been doing this in the last session. Now, if we begin - especially now that you guided us that we should run and you are at the forefront of that running, we do not want to estimate what somebody is saying. I thank you, Madam Speaker. (Laughter)

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, that was a commercial break. (Laughter) Hon. Atkins was speaking English. It is just because you studied in those schools in Manafwa District –(Laughter)– but he was speaking English. Next item.

The reports are referred to the Committee on Public Accounts (Local Government) under rule 182 (4) and you should process these reports as fast as possible. Remember we have an expiry of the reports within six months and then they are automatically adopted, especially for the accountability committees. We want these reports processed and presented to the House. Do not sit on the reports. If you cannot do it as one committee, divide your committee into four and move on the ground. I am not going to allow this explanation that there was no funding. Now the committees are going to have funding. (Applause) What we want is work from the committees. Next item.

DESIGNATION OF MEMBERS TO SECTORAL COMMITTEES 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 187(1) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE

THE SPEAKER: When we started the first session, Members were designated to committees. We have sectoral and standing committees. Under rule 187 of the Rules of Procedure, the sectoral committee members serve for one year. The persons responsible for the assignment of this are the whips, as per our Rules of Procedure and the Administration of Parliament Act. 

However, I am cognisant of the rule that one party, as of now, does not have a whip. I want to make my ruling to that effect before we receive the names. Rule 187(1) of the Rules of Procedure states that, “There shall be sectoral committees of the House, whose members shall be designated by whips on the basis of party or organisation representation and interests of Independent Members in the House at the beginning of every session of Parliament.” 

Section 6H (1) of the Administration of Parliament Act and rule 15(1) of the Rules of Procedure provide for the Government Chief Whip appointed by Government from among Members of Parliament representing the ruling party.

Section 6H(2) is clear that the role and function of the Government Chief Whip is to ensure due attendance, participation in the proceedings and voting in Parliament of Members of the ruling party. The same is replicated in rule 15(2) of the Rules of Procedure. 

Section 6H(3) goes further to state that the Government Chief Whip shall also perform the functions as may be prescribed by the Rules of Procedure. The prescription of these other functions is done under rule 15(10) to include supplying lists of Members to serve on the standing committees and sectoral committees.

The above notwithstanding, Article 108A(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda provides for the appointment of the Prime Minister. Under Article 108A(2)(a), the Prime Minister is designated as the Leader of Government Business in Parliament, responsible for coordination and implementation of Government policies across the ministries, departments and public institutions. 

It is, therefore, clear that the Prime Minister leads and spearheads Government business in the House. The Cabinet and other ministers – the Government Chief Whip included – only lend a helping hand and are, indeed, under the charge of the Prime Minister in her capacity as Leader of Government Business.

While I am aware of the provision of Section 6H of The Administration of Parliament Act and rule 15 of Rules of Procedure, I am also bound by the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, which is the supreme law of the land, as per Article 2. The Constitution is clear on who spearheads Government business in the House. The Constitution has binding force on all authorities and persons throughout Uganda. 

Indeed, if any law – our Rules of Procedure included – or any custom is inconsistent with any of the provisions of the Constitution, the Constitution shall always prevail and that other law or custom shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.

It is, therefore, my ruling that in the absence of the Government Chief Whip, who as illustrated above helps the Prime Minister in coordinating Government business in Parliament, the supply of the list of Members to serve on the committees can legally be done – and I am saying “can legally be done” – by the Prime Minister in her capacity as the Leader of Government Business. We should not stifle the operation of this House because there is one person missing. 

I, therefore, ask the Prime Minister to give us the list – [MEMBER: “Procedure.”]- Procedure on my ruling?

MR SSEMUJJU: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. You see, the rules are very protective of the Speaker. Even when you disagree, the processing of that disagreement is very difficult. 

The procedural issue I am raising is, now that you have said that the Prime Minister can become the Government Chief Whip to supply the lists – I am asking you to help me and also give a ruling on Section 6H of the Administration of Parliament Act, which says, “there shall be – the word “shall” – in Parliament the Government Chief Whip…” The rest you have said, Madam Speaker. “Shall” is a command. 

Madam Speaker, I respect your ruling, but my fear is that it is going to be abused. For more than a year, this country has no Governor of the Central Bank, yet the President and his wife are on honeymoon in Ntungamo. (Laughter)

Madam Speaker, I fear that if you create room – when the Speaker of this Parliament died, we were told that in the first sitting, we must choose a Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Ssemujju, I do not think you should talk about people honeymooning. Leave people to enjoy their lives. If you want to go for honeymoon, kindly go for a honeymoon with your wife. I do not see how the name of the President can come in here. 

I have made a ruling and you know how to challenge the Speaker’s ruling. For now, if you want a ruling on section 6H, I will deliver it at an ample time.

MR SSEMUJJU: Madam Speaker, certainly I cannot challenge your ruling. I want to thank you because you have made a pledge that you will. 

THE SPEAKER: I am actually offering you a honeymoon with Hajjat; tell me when you are ready. (Laughter)

MR SSEMUJJU: Madam Speaker, I said this in good faith. At the beginning of this session, you said we are supposed to attend Parliament and there are a number of times when we are not here. You actually said that a Member of Parliament can be thrown out. 

I am not attacking anyone's honeymoon; I am only surprised that people who have no time to appoint the Governor of the Central Bank or to deal with the crisis of inflation have time to go on honeymoon. 

Once you have done your work - certainly I want to thank you for giving me an offer when we have attended a number of times and I am supposed to attend as an MP. I will come to you for that offer, but someone has a duty. 

So, I am only asking you to remind this person that has a duty under the Constitution to do it. After that, they can even go to Rome or Kigali.

THE SPEAKER: No problem, I will make the humble reminder, but the Bank of Uganda Act is not entrenched. It says that in the absence of the Governor, the Deputy Governor will always act. It is not like Parliament where you need to have an election first. However, it does not cause any harm for us to have the Governor.

I am aware that we have a Governor in place and the banking sector is operating. Honourable members, having these committees designated is a very important thing. As we are all aware, the committees are the engines of processing all the legislative business. 

We need to have this done as soon as now. I, therefore, call upon the whips and the Prime Minister to designate the Members. The Office of the Clerk will have the report compiled for the chairpersons to know their Members. We have NRM, NUP, DP, UPC, PPP, UPDF and the Independents. 

In the end, every committee membership list will be given out to all the members and you will know your members. As I had made a statement earlier, we are not going to make fundamental changes because we want Members to have the grasp of a committee before they move to another committee, rather than running around committees every year. At the end of the day, you do not know what you have done in that period. 

3.22
MR JOHN BAPTIST NAMBESHE (NUP, Opposition Chief Whip): Madam Speaker, I am not challenging your ruling and I am not one that would attempt to do that. However, I am constrained to hold my peace on Article 108 (A), which expounds on the appointment of the Prime Minister who doubles as the Leader of Government Business. 

The appointment of the Chief Whip, as per rule 15 as you vividly put it, is by Government and the word here is “shall”. “There shall be -”

THE SPEAKER: What is the difference between what you are asking and what Hajji said? 

MR NAMBESHE: I am about to conclude. So, this “shall” would mean that if the Leader of Government Business is going to perform the role of the Whip, who is supposed to be appointed by Government - we should avoid future litigation - it would mean that, that person or office has constituted itself into Government. I am only doing this in good faith to avoid future litigation. 

MS CECILIA OGWAL: Madam Speaker, when we adopted the multi-party system, it was agreed that the Office of the Prime Minister will deal with Executive matters; that it would coordinate them. However, in a multiparty dispensation, the Whips deal with political issues. 

Therefore, the office of the Government whip is to coordinate political issues of the ruling party and the same refers to other parties in Parliament. As such, matters to do with political parties and political choices to the committees will require the Whip. 

When it comes to the functionalisation of Government, coordinating with Parliament and so on, you now need the Office of the Prime Minister and many of us feel very comfortable dealing with the Prime Minister because she is executive and I can consult her at all times. 

However, when it comes to me accessing the office of the Whip of the NRM, you know that I have to maybe change my dressing and my mannerism. Many times when I need a favour from them, I try to put on yellow and they do not even recognise me.

As you can see, I am lobbying the National Unity Platform by putting on red, hoping that they will put me in the committee which I need to join. (Laughter)

So, I am seeking clarification. I have been observing and I know that definitely, the Whip must specifically handle issues to do with the political parties. I beg to submit.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you, Members. I have heard your issues. I have heard your cries. I know what the law requires of us and we will have a Whip. We should not stagnate our work in the absence of a Whip. We are not going to wait for people to do what they are supposed to do. Let us move on. Can we have the designation done? Prime Minister, please remind the Executive that we need a Whip.

3.26
THE THIRD DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO (Ms Rukia Nakadama): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I take the opportunity to welcome you back from the recess and I thank those who joined us -

MR KIBALYA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. An opportunity has come that through your office, you can intervene so that in future, we do not experience the same scenario we are going through now. The NRM Party that I belong to has a deputy whip. 

In most circumstances, the vice-chairperson acts as the deputy whip and I believe it is the position we vote him in. Maybe in future, we shall clearly get informed of the role of the vice or deputy whip so that when such a scenario arises, we do not go back to what we have gone through.

THE SPEAKER: The issue of a deputy whip is an internal party arrangement. Can we have designation? 

MS NAKADAMA: Thank you. I was thanking the Members who joined ministers to go around the country to popularise the Parish Development Model programme. Welcome back. 

Madam Speaker, I start with the Committee on Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries. On this committee, the Government side has designated the following Members:

Hon. Okori-Moe Janet	-	Chairperson 
Hon. Dr Agnes Atim	-	Vice-Chairperson
Hon. Aber Lillian

Madam Speaker, I beg to designate.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you. NUP?	

3.31
THE CHIEF OPPOSITION WHIP (Mr John Baptist Nambeshe): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. At the beginning of every session of Parliament, there shall be sectoral committees of the House, whose members shall be designated by whips – and I am the Chief Opposition Whip, Madam Speaker. By virtue of that office, in accordance with rule 187(1) of our Rules of Procedure, I have already supplied all the lists of Members that are to serve on the sectoral committees.

For your information, Madam Speaker, the changes are affecting only eight Members; those I have relocated and designated to new sectoral committees. So, I will seek your indulgence whether, in the interest of time, I should read the entire list, including those that have maintained the status quo or only the eight that have changed.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, we are reading the whole list; committee by committee. If NRM has not even changed one Member, they will be the ones to say, “We are maintaining the status quo”, but they are reading one by one. That is what designation is.

MR NAMBESHE: Much obliged, Madam Speaker. On my side, we have six parties and so I will commence with the People's Progressive Party (PPP). Under the PPP, on the sectoral committee, we have Hon. Okot Santa, on the Committee on Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries. I beg to designate.

Madam Speaker, on the Democratic Party, I beg to designate Hon. Okot Peter to the Sectoral Committee on Presidential Affairs –(Interjections)

THE SPEAKER: I thought we are on agriculture.

MR NAMBESHE: Let me deal with agriculture. On the Committee on Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, for National Unity Platform, these are the Members.

THE SPEAKER: Pardon?

MAJ. DR ALANYO: The Members have remained and so we maintain the status quo.

THE SPEAKER: Where is the list? We want the names.

MAJ. DR ALANYO: The General is a bit committed. (Laughter) The Member on the Sectoral Committee on Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries is Maj. Gen. Sam Kavuma.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you. Independents? Maj. Alanyo, designate. (Laughter)

MAJ. DR ALANYO: Thank you, Madam Speaker. The UPDF member designated to the Sectoral Committee on Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries is Hon. Maj. Gen. Sam Kavuma. I beg to designate. (Applause)
 
THE SPEAKER: Hon. Ssemujju, that is her maiden speech.

MR SSEMUJJU: Much obliged. Madam Speaker, our rules and the Administration of Parliament Act do not provide for the whip of UPDF. Therefore, under which rule is the Member designating soldiers here? 

THE SPEAKER: Independents.

Hon. Mushemeza Elijah Dickens
Hon. Amero Susan

Madam Speaker, I beg to designate.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you. I put the question that the Committee on Tourism, Trade and Industry be constituted as proposed.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE SPEAKER: We have done the constitution of the committees. We have Science, Technology and Innovation; we will handle it later. That brings us to the completion of our sectoral committees. The sectoral committees should go ahead and work; finish all the business in the committees, and present all your reports to the House. No business of sitting on reports, petitions, motions and Bills.

4.43
MR JAMES KUBEKETERYA (NRM, Bunya County East, Mayuge): Madam Speaker, this one regards the standing committees. There are Members who are on the Committee on Appointments who do not have standing committees. I think when we had just come here, the Rules of Procedure were misread. So, most Members on committees like the Committee on Appointments are entitled to be on another standing committee. 

So, Madam Speaker, I do not know when those Members’ names will be designated on the standing committees.

THE SPEAKER: Kindly designate the Members of the Committee on Appointments to other committees too because they are entitled to have three committees. Yes, another procedural matter from Imat Cecilia, Miss Uganda. (Laughter)

MS OGWAL: Thank you, Madam Speaker, for that permanent title of Miss Uganda. (Laughter) I would like to draw the attention of the House to two specific clauses in our Rules of Procedure:

One; I beg to draw the attention of the Speaker of Parliament to rule 157(4), which requires – by our rule – that 40 per cent of the leadership must be women. So, in all this that the Prime Minister and the Chief Opposition Whip have presented, I believe that they have complied with the prescription, as per rule 157(4).

Secondly, Madam Speaker, I am seeking guidance from the Speaker; whereas rule 88(6) directs that no active Member of the UPDF should be designated chairperson or deputy chairperson, in the body of the rules, there is no specific prescription on how UPDF is represented. 

So, maybe by practice, we could say UPDF, since they do not belong to any party - although they are probably being misdirected to be on the side of the NRM – I know according to our Constitution, they belong to no party. They should be grouped with the Independents, in which case, in future, they should apply to the Office of the Speaker for the purpose of designation. That is just for us to be smart in the way we comply with our own rules.

Finally, Madam Speaker, rule 187 is very specific: Much as the Prime Minister, who presented the list today has done it very smartly, however, the rule is very specific. It says the designation must be done by the whips on the basis of party. 

Therefore, before we adopt this, can we agree that we put aside this particular prescription for the purpose of making our final decision, free from any challenge from Hon. Ibrahim Ssemujju. 

Madam Speaker, I beg to submit, but I seek your guidance. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much, Imat. One, I would like to assure you that the presiding officer is a woman, and mindful of the 40 per cent rule. So, the 40 per cent is catered for. 

Two, the UPDF, and the Dean of the Independents write to the Speaker and we nominate them for the positions. That is why the acting dean of the Independents was claiming his Member. 

I already made a ruling to the last guidance you sought, and the ruling still stands. 

MR SSEMUJU: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I did not want to raise this at the time of designation. 

The Constitution, under which the Prime Minister is appointed, does not provide for a deputy; one, two or three. I do not know how many there are. Neither do our Rules of Procedure provide for a deputy Prime Minister. The Administration of Parliament Act does not also provide for that. As far as the law is concerned, anyone posing as a deputy; deputy one, two or three, under the Constitution are imposters. 

Madam Speaker, I need guidance from you again to help Parliament not to be taken to court. When you called the Prime Minister who is appointed under the Constitution - and you read the relevant Act – I do not know whether you meant someone who is appointed under no law.

THE SPEAKER: Do you want to tell me that the first, second and third deputy prime ministers are not appointed under a law, yet you approved them in the same House?

MR SSEMUJU: Madam Speaker, Parliament has in the past made mistakes and those mistakes have been taken to court. I have personally gone to court and the court has ruled in my favour.

I am bringing this in good faith, Madam Speaker - that maybe in future, since you are our leader - in the past, these one, two, three used to be for ministries, such as the Minister for Wildlife and Antiquities. They used to give them ministries so that they do not hang in the air. These particular ones have been given no ministry; they are hanging in air. It is for their own good.

Madam Speaker, the Constitution recognises the Prime Minister. The Administration of Parliament Act also recognises the Prime Minister and Leader of Government Business. I am actually helping them. They should be happy that someone gave them a kiwani assignment. (Laughter)

THE SPEAKER: What is kiwani? 

MR SSEMUJU: Madam Speaker, “non-existent”.

THE SPEAKER: “Non-existent assignment” would mean they are not doing anything. The Prime Minister-designate is here and she is performing her role. You have even thanked her for doing the work. I do not see any harm in that. Just like you have the Deputy Chief Opposition Whip, which is not provided for, but you have a Deputy Chief Opposition Whip.

MS OPENDI: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Rule 157(3) states: “Except as provided by these Rules in respect to the Business Committee, Appointments Committee and the Budget Committee, a Member shall not belong to more than two Committees.” 

Madam Speaker, the Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation was initially a sectoral committee, and later turned into a standing committee. However, there are Members who are members of other standing committees, and now also, belong to this sectoral committee. 

Madam Speaker, that is against our rule. The procedural issue I want to raise is that Members cannot belong to two standing committees, except those provided for, which is the Budget Committee, Appointments Committee and the Business Committee.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Sarah, there was an amendment on the Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation, which was passed in this House. The amendment was proposed by the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline and it is awaiting gazettement. We are, yet to gazette it to be operationalised. Before gazettement, it cannot be operationalised. Wait for the gazette - that is why I said we would designate later, once it has been gazetted. 

Honourable members, I would like to thank you for today. I am not going to be sitting in the House like the world is ending tomorrow. I am adjourning the House to 2.00 p.m. tomorrow.
 
(The House rose at 4.54 p.m. and adjourned until Wednesday, 6 July 2022 at 2.00 p.m.)
