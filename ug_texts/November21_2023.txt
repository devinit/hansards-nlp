PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES(HANSARD)OFFICIAL REPORTTHIRD SESSION - SECOND MEETINGTUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA10986TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGATuesday, 21 November 2023I have been checking through the  Hansard  and I saw two major aspects that can define her; she always fought for the marginalised and she was always passionate about fighting against corruption. One of the most interesting ones was the Hansard  of 6 April 1999, where they were considering a report of a select committee on affairs of the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry, and Fisheries; she had very strong words for the corrupt. She pushed to ensure that the underprivileged are, indeed, considered in whatever Government was doing. On a personal note, I extend condolences to my brother, David Mpanga, who has been a personal friend for some time and I happen to be his client for some good years. I never had a chance to meet Owekitiibwa Joyce, but at least I am very satisfied that through Mr David Mpanga, I have met her. This is because if you bring up a child of that stature and character, I am sure that child would have been learning from such a character. A few days ago, they celebrated 20 years of their law firm’s existence; AF Mpanga Advocates. He called me and gave me this book, “The Great African Story”,  which documents the journey of their law firm. You could see that he was showing how the family - the mother - had brought him up and the very rare character she inculcated in him and the whole family, to the extent of knowing that professionalism is above everything; above money. This is the true depiction of Hon. Joyce Mpanga. IN THE PARLIAMENT OF UGANDAOfficial Report of the Proceedings of ParliamentTHIRD SESSION - SPECIAL SITTING - SECOND MEETINGParliament met at 2.13 p.m. in Parliament House, Kampala.PRAYERS(The Deputy Speaker, Mr Thomas Tayebwa, in the Chair.)The House was called to order.COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRTHE DEPUTY SPEAKER : Honourable colleagues, I welcome you to today’s special sitting. It is a very sad day for us but also a day, indeed, on which we celebrate one of our greatest icons as a country. Today’s sitting is entirely dedicated to paying tribute to the late Hon. Joyce Mpanga; a former Minister for Women Affairs and former Minister of State for Primary Education. She also served as a Member of Parliament representing Mubende District having been the first woman to join the Legislative Council (LEGCO) in 1960.She was also a serving member of the Lukiiko of Buganda Kingdom. She has been one of the few living Ugandans who have witnessed Uganda’s history from colonialism to the present day. She was also a Fulbright Foreign Student Programme Alumni of Indiana University. Her participation as the first Ugandan woman inspired many young women to go to school at a time when society was mainly promoting boy-child education. 10987THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023I continue to extend my condolences to the rest of the family, the country, the Kabaka  of Buganda, and to His Excellency the President. I really thank him for granting an official burial; this is a deserving one. (Applause)  Honourable colleagues, when you read through the Hansard  - it will probably guide us in our submissions in the House. If the unfortunate happens and that day comes, we should not be struggling to define you. We should not be struggling to say, “Now, how do I speak about this one?” For instance, you start struggling for words with a colleague you have been with for 10 or 15 years in the House. That is why I always remind us that we should always go back to the Hansard  and look at our senior people; our elders and how they used to submit on some of the critical issues in society. This was very easy for me who never had a chance to meet Hon. Joyce Mpanga. When I read through the Hansard , it gave me a true picture of what an astute legislator she was and the most critical issues she espoused as a person. I also bring condolences from the Rt Hon. Speaker of Parliament to you, Mr David Mpanga. I had to ensure that I register her personal condolences to you and the whole family. With those, honourable colleagues, in the public gallery, this afternoon - I am receiving condolences here. I have received one from Hon. Migadde Robert Ndugwa, the Chairperson of Buganda NRM Parliamentary Caucus. It is registered; NRM has its caucus in Buganda. Honourable colleagues, on the technical - the late Hon. Joyce Mpanga never used to react that way so we better go back and know how she - Today is her day. Let us at least reflect her image here. Honourable colleagues, on the technical bench this afternoon, we have immediate family members: 1. Mrs Naomi Hamilton - Sister to the late; 2. Dr Florence Kasirye; - Sister to the late; 3. Owekitiibwa  David Mpanga - Son; 4. Dr Phiona Mpanga - Daughter-in-law; 5. Dr Jeff Sebuyira-Mukasa - Son-in-law; 6. Dr Lydia Mpanga Sebuyira-Mukasa – Daughter; and 7. Mr Peter Walusimbi Mpanga - Son. I think you can hear the honors when they are being introduced. We have to do much, honourable colleagues. They have come to join us as we pay tribute to their late mother, sister and friend. Please, join me in welcoming them once again. (Applause)(Entrance of the late Hon. Joyce Rovincer Mpanga.)The National AnthemThe East African Community AnthemLaying of wreathsTHE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Honourable colleagues, record these wreaths with the Office of the Clerk. It is not that we just think about all regions; you have parliamentary groups. Therefore, if Sebei Region has not registered, next time, I do not want us to exhibit what I have seen here. It is not good, especially on such a day. Leaders of the different parliamentary associations should ensure that you register with the Clerk if you have a wreath. If you do not want to lay a wreath, the Clerk will not force it unto you. Next item – MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT TO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON.

Is the motion seconded? (Members rose_) It is seconded by the Leader of the Opposition, Hon. Muyingo, Hon. Namuganza, Hon. Cecilia Ogwal, Hon. Basalirwa, Hon. Namuyangu -  there are colleagues she had in the House -  Hon. Kabasharira, Hon. Abubaker Kawalya, Hon. Kalwanga, Hon. Ecweru, the Government Chief Whip, Hon. Bahati, Hon. Chemaswet and the whole House.  Rt Hon. Prime Minister, would you like to speak to your motion?MS NAKADAMA:  Mr Speaker, on 18 November 2023, the country received the sad news of the passing on of Hon. Joyce Rovincer Mpanga who was a renowned Educationist, Women Rights Activist, Community Worker and Veteran Politician among the few outstanding women who served in the Legislative Council (LEGCO). Hon. Joyce Rovincer Mpanga was born on 22 January 1933 in Kassanda District, which was by then part of the Greater Mubende District. She attended Ndejje High School, which was later demoted to Nalinya Lwantale Primary School. She then later transferred to Gayaza High School in 1946 where she also served as a Head Girl.In 1958, she graduated from Makerere College University, the present day Makerere University where she was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree having studied History, Geography and English. She later went to the University of London for a Bachelor of Arts and Indiana University Bloomington for her Masters of Science in 1962.The late Hon. Joyce Rovincer Mpanga became the third girl in East Africa to attain a University degree and the first Ugandan woman to win a US Fulbright Scholarship. This inspired many young females to strive for admission at Makerere University and later thought of affirmative action at public universities. She began her professional career in the education sector as a teacher at Makerere College School and later also served as a Deputy Headmistress of Gayaza High School in 1962.After the National Resistance Movement took over Government in 1986, Hon. Joyce Rovincer Mpanga became Uganda’s first Minister of Women in Development in 1988 and then State Minister for Primary Education until 1991. In 1996, Hon. Joyce Mpanga contested for Member of Parliament and won to represent the people of Mubende District. She served her people with dedication during her term from 1996 to 2001. She was a dedicated leader, an advocate of women equality who diligently served her country. Her enduring dedication to public service was further evident in her role as a member of the Buganda Kingdom Lukiiko , where she continued to advocate for the interests of her community. In 2019, she authored a book titled “It’ s a Pity She’ s Not a Boy”  in which she came out strongly to inspire rural girls, emphasising that their aspirations hold immense value, irrespective of their humble beginnings. This showed unwavering commitment to empowering young women and girls to better citizens. She also served as an executive board member of the National Council of Women, as a founding member of Uganda Women’s Efforts to Save Orphans (UWESO) and as a chairperson of the NGO Board.The late Joyce Mpanga was a wife to Andrew Fredrick Mpanga, who by the time of their marriage in 1965, was the Attorney-General of Buganda under Kabaka  Mutesa II. She was the mother to lawyer and author, David Fredrick Kisitu Mpanga, Peter Mpanga, a former Private Secretary to the Kabaka , George Mpanga, a poet podcast living in the United Kingdom, and Lydia Anne Zawedde Nabitalo Mpanga Sebuyira, an Assistant Professor at the University of Washington. Other children include; Naava Eva Naluyimba, Stephen Wasswa Mpanga, Grace Joyce Nakato Mutesasira, Edward Wasswa Ssenoga Mpanga and Michael Kato Mpanga.We extend our sincere sympathies and deep condolences to the family, relatives and the country at large. May her soul rest in eternal peace. I beg to submit.10990TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGA2.58THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Mr Mathias Mpuuga):  Much obliged, Mr Speaker. I join the Rt Hon. Prime Minister in seconding the motion paying tribute to the late Hon. Joyce Rovincer Mpanga. Mr Speaker, I like your choice of words in the preamble of your communication to the effect that, “this is very deserving.” Of course, the Speaker has been around long enough to know that “deserving” has qualifications, and therefore, some people are more deserving than others. I join you in that agreement that, actually, this was very deserving. We are here today to pay tribute to an astute leader, Hon. Joyce Rovincer Masembe Mpanga who has diligently served this nation in all the portfolios she held. On behalf of my family and the Opposition in Parliament, I condole with the family and the rest of the country for the loss of Hon. Joyce Rovincer Mpanga. For her legacy and great contribution to our nation, the Opposition in Parliament has elected to momentarily return to the House for this special sitting, given her strong advocacy and impeccable record in the realm of rule of law and respect for human rights and freedoms. I have used the word, “momentarily” on purpose because there after, we shall safely return to our clean bunkers until further notice.The country mourns a spirited patriot, a mother and an incorruptible leader who dedicated all her life prioritising the interests of the people. She has been known as a “Woman of Many Firsts” and her accomplishments, well enumerated, have inspired many in the academic world and governance. She has been a renowned champion for women’s rights; one of the first women to be nominated to the Uganda National Assembly, LEGCO, as known then in 1950; first African woman lecturer in the Faculty of Education at Makerere University; first female graduate with a Master’s degree; first Minister of Women’s Affairs in Uganda; and first female Minister for Primary Education in Uganda, and Gayaza High School’s first African Deputy Headmistress.Hon. Joyce Mpanga’s contribution to Uganda’s education sector and development cannot be discounted. She has served in different capacities in the education sector rising from a classroom teacher to become a minister. She used this time and space to advocate for, specifically, girl-child education. We shall remember her candid advisory to Mr Museveni on the management of the sector; to it, the management of the Universal Primary Education and also the appointment of Mrs Janet Museveni as the Minister of Education and Sports, and of course, the non-regulation of school fees in private schools.Owing to the decline in the rule of law, which characterised the post-Independence era, Hon. Mpanga left for England in exile a year after the 1966 attack on the Lubiri and only returned to Uganda in 1972. While in exile, she switched back to her career as an elementary school teacher.Hon. Mpanga, in her memoir titled, “It’ s A Pity She’ s Not a Boy”  recounts the impunity that consumed and engulfed the 1970s regimes and how politicians often got drunk with power at the expense of the people they served. I encourage you, Mr Speaker and Members of Parliament, to fall in love with reading; not to read history for the sake of passing exams, but for knowledge as they are at the service of alma mater . She writes about a military officer who was the finance minister at the time, with all the powers to authorise foreign currency exchange. She was in dire need of forex to evacuate her husband, the former Attorney-General of Buganda, Mr Fredrick Mpanga, for specialised treatment. The minister, unfortunately, summarily declined the application, and a few months later, Mr Mpanga passed on. It is such injustices that motivated some individuals to take up arms under the guise of liberating the nation in the 1980s. 10991THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023In that regard, the deceased has been a key pillar in the process of democratising Uganda. Sadly, like many, as we speak today, all efforts to democratise our country are being undermined by the incumbent rulers, through unconscionable amendments to the Constitution, impunity and outright disregard of the rule of law. Mr Speaker, I want to remind you of some of the crucial things that prompted Hon. Mpanga to flee to exile are in existence today; the enforced disappearance of people, political persecution and gross human rights violations, which have again forced our countrymen and women to flee for safety. Until we address some of these issues to democratise our country, it is not yet uhuru . We recognise this gallant daughter of our motherland for her invaluable contribution to the restoration of traditional institutions. She will be remembered for her selfless service to His Majesty the Kabaka  and the people of Uganda. I am a beneficiary of her mentorship. The best form of mentorship is by role modelling; you do not need a board in front of you. To some of us loyal servants of His Majesty, she was a role model. People like Hon. Muyingo with whom we served will attest to the fact that she was loyal and we owe her. Mr Speaker, as I conclude, I applaud her as a mother for taking care of her children. She is not leaving behind a problem to the nation, but rather, very diligent servicemen and women of this motherland. We appreciate her. May the soul of our beloved mother, Hon. Joyce Rovincer Mpanga, rest in eternity. We stand with the family in this moment of agony, His Majesty the Kabaka, where she served as a Lukiiko  member, and the nation at large for this great loss. I beg to submit. THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, the Leader of the Opposition. Hon. Mushemeza, will represent the Dean of Independents. 3.07PROF. ELIJAH MUSHEMEZA (Independent, Sheema County South, Sheema ): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I support the motion to pay tribute to the late Hon. Mpanga. I have known her for many years but I am going to pay tribute focusing on only three areas. The first one is in the area of gender equality and women’s empowerment. The late Hon. Mpanga made a fundamental contribution in formulating the National Gender Policy. I remember very well that she was particular on the issue of gender mainstreaming. As we pay tribute to her, we need to reflect on how far we have gone on the issue of gender mainstreaming. How are we performing on the issue of gender-responsive budgeting? The second area is education. I also recall that she contributed to the education policy and at that time, the review that led to the popular 1992 Government White Paper on Education. Right now, there is a process going on, on reviewing education but this is the time to remember the late Mpanga and I believe if she was still alive, even in her old age, she would still contribute to the on-going education review. The third area is integrity. Mr Speaker, from what I observe, we are about to lose the war on corruption. The late Mpanga was a person of integrity, who did not engage in corrupt practices. I suggest that the three arms of Government could have a caucus. I remember at the time of the term-limit debate, I suggested that the leaders of the three organs should caucus. This is because there was a debate on whether we should go for a referendum on term limits, yet the Constitution was clear that it should be handled by Parliament. My wise counsel at that time was accepted. I will again give wise counsel that the leadership of Parliament, Judiciary and the Executive have a caucus behind the scenes and talk about 10992TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGAthe issues of corruption. It is not enough to say “we are going to fight corruption.” We need to take the bull by its horns. May the soul of the late Hon. Mpanga rest in eternal peace. THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you.  Honourable colleagues, I am going to open up the debate. I will start with four people; Hon. Muyingo, then the two Members of Parliament who were with her, in Parliament. I know Hon. Cecilia Ogwal, Hon. Naome Kabasharira, and Hon. Namuyangu – I had forgotten. We will have the area Member of Parliament for where she has been, Hon. Abubaker Kawalya. I will then allow the rest. Honourable colleagues, I request that you are cautious of other colleagues who want to submit. I do not want to cut you off. The moment you go beyond; I will interrupt you. Hon. Muyingo? 3.12THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SPORTS (HIGHER EDUCATION) (Dr John Chrysostom Muyingo): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I stand here to support the motion to pay tribute to Owekitiibwa the late Joyce Rovincer Masembe Mpanga. The cruel hand of death has robbed this country of a distinguished educationist, a great parent to many, a teacher, a role model and a performer.As you may have heard from the Prime Minister, after she had completed her primary education in Nalinya Lwantale, which is in Luwero District, she went to Gayaza High School, where she was elected Head Girl for two consecutive years; this had not happened to anybody before. It was because of her great performance.Mr Speaker, she has been a role model to many of us in the education sector. She greatly contributed to many of the policies in the ministry of education. She wanted to see every child in Uganda of school-going age, go to school, stay there until one completes the education cycle.When you read what she has left behind, it is right that we recognise her as a distinguished educationist, parent and a great teacher who inspired many of us.I followed the late very closely, especially when she joined Ministry of Education and Sports. She always used Parliamentary language even after she had left Parliament.  I do not remember any single day when she used insulting or abusive words as it happens these days. We shall remember her as a distinguished educationist, a charitable person and a strong advocate of gender equality inclusivity, a pioneer of the affirmative action      interventions as you have heard in admitting female students at Makerere University and other universities as you can see now; those days, it was just one or two.Remember she was a member of the National Council of Women, which among others, lobbied Justice Benjamin Odoki’s Commission about women’s representation in Parliament and lower local government councils. Many of the ladies in this House should not take this lightly.  If it were not for her, life would have been very different.Mr Speaker, while we are all mourning, in a special way, I would like to extend my sincere condolences to Owekitiibwa  David Fredrick Kisitu Mpanga, your siblings and the entire family. May God protect and comfort you in this very trying moment. May her soul rest in eternal peace. For God and my country.THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, honourable.      3.16MS CECILIA OGWAL (FDC, Woman Representative, Dokolo): Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is very important that as women, we should appreciate this session because it has allowed us to appreciate the role a woman can play if given an opportunity.[Mr Mushemeza]10993THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023While I pass my condolences to the family of Hon. Joyce Mpanga, I would like to let you know that the whole of Africa is mourning the daughter of Uganda who has fallen asleep and whose memory has brought us here today. The casket before us is of our dear sister, friend, freedom fighter, dedicated wife, a widow who can feed orphans without begging any     one   and a woman who has demonstrated that if you give me education, I can do anything over and above what a man can do.      This is the lady before us. (Applause)        She was an educationist, a politician, a philosopher – I have thought of words –  My naughty son, Hon. Muwanga Kivumbi, asked me whether I was going to speak in English or Luo. I said try to understand what I will say, do not care how I have said it. I hope   he is catching up.Hon. Joyce Mpanga left Uganda in tears but also left Africa feeling the sense of loss. Her role in the liberation struggle in the early days when women’s role was purely in the kitchen and giving birth, that was the time Hon. Joyce stood up. The whole of Africa is mourning with Uganda this great lady called Hon. Joyce Mpanga. As you know, I am the Chairperson of the Ugandan Chapter of the Pan-African Women Organisation.It is important for you to know that Pan-African Women Organisation (PAWO) came into existence before the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). Before the African Union was formed, the women of Africa came together, including Hon. Joyce Mpanga and some of our great women of Uganda, stood together and they gave birth to PAWO in 1962 before OAU was formed in 1963. Really, how can you forget Hon. Joyce Mpanga?Mr Speaker, I have heard from the Prime Minister that Hon. Joyce was the first woman to be elected to LEGCO or Joyce was the first woman to represent women in the LEGCO. All of us must re-read the Hansard  and our history. My understanding is that Joyce was elected in 1960 when LEGCO was elected in 1957 or 1958 although the process started in 1957. The LEGCO was already established in 1958 and women were there. You know very well that our own daughter, Florence Lubega, was one of the ladies by election in that LEGCO. I just want us to understand a little better because – That is why when the Government is celebrating the heroes of Uganda, they forget these giant heroes. These are heroes beyond heroes who should be remembered before you think of anybody else. (Applause)When you talk about the heroes in Uganda, I urge the      Government to remember those women who were bashed by the tradition and culture they suffered. Today, all we are asking you is to remember them and the roles they played. They are not begging for anything.Now, somebody is saying, Joyce would have participated in the formation of policies. Joyce just died yesterday, how many times did you call her to consult on anything in the development of either women’s agenda or anything? She was an outstanding intellectual. Why didn’t you call her?     In the gallery, we have the “Buteles”, Yona Kanyomozi died an outstanding Economist and nobody called him to make a contribution. Let us wake up as Ugandans and use our own resources before we go out to look for Europeans. (Applause) Therefore, Joyce, forgive them for they do not know what they are doing. (Laughter)I would like to enrich your history. Some of you look at us with a lot of envy and say, this is one of the longest serving women in Parliament, you think it is something to enjoy, it is not. It is a journey of pain. If you are really a woman, it is not business as usual. It is a journey of pain. (Applause)It is a journey when your husband has demands on you, when the children have demands on you, when a fellow woman is fighting you, when everybody is against you; but you have to stand up and prove you are stronger than the men who are fighting you.10994TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGAThank you, Joyce –(Interjection) -  yes, even the co-wives are fighting you –(Laughter)- and the step children are fighting you, including those whose DNA may not match their husband’s. (Laughter)Mr Speaker, forgive me for being emotional but the death of Hon. Joyce has triggered something unusual in me. I would like to remind you that before Hon. Joyce entered Parliament to join her sister Florence Alice Lubega, an Irish-born Lady called Boyce and an Indian-born lady who was my name sake, Dorothy Barbra Sabinn, were representatives for women in LEGCO, prior to the election of 1958. We were represented by foreigners - as you, Mr Speaker, bring some Europeans and Americans here and talk about the gender or policies that Hon. Joyce and others worked for, what would be their contribution? That is the history of Uganda and the girl-child. We were represented in the legislature by foreigners, until eventually, “slowly-slowly”, even by nomination, people joined in.I am not here to talk about the usual that you people have talked about or the Government has got from Google record but we are celebrating the role played by our own Ugandan daughter in the legislature. Hon. Joyce did a lot although she was not so much of a loud talker. She did a lot and used that quiet and confident character of hers to push a lot for this country, not only for women but for the entire education system, as the Minister has just shared with us.I would like to let you know that apart from Hon. Joyce playing a role in the politics of Uganda, it is amazing that the struggle for the liberation of Africa, a young girl at her age got involved.And, some unthinkable young girls got involved very vigorously and made sure that the PAWO was established and drove the affairs of the liberation struggle from the front of women, leaving the men still fighting, “who will be our Chairperson if we come together as the Organisation of African Union (OAU).” Allow me to read, just a few names which some of you may want to reflect one of these days. The mothers of Africa: 1.  Bibi Titi Mohamed of Tanzania, I am sure many of you have read about her.2.  Jeanne Martin Cisse of Guinea, who was the first Secretary General of PAWO. 3.  Ruth Neto of Angola.4.  Aoua Keita of Mali5.  Pumla Kisosonkole of Uganda, whom many people thought was a Ugandan but later on, when you look deeper, you find that she was from a South African origin. 6. Rebecca Mulira, our own Ugandan.7. Margaret Mambui Kenyatta, the daughter of President Jomo Kenyatta.8. Joyce Mpanga, our own, please, even when we are mourning, clap for her. She was number eight on the list of the founder mothers of PAWO.9. Fatia Bettahar from Algeria.10. Likimani Muthoni, writer and journalist from Kenya. You have all read her book. “My Blood is Not on Sale” .11. Phoebe Asiyo, former member of Parliament from Kenya and also member of the LEGCO then, before independence.12. Albertina Sisulu from South Africa, freedom fighter.13. Maria Nyerere, our own from Tanzania and several others. These are the founder mothers - and if you have any differences with Hon. Joyce Mpanga, the children have repented. Some of us the [Ms Ogwal]10995THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023women who are still alive will repent but, please, always remember Hon. Joyce Mpanga and her team who did not only fight for the liberation of Africa, not only holistically but also to liberate women.Always remember the role that Maama  Mpanga has played. (Applause) That is what I am begging of you. Along with other women, they converged in Addis Ababa in 2018 together with one of the daughters. I do not know whether she is around-that daughter accompanied the mother in 2018 to revive the activities of PAWO in Africa so that we can become vibrant again and stop the guns, which are raging all over Africa. That was the role that Hon. Joyce Mpanga played recently in 2018, to make sure that we start a new programme of how we can silence guns in Africa and start the journey for development and unity. Now that she has entered the casket, though many of us would not want and I am sure that if we were to ask the family members, they would have said, “she could have waited for may be another one or two months” but the issue is, she would have to entered anyway. Now that we have agreed with God that she has entered the casket and she is going, what message would she leave us with? This is our challenge now, how do we remember Hon. Joyce as an educationist, pioneer women mobiliser, a distinguished teacher? I would want you to remember that Hon. Joyce Mpanga, the husband dying and leaving her young but she was able to rear those children, whose names were read.You ask yourself, Mr Speaker, you are young, God forbid, if your wife were to leave, let us just pray that it does not happen, I am giving an example. Young as you are or my son Hon. David here, the wife decides to go and we wait for 20 or 30 years and we say; now give us your accountability; you will hear, he married this one then left two children. (Laughter)   I am saying this, because I want the Ministry of Education to stand up to the call we are making today. Let us increase the budget on girl-child education. (Applause)Hon. Joyce has been able to prove that when you educate a girl, you educate the community and the entire country. Her children did not put a burden on the family of anyone. They did not put a burden on the Government, the mother was able to stand up and provide for the family and the children. That is a commendable message, which she has left with us, the women. So, we must walk in her footsteps. Thank you, Maama  Joyce, for what you have done as a widow; you have left us a very rich history. You have not left shame on the children. You do not have to explain, “This one, my half-brother - You know, after my father died, something happened - I do not know but then this – Mr Speaker, I am here to conclude; I did not know that I stepped on a live wire. (Laughter)  Take it or leave it, fellow mourners, the title of the book of our dear sister here is, “It’ s A Pity She’ s Not a Boy.”  However, I would like us to change that story today and I wish the family could agree that the second edition must start today. It is a blessing that Hon. Joyce Mpanga was born a girl; that is the message I leave here today. Mr Speaker, whether you want to endorse it or not, I have spoken and it is recorded in Parliament. (Applause)My dear family, I stand with you at this moment. We celebrate the life of our sister. We are not mourning; we are celebrating her rich life and hope the Lord God will lead us in that path which is difficult to walk but we will all try. May God bless you all. (Applause)   THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Honourable colleagues, you have seen why we needed to give our Mama  enough time. If you seriously listened to her, you will notice that there are people we should look up to, but also look out for.10996TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGALast time, when I returned from visiting Mama  Rhoda Kalema, I asked you, honourable colleagues, to make arrangements and reach out to such people. I know if you talked to Hon. Akena, he would make some arrangements with Mama Miria Obote. My mother is in Mitooma. (Laughter)  It might be difficult for you to go there and come back for a parliamentary sitting so you can exclude her. We have people we know extremely well that played a critical role and from whom we can learn a lot. To be honest, sometimes these people are lonely. They want to speak to us but cannot reach us. They cannot come to Parliament to look for us. Sometimes, they want to speak to us or for us to even write to them, by the way. I saw Father Grimes saying – I mean, he is looking out for letters; simply hearing from you. Above all, we would learn a lot from such people. Therefore, I encourage you, honourable colleagues, to do so. I usually move around - Most of the people who read books carry foreign ones. When you read the books of such people, you will discover that they are great. I encourage you - Mama  Cecilia Ogwal, thank you very much. I appreciate you and associate myself with the statements that you have made here. (Applause)Hon. Namuyangu and then Hon. Naome Kabasharira. Honourable colleagues, you do not have that privilege of Mama  Cecilia Ogwal. (Laughter)3.35THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER (BUNYORO AFFAIRS) (Ms Jenipher Namuyangu): Thank you, Mr Speaker. On behalf of the people of Kibuku and Bunyoro where I am deployed as a minister, I register our heartfelt condolences to the family and country for the loss of yet another great daughter of Africa. (Applause)When I joined Parliament as one of the first Youth MPs, I had the opportunity to work with great women like Hon. Mpanga. She was a diligent worker, soft spoken and very principled. At that time, we used to have a forum where all the women legislators would come together regularly and have these great women talk to us. They would mentor us and Hon. Joyce Mpanga was one of them. They would not leave you the same, as a young legislator. Hon. Mpanga was an advocate for gender equality, but we also learned a lot from her on her education journey from a classroom teacher to a minister. As a minister, she advocated a lot for the girl-child. It was during that time, guided by the President, Gen. Yoweri Museveni, that the girl-child was given additional points to join the university. (Applause)We were spot-on, as women leaders, in mobilising the girl-child and boy-child to stay in school and complete their education. It is very unfortunate that we have lost her.At that time, women like Hon. Mpanga, Hon. Miria Matembe, Her Excellency, Dr Kazibwe, Hon. Cecilia Ogwal, Hon. Janat Mukwaya, Hon. Victoria Ssekitoleko and Hon. Rhoda Kalema, among others, would talk to us.I pray, Rt Hon. Prime Minister, that we have such a fora for women to come and engage each other. We have the Uganda Women Parliamentary Association (UWOPA) but that is not enough because not all women are within UWOPA – (Interjections) - Yes. They would even bring men to talk to us, in terms of mentoring and taking care of our families. I can assure you that at that time, we did not have broken families because they would mentor us about our families, how to maintain the constituencies and how to serve the country.Indeed, I can confirm that Hon. Joyce Mpanga was one of the transparent leaders at the time. We shall miss her and all we can say is that we need to emulate such women so that we carry forward what they started.To the family, I salute you. Again, we have a lot to learn from a young widow who was able to educate all her children to become very [The Deputy Speaker]10997THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023responsible people who have added a building block to the country.Mr Speaker, may the good Lord sustain the family of our bereaved sister. Thank you. (Applause)THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Hon. Namuyangu has been in Parliament since the National Resistance Council and is getting younger every day that passes by. You need to speak to us on how you sustain yourself and the constituency. Hon. Naome Kabasharira -3.41MS NAOME KABASHARIRA (Indepen -dent, Rushenyi County, Ntungamo): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me this chance to talk about this iconic woman. I learnt about Hon. Joyce Mpanga’s death when I was in the constituency. When I came back on Monday, I waited for the programme to see whether she would be brought to Parliament for us to have a chance to speak about her but it did not come. I then asked, “What is happening?” Last night, I saw that she would be brought here and it became clear this morning that we shall talk about her.I thank the President for giving us this chance to bring her to Parliament so that her death is honoured and for her to be recognised as an important person in this country.Mr Speaker, you said it well that you read in the Hansard about what she did. You knew about her through her son but I had the chance to interact with her physically and work with her closely in this august House. I must say that I benefited a lot, like the previous speaker, Hon. Jennifer, said, because she mentored us. She was the founder of the Uganda Women Parliamentary Association (UWOPA) and at that time, we would meet regularly as women and for us who were young, they would mentor us. At one time, she called me aside because I came while young - I was not a youth representative but I was representing Ntungamo as the first Woman Member of Parliament, after school. I think they would look at us and say, these girls need to be given good direction, living with these old men. They were very protective. One time she called me and gave me a good - She was soft-spoken but to the point and you would take her word once she talked to you. She told me, “Now it is time that you think about getting married but be careful. Look for the right person because when you are in politics, it is difficult at times for these men to look at you but depending on how you handle yourself, you will manage. When you get there, you should learn how to balance politics and family so that you do not lose out. If you do not do it properly, you might lose one or both, but one mainly.” I attribute that to her as a person who was fighting for girls. In her book, “ It’ s a Pity She’ s Not a Boy” , she talks about how women are regarded in public, even today. If you were bright and sharp like her, people would say, I wish the father had gotten a boy, as if when you are a woman, you cannot perform like a man. They always say, I wish she was a boy. I think, in her book, she wanted to tell us that women can do better in whatever area they are in. She ably practised it because she was the first in everything and she managed. She fought very hard for other women to emulate her. She stood as a Constituent Assembly (CA) delegate in Mubende, but she went into the constituency, which you people have called men’s constituencies. She was asked, “Why are you going for -” Even when I stood, people were asking me, “Why are you standing in a man’s position?” I asked them, “Which one?” The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda gives me the mandate to stand anywhere. Hon. Mpanga faced it in the CA. Because they were looking at her as a woman, they did not give her the vote. We missed having her in the CA just because of that. She was even doing better at that time but people could not recognise her history of how she had performed. 10998TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGAThey did not allow her to come to the CA yet she would have contributed a lot, if she had been there. That took her back to Mubende to come as a Member of Parliament in the Sixth Parliament. Much as she was in the National Resistance Council (NRC), they never voted for her in the CA, so she came as a Woman Member of Parliament through affirmative action. I do not think that the person they sent performed better. If she had been there, she would have done it better –(Interjection)- Yes, I mean what I say. Hon. Mpanga has left a legacy of success in the public arena and in her family for all of us women to emulate. When you listen to what the elder, Hon. Cecilia Ogwal, said, Hon. Mpanga proved that women’s political and public participation does not lead to failure in family and private life because she took care of her family as a single woman; a widow. As you ably said, there is a renowned lawyer called David Mpanga and this is a legacy that we cannot just rubbish. She mentored us when we were still young. In her book, she explains the position that women are taking in this country and I wish that to remember her, we try hard, as women, to mentor the young ones so that we have as many women in politics as we can. I also want to say that the coming motion which talks about one woman and one man to come and represent should be accepted by this Parliament so that we downsize, but cater for a woman and a man. I would like to extend my sincere condolences to the family, the country and the President for losing such an important person. I beg to support the motion. Thank you. THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Honourable colleagues, we have just a few colleagues who were with her as Members of Parliament in 1996. No, I mean in Parliament. We have not yet recorded your work outside Parliament. Otherwise, very many worked with Mama . Therefore, I am referring to those who were with her in Parliament from 1996 to 2001. We have Hon. Janet Okori-Moe and Hon. Kwizera in 1996 - 3.51MS JANET OKORI-MOE (NRM, Woman Representative, Abim): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I pay tribute to a great lady, a celebrated educationist, a mother and a mentor. I was privileged, like my colleagues Hon. Kabasharira and Hon. Namuyangu, to serve with her in the Sixth Parliament. Although we keep serving; getting out and coming back –(Laughter) - we have to remain relevant. I benefited a lot from the late Hon. Joyce Mpanga. When we came to this Parliament as young ladies, it was not as rosy as it is now. Parliament was restricted to plenary. The other side where the Speakers sit was for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs. The Speakers then used to sit where the accountants are seated now. There was no lift, nothing like MPs’ offices and there was no canteen. If I talk about the salary, you will cry. However, she taught us good mannerisms of how to behave when you are a Member of Parliament and how to interact with the elderly Members of Parliament. She was cool-headed. When you see some of us cool-headed even in situations where there are provocations, it is because of her mentorship. (Applause)  Indeed, as my honourable colleagues have said, the elderly women who we found in the Sixth Parliament mentored us. While she was talking about women’s emancipation and good mannerisms, Hon. Matembe told us about being assertive and fighting for women’s rights. The former Vice President, Dr Wandera Kazibwe, taught us personal hygiene and group dynamics; how you are supposed to conduct yourself when you are in a group. The other women also taught us many things. [Ms Kabasharira]10999THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023Hon. Margaret Zziwa taught us girl guiding. We had a Girl Guides Association in this Parliament because a number of us were young. By then, we were only 39 women representatives and the country had only 39 districts. The late was representing Mubende and I was representing Kotido, which is the current Abim, Kaabong, Karenga and Kotido. It was such a large district. I am getting tempted - In the future when that amendment by my sister comes, we need to look at it. We have lost a great lady, a great mentor, a great educationist, a widow who stood on her own and did not leave behind shame. She has died at a time when we needed her most. We needed her as our dictionary to take us through and tell us more about harmonious living. We have lost you, my elder sister. Condolences to the family. May your soul rest in eternal peace. (Applause)THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you. Honourable colleagues, in the public gallery this afternoon, we have family members of the late Hon. Joyce Mpanga. They include: 1. Ms Grace Mpanga Mutesasira – Daughter 2. Ms Naava Eva Mpanga – Daughter 3. Mr Dennis Paul Kawuma – Nephew 4. Mr Bwogi Kawalya Kanyerezi – Nephew5. Mr Geoffrey Zziwa – Nephew 6. Mr Fred Magandazi Chwa – Nephew 7. Ms Namuddu Musoke Kireka – Niece 8. Mr Kenneth Kireka – In-law 9. Mr Fred Sospa Kaweesa –  In-law  10. Ms Adalina Rubugo – In-law  11. Ms Ansela Vategenya – In-law  12. Mr Simeon Kawanzi – First cousin Please join me, once again, in welcoming them. (Applause)In the public gallery this afternoon, we also have pupils and teachers of Mother Care Preparatory School from Wakiso District. They are represented by Hon. David Sserukenya and Hon. Betty Naluyima. On a special note, we have one of our daughters, Melan Namirimu, the daughter to Hon. Helen Nakimuli, Woman Member of Parliament, Kalangala. We would like to recognise you. Please stand up for recognition. Thank you. As you can see, some of us are already training potential replacements. (Laughter)  3.58MR ABUBAKER KAWALYA (NUP, Rubaga Division North, Kampala):  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I stand here to support the motion to pay tribute to the late Joyce Mpanga. I am speaking as the area Member of Parliament but at the same time, as someone who has lost a sister or an aunt. I come from the Nsenene clan where she also subscribed. The late had time for the young generation, as we have heard good things spoken about her. What I remember about her is the time she created for the young generation. When I was a student at Makerere University, we would always invite her for most of the public lectures. She encouraged us on matters of leadership, most especially the involvement of ladies in politics. It is unfortunate, Mr Speaker, that as we speak, the Committee on Presidential Affairs is handling a matter where some of our Women MPs were manhandled by the security agencies that work at Parliament. She always protected the girl-child and I have heard some of her colleagues speaking on how she was very tough when it came to the protection of women’s rights. My question for those who served with her is, do you have time to mentor the young leaders that we have in Parliament? We have heard complaints that those who served with her do not have time to mentor the young generation. 11000TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGAAs residents of Rubaga, we have lost a nationalist. The Anglican Church has lost a serious citizen, most especially those who come from Lungujja where she has been praying at St Stephen’s Church. The people of Uganda are mourning, most especially those who agitate for the rights of women. We have lost a true leader who always stood by her words. Members, we are in a generation where we have had elderly leaders change their words. Today they say this, tomorrow they say a different thing. We have heard people say that she always watched her words. The question is, do we always stand by our words, especially when it comes to the violation of human rights?The late served her kingdom very well and there is not a single day when she missed the Lukiiko , unless she was not in the country. She attended most public lectures, especially those that concern the rights of freedoms and protection of the girl-child. When it came to the rule of law, for a few of us who got time to sit with her, she always said, “My young boys, I know you are facing a lot of challenges but make sure that you do whatever it takes to fight for the Constitution.” The time she was serving as a Member of Parliament, when most of these laws were formulated - At least they knew that whatever was being done at that time was going to be maintained. However, are we maintaining what was formulated during their time? I am speaking this as her Member of Parliament who always had time to visit and learn a lot from her. Women emancipation was always on her lips and I am glad that the former Member of Parliament, Hon. Miria Matembe, is here. She is among the few leaders who have always stood to make sure that women’s rights are protected. (Applause)  We expect the elderly leaders in this House to do the same. Questions are always being asked in the public by the people of Uganda; “Do we have leaders who protect women’s rights?” Yes, I am one of the leaders in this Parliament who knows that I am going to serve for a certain period of time and I will go. As women leaders, do we always have time to mentor young leaders, most especially women? Or do we make sure that we protect ourselves in those positions that we are occupying right now? This is what I used to get from her. There is a day when we asked her, “What did you do to serve the people of Mubende so that you reached a time and said, I am not going to come back and contest?” She answered, “As leaders, you have your time but you should know one thing; that there are young people down there who are also ready to do what you are doing.” As the Member of Parliament who was serving her and at the same time as the shadow Minister for Kampala, I kindly request this august House to instruct Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA), where she has been residing, to gazette one of the roads in Kampala in respect of her service rendered to this country. May her soul rest in peace. Thank you. THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you. I thought you were also going to say, “I want to follow her example and serve one term and not offer myself again.” (Laughter) On the issue of mentorship, allow me to protect my colleagues. Mentorship is about you. You need to know that you need to be mentored. People will not look out for you. I know some of us are difficult to mentor.I have sent one Member of Parliament, who I knew needed mentorship, to Hon. Cecilia Ogwal. She attended one session and said, “I did not come to school, I already know it” and she took off. This is because Hon. Cecilia is demanding. She wants to see you in Parliament, and to see you preparing for a session.We do not want to be mentored. Ask these people - I do not know who has approached Hon. Katuntu, Hon. Janet, Hon. Kivumbi, Hon. Byarugaba and Hon. Namuyangu for mentorship.[Mr Kawalya]11001THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023Hon. Mwijukye has approached me for mentorship and I have done my part - (Laughter) - so honourable colleagues, it is very important - I hand the microphone to Hon. Ssemujju.4.07MR IBRAHIM SSEMUJJU (FDC, Kira Municipality, Wakiso):  Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me begin by extending my condolences to the family of the late Hon. Joyce Mpanga. At the beginning, our society glorified excellence. That is why the likes of Hon. Joyce Mpanga were able to make it to the top. I want to ask - I am not one of the supporters of affirmative action. I think people need to fight. For those who fought like the Mpangas, that is why they turned out the way they did.Affirmative action, especially once abused, opened the door to everybody. It ended up bringing kunkumula  politicians -(Interjection) We are paying tribute, there is no order. THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Hon. Ssemujju, you know the language we use here. For purposes of the Hansard , if you could just enable us to understand - MR SSEMUJJU:  Let me use the word that President Yoweri Museveni used. It brought fisherwomen. By empowering Hon. Joyce Mpanga -that is why she was able to raise people whose titles and education background we have all admired. Other people promote their children by appointment and military ranks. The Mpangas took their children to school and we now admire them. Mr Speaker, since you are our leader, my message is to tell those individuals who think that children can be promoted by military ranks and appointments and wives that they need to think about the alternatives that the parents of the Mpangas took. As we mourn our mother, look at the education sector today. I am glad that Hon. John Chrysostom Muyingo spoke because even elite people like Hon. John Chrysostom Muyingo - and that is why I keep blaming him, because I know he will not be offended. I remember in the Seventh Parliament, Col Tom Butime was appointed the Minister for Karamoja Affairs and he declined. I respect him. When you are educated, you must know what you can do and what you cannot. When I spoke about kunkumula  politicians, today you can be minister for fisheries, tomorrow they put you in garbage. As long as they have made you a minister, you do not care. However, Col Butime declined. It is also dehumanising to elevate you to a position where you cannot serve. Colleagues who are here, learn to decline. If they are asking you to punch above your weight, please say, “I am very sorry, I thank you very much, but I will not be in position to accept.” It is even more painful when you are being asked to be supervised by people that you know you should be supervising. Hon. JC Muyingo, you went to school - I am now referring to the late Mpanga - did this Master’s degree, brought senior two dropouts to be your supervisors and saluted them. We are here thanking her because she went to school. She was an educationist but she also loved excellence. That is why when you were talking about her children, you were all very happy. These shortcuts are the ones that are killing the country. I would like to say a few things before I sit. First, to thank the President for according her a state funeral. By the way, one of the things that he equitably gives are state funerals; they are official. On the other things, I refer you to the report of the Equal Opportunities Commission. These other things are dominated by others but on state funerals - The other day, we had Hon. Kyemba here and now we have Hon. Joyce Mpanga – (Interjections) - When we are mourning, you must also behave. Mr Speaker, I finally read The New Vision  today. Their editorial - and I am speaking from -11002TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGATHE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Honourable colleagues, when we are paying tribute, there are –(A Member rose_) -  We have a point of procedure which is different from a point of order. You have stood up to raise a procedural point and when I try to explain it to you, you have said, “This is order for all of us.” Those are two different points. We consider that because emotions come in but I know where we stop and I know I will guide very well. Hon. Ssemujju, conclude.MR SSEMUJJU:  Mr Speaker, you said we need to mentor young Members of Parliament. (Laughter)  I am finally referring to the editorial of The New Vision  today on the writing about Hon. Joyce Mpanga. It described her generation as people who did not chase after worldly things and made a call that in order to save this country, we need to return - I do not know why the NRM Members of Parliament are agitated. Do you want me to speak about you? We are speaking about Hon. Mpanga - THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Hon. Ssemujju, when you respond to people from the sides, you are bringing unofficial communication to the Hansard of Parliament. Ignore them because they are not on record. MR SSEMUJJU:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. The plea in The New Vision  editorial is that we need to return the country to the era of the Mpangas. That is why Prof. Mushemeza was speaking about corruption - Hon. Cecilia Ogwal is clapping. Therefore, that generation that glorified competence, excellence and did not pick people from the markets selling tomatoes, to begin laughing at them - This should concern everybody. Someone has appointed you to a very big position and is laughing at you. He says, “Leave my fisherman” and you are celebrating.I thank Hon. Joyce Mpanga and also ask the family to continue with her legacy. For those of us who are not members of the family, we admire you. There is a lot for us to learn from you. May her soul rest in eternal peace. THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. Hon. Akena -4.16MR JIMMY AKENA (UPC, Lira East Division, Lira City):  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise to support the motion to pay tribute to Hon. Joyce Mpanga. It is because of Hon. Joyce Mpanga that I am and I will qualify that statement. My maternal grandfather worked for the East African Railways and Harbours Corporation and he also believed in education. In the process of education, my mother went to Gayaza High School. As a small girl, she was mentored and taken under the wing of Joyce Mpanga. That mentorship did not begin late. It seems to be a character that Joyce Mpanga had throughout her life.There is a recent series of “Uganda at 60” where some historians tried to delve into the thoughts of those who were there at Independence. This story was given more light; it was Joyce Mpanga who took my mother to the Kololo Independence celebrations, since she was already involved in politics and had been a member of the LEGCO.Later on, under the wing of Joyce Mpanga, they went to Uganda Club where a lot of politics took place. It is from there that a man from Lango spotted a beautiful Muganda lady. Of course, that is the reason why I am here. (Applause)  That mentorship, like everybody has spoken, has gone on throughout her life. She always reached out to the weak and vulnerable. When my mother went to Gayaza, she was a small girl. Her father, being in the railways, was all over the place but Joyce Mpanga took her under her wing and did not forget her. Later in life, she was also there to mentor her; she brought her forward and introduced her to politics. In this series of “Uganda at 60”, there was a panel which involved Joyce Mpanga, my 11003THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023mother, and Dr Aliker. They talked about those in the pre-independence era and their thoughts on Independence.There was another panel for those who were born after Independence, where I had the great opportunity to feature with David Mpanga, the son of Musaazi and the son of Abu Mayanja. We also gave our thoughts and it became clear that a lot of politics has created some divisions. I have also noticed some people trying to bring them here as we pay tribute. However, I say that, I, Jimmy Akena, had the honour to host Joyce Mpanga on the day I swore in, in this 11th Parliament. (Applause)  She sat me down and gave me a very serious talk. My mothers from Gayaza High School gave me different aspects but she was the one who gave the most penetrating, piercing talk about the role of a leader; what you should be doing in Parliament. She said, when you are looking into the future, you must also look behind. Coming from Joyce Mpanga and knowing what had transpired in politics, I had a lot of respect for her friendship with my mother. It is a friendship that has cut through generations and their time from high school. They were constantly in touch with each other; constantly meeting with each other and doing things together. This is something we should look at because politically, they were on different sides but their friendship, belief in Uganda and hopes and aspirations are something which have cut through generations. We can all stand here and pay tribute to a great leader of Uganda. When we talk of emulating and the question of mentorship, I think the character of a mentor is very important; not everybody can mentor. As far as Joyce Mpanga is concerned, that has cut through because my mother can testify to this from high school. All through her life, she has been mentoring and trying to raise others to the level she was at. She has continuously tried to bring others up. This is a struggle which many of us have to undergo for the betterment of our country. I stand with the family on this day and send sincere condolences, on my behalf and behalf of my family. May the soul of Joyce Mpanga rest in eternal peace.4.21MR ABDU KATUNTU  (Independent, Bugweri County, Bugweri): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to pay tribute to the late Hon. Joyce Rovincer Mpanga. As I have said before, when paying tribute in this House, the conversation we are having today is not about somebody dead; it is between us. Are we talking to each other or are we acting? The late Joyce Mpanga is gone. What she did is about us; what do we emulate from her?I will talk about one thing; for those who have studied Buganda history, if you were born in the Masembe family, you were born in a privileged family. If you were married to Mpanga - not this Daudi but his father - you were married in a privileged family. If you were well-educated and married in a big family to one of the most celebrated lawyers this country has ever had, as the late Joyce Mpanga was, you could have chosen to live a privileged life. However, she decided to serve the people and help the underprivileged. That is the lesson we should be talking about; however privileged, educated or wealthy you are, use that to serve your people.  Times have changed. When you talk about Joyce Mpanga, you are talking about Miria Kalule Obote, Florence Nekyon, Rhoda Kalema, Namirembe Bitamazire, and Aidah Wanendeya. Those who come from Bugisu and Busoga know. These are the iconic names this country has had, especially in the Women Emancipation Movement. They were neither opportunistic nor seeking positions but how to empower the girl-child. I heard Hon. Cecilia Ogwal saying, “Today, I am being very emotional.” You are not being emotional, you are always like that. (Laughter)  That is the real her.11004TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGAThe calibre of women leaders and politicians at that time was not opportunistic. We have that challenge and weakness; we look at ourselves. As the Speaker says, you lie there and people struggle to get words to talk about you. Let us examine ourselves because tomorrow we will lie there. What will colleagues say about us?These women represent what a woman should. They did not seek favours because they were women; nobody should lie to you. They did not rise because they were women but because they broke the cultural, political, and economic barriers and are successful in their own right. That is what I always tell my daughter because she is not seeking to break those barriers, these people broke them for her. She has just left university and she can now compete, like any other person but these people did not have that opportunity. There were so many roadblocks along the way. How do we empower the girl-child upcountry, because the shackles and roadblocks are still there? When you go to your constituencies and look at the girls, how many of them are going on with their education? Let us look at the dropout rate of the girl-child, at primary or secondary school level.We have another category of Hon. Miria Matembe. These were assertive. I was privileged to work with her. We were the pioneer Members of the Pan African Parliament. The issue was women, even at that forum. She was not talking about women of Uganda but women of Africa. How many of us have that as our agenda? When you rise on affirmative action and die as a Member of Parliament on affirmative action, are you giving an opportunity for another woman to rise? (Applause)I thought affirmative action would empower one economically, and to get known to the constituency and therefore, compete for a constituency like any other person while affording another woman, who is unknown, the opportunity to come up. However, if we reach and arrive then we are not helping the girl-child. May the Almighty God rest the soul of Hon. Joyce Mpanga in peace. Thank you.THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Honourable colleagues, before I pick Hon. Asamo, Hon. Ruth Lematia, Hon. Huda, Hon. Margaret Rwebyambu, and the Mubende team, allow me to pick one of her closest friends who was with her in London. These are important stories that give us the real history. Hon. Joyce Ssebugwawo – 4.29THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR INFOR -MATION, COMMUNICATION TECH -NOLOGY AND NATIONAL GUIDANCE (INFORMATION) (Ms Joyce Ssebugwawo):  Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to pay tribute to my friend, elder sister, and men -tor; she was everything. I thank those who have spoken about her and what has been said is true. I appreciate all those who recognised her works and came here to pay tribute to her. To the family; David, Faith, Lydia, and others, my sympathies. It is with great pleasure that I stand here and pay tribute to an iconic lady, Owekitiibwa  Joyce Mpanga who has departed from us. We shall deeply miss her wisdom, knowledge, mentorship, and unmatched contribution to society.Traditionally, she has been a cultural leader. In the education sector and the country at large, she will be historically remembered for her invaluable contribution to us. She was one of the first women to be nominated to the LEGCO in the 1960s. She was the first African Deputy Headmistress of Gayaza High School, the first female graduate to get a Master’s degree and the first female lecturer in the Faculty of Education at Makerere University. She was also the first Minister of Women’s Affairs in the Government of Uganda in charge of primary school. She was among the women who started the Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE) in 1991. She was a founder member of UWESO, the First Lady’s initiative. She mentored many women into politics, being one of the first women in Parliament. She was an icon to the national women’s rights movement. [Mr Katuntu]11005THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023Joyce, as we used to call her, has also empowered many women to earn a livelihood through arts and crafts. She represented Mubende District in Parliament as the Woman Member of Parliament. Those were the contributions she made when she was in the Central Government. For the Buganda government, she was the first minister in charge of primary education in Buganda Kingdom. She was elected as a member of the Buganda Lukiiko  until she breathed her last. She was an advisor to the Kabaka  and the kingdom at large. She was close to the late Sir Edward Muteesa while in exile and since then, she has served the kingdom diligently, consequently being very instrumental in the restoration of the kingdom. She did a lot of work when the kingdom was being reinstalled in 1993. She played a very big role during that time. She was a member of the committee that prepared for the restoration of the kingdom. She was a representative of Namirembe Diocese at the provincial council and the late Owekitiibwa  Mpanga has served in several capacities selflessly and with dignity, while maintaining decorum at all times. When I speak about her, I cannot finish everything she has done because she has done a lot of work. She could do everything. To the family, I pay condolences to you because she loved her children very much. She had only two children. When we asked why she had only two children, she told us that she wanted to have very few so that she could look after them well, educate them well and give them everything that they wanted so that they could live comfortably. Therefore, she loved her children very much. It is a pity that she has left you. Joyce contributed a lot. She was a bush war lady and we were together right from 1983 when she joined the bush war. She had been in the struggle right from the 1970s and that is when she started the struggle in politics. Hon. Mpanga has been meeting many groups of people at her place; advising, counselling and mentoring them. She would never get tired of hosting visitors. Her home was always full of visitors because she wanted to entertain everybody. We used to have meetings at her place and she would not get tired. Every time one went there, she would welcome them and do everything in her power to make this country – she would entertain politics from time to time. She was very worried about the things that are ongoing in the country. She would take time to ask what we can do to save the situation. She was a political leader who would not get tired. She was old but her brain was super. She remembered everything and would do everything. She was a real mother to everybody. I do not know what we can do - I think it is up to us to emulate what Joyce has been doing. We need to check whether we are on the right track. We should ask, can what we are doing save this country? Do we love our country? This is what she had been trying to achieve from time to time. Joyce loved her kingdom and her king very much. She was an advisor to the king and she would do anything to make sure that our king is comfortable. We cannot forget you, Joyce, for all you have done. We shall always remember you for your good heart. She had a very big heart for everybody. She could not hate anybody. No matter what you did or said, Joyce would welcome you at her house. She was a wonderful mother and we shall always remember you for what you have done for this country. May your soul rest in peace. (Applause)THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you, Hon. Ssebugwawo. Hon. Asamo and then Hon. Lematia.11006TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGA4.39THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR GENDER, LABOUR AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT (DISABILITY AFFAIRS) (Ms Hellen Asamo):  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to stand to support the motion to pay tribute to the iron lady lying in front of us. I will start by paying my condolences to the family. I was privileged to be a board member of FAWE and I was also privileged to be the Chairperson of UWESO Soroti District. I also worked with Forum for Women in Democracy (FOWODE). I met Joyce more in the NGO world. No wonder she was the chairperson of the NGO Board at a certain point, clearing our roads. As a young lady, I had people who mentored me. This great lady here was willing to share her knowledge as far as building emancipation for a woman was concerned. Two years ago, we had another function and she has been active all her life. She has never been home resting because she is retired and tired. You would find her in meetings. Recently, we were at a function, I think for FOWODE or some such. I sat next to her and asked, “What does it mean to retire from Parliament?” She told me that after Parliament, one can have a very peaceful life. However, when you are out of Parliament, involve yourself in community activities. She said, “Be in church, be in community things, rotary things, and others. They can make you busy and you find that you will still serve the community like any other person.” No wonder she remained an active person in the Lukiiko  until she died. She has also been active in NGO matters. She also shared with me one thing – I do not know about the family very much, but I asked her how she survives. She said, “In my home, I have my two cows in the compound. They give me milk and as an old person, you need to take milk.” She added that she has a garden of vegetables, which are very easy to pick and fruits. “That is what you need when you are old.”I have never been to her home but I hope the family agrees with what she said. She said that you must have something in your backyard and that you do not need to have a big farm. She has fought for women’s emancipation and I remember in the meeting that we had two years ago, she asked, “What has happened to women? You are fighting each other and quarrelling instead of pulling each other up.” Leave alone the grandfather who said, “If she was a boy.” Even when she talked, she had a soft deep voice and because of her face, she said, many people mistook her to be a man but she would tell them, “No, I am a woman” and they would get shocked. She was a woman who had a lot of qualities. No wonder she brought up her children well. Hon. Joyce has been a teacher and her character has been very professional, smart, humble and focused. We have lost a lady and those who have got the advantage to be near her have learnt a lot. Mr Speaker, I stand here, on behalf of many civil society organisations that have been working with her, to pay our tribute. May God rest her soul in eternal peace. Thank you. 4.40MS RUTH LEMATIA (NRM, Maracha East County, Maracha): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me this opportunity. I stand to second the motion and at the same time express my great appreciation to the President for giving Hon. Joyce an official burial. Everything that has been said is what I observed about Hon. Joyce. I worked with her for a very long time. What has not been brought out is that she served as the Chairperson of the Public Service Commission. I met her as a young education officer in the Ministry of Education when I was appointed. We used to recruit health workers under the chairmanship of the Public Service Commission and that is why people thought that nurses entered the civil service at an early stage. 11007THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023When I worked with the late Hon. Joyce Mpanga together with late Bikangaga, I learnt a lot. I am what I am today because of this lady here and the late Bikangaga. When they realised that I was a young girl sent to work with them - There were times you would work for months and months because you were recruited. She was very gentle, patriotic, and did not discriminate against people. As a medical practitioner, I learnt that Joyce’s psychology was deeply-rooted. I discovered that she was a teacher and that she came from a very big, celebrated family; the Masembe family. I had earlier met some of them like Dr Kanyerezi Masembe and three younger sisters. There are two things I will remember this lady for. First, when we were recruited, the recruitment was skewed because we did not speak English as we are speaking today. The English was demanding in some areas. Secondly, sciences were not being taught all over Uganda. Because the two were educationists, they took it upon themselves to write to the Ministry of Education and as an education officer from the Ministry of Education, I was able to see this letter which said, “Please, make sure that all sciences are taught in all schools and not general science. Make sure that the English that you teach these children is straightforward.”You know very well that we speak English according to our local dialects - I am sure that you can get it from me. I am not saying that I am that way but some areas did not have the alphabet. That was a big worry for them and it was corrected. When I worked with her in the Public Service, she taught me to look at the country at large and that all areas needed medical workers. Surprisingly, you would find that there were no nurses in Mubende and Mbarara, but because of decentralisation, people can now work within their areas easily. That was corrected by them. She taught me how to juggle marriage, children, and my work and I appreciate her. When time for my promotion came, the two were very instrumental. They wrote to the Ministry of Education and Sports for me to be promoted. Hence, I was given accelerated promotion as Chief Health Training Officer in the Ministry of Education and Sports, a position I held and left. It was even stated that it was person-to-holder. This is what I learnt from them. Hon. Joyce, I am glad that I was given an opportunity to express my feelings upon your demise. You were a wonderful woman, a patriot, you loved Ugandans regardless of which direction they came from, and I learnt that from you. May God bless you. Fare thee well in front of your creator. I knew that she had only two children - By the way, she took me to her farm in Mukono and I served with her in Mengo. She was on the Board of Trustees while I was on the Board of Governors. May God bless and comfort you. Your mother was a woman who loved everybody. Please, to the two children, I am sure Hon. Joyce would be happy if you continued to bring out what she cultivated in you.4.50THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR DEFENCE AND VETERAN AFFAIRS (VETERAN AFFAIRS) (Ms Huda Oleru): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving the opportunity to pay tribute to the late Hon. Joyce. I was not in the 6th Parliament, but the first time I got to know her was when she went, together with other leaders, to Yumbe District to train women about women emancipation, governance and how join politics. At that time, I was a counsellor at subcounty level but we were all invited for that meeting. I listened to all that they said but did not have time to have a close interaction with her. When I joined the 8th Parliament, I got closer and nearer to Hon. Joyce. I remember under the Uganda Women Parliamentary Association 11008TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGA(UWOPA), we had very many meetings where Hon. Joyce      was invited to train us.  When I came to Parliament, I was not aware of the issues of women empowerment or gender mainstreaming. However, through that training, I got to understand that in this Parliament, I still have another specific role to play in protecting women.  Indeed, that is what I have been doing.Mr Speaker, this lady lying here - and others who are still around - I can see Maama  Cecilia and Maama  Matembe here.  I am close to Hon. Cecilia Ogwal and I was also close to Maama  Joyce      lying before us here because they would give me time to talk to them, whenever I wanted to consult on something.I enjoy the honourable member in the public gallery, but I cannot go near her because she is very tough. Sometimes, she can ask questions - When you are in a meeting with her, you will want to disappear. She says things as they are; you can see how she speaks to the media. I admire what she does but I do not move near her. (Laughter)I have been near Maama  Joyce and talked to her. Whenever she saw    me, she would call   and talk to      me. Maama  Cecilia is my mother and if I am lying, the microphone is here.      Recently, during this term, when there was a saga in this country, where many of the women leaders were involved - and specifically the leaders of this - I went to  Maama  Cecilia in the corridor and I said, “ Maama , are we not losing it? Is this what you people fought for? Can you call us, as leaders, and sit us down?” She told me, “My daughter I will do it, but not now. Otherwise the temperatures are up. Let us cool down.”I asked her if she could get an opportunity and talk to the Head of State of this country, His Excellency, President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, because I know they are friends. She said she would do that, but at a later time.I attended a meeting at Serena Hotel and the late Hon. Joyce and Hon. Victoria were there. They called me and said, “Huda, we are told that you are now   a minister. Are you part of the list?” I said, “God helped me and I am not there.” Then they asked me if we are still protecting what they fought for.  To the ladies here, I want to now – because Hon. Joyce is not here to ask that question - As women in this House, are we there to protect what these ladies fought for? Or as women in this Parliament now, we are now full of “arrivalism”  and we are forgetting what these people fought for.There is a pull down syndrome. I sometimes sympathise when I see us fighting ourselves, as ladies, and the men are watching on. The next day, we shall all be out of this place and it will be full of human beings who are men. (Laughter )I      would like to assure you that these ladies who have fought for us and created that space for us are not happy. I am talking about those who are still alive out there.     Today, Maama  has gone to give us an opportunity to reflect on what they have done. I knew her as somebody with integrity, honest and with strong morals. She has been a culturalist and woman activist, but not on issues of gender transgression, which we have now mixed up. When we see somebody pushing for human rights issues, they are indirectly bringing issues of homosexuality.      That was not her; that is how I knew her.She had self-awareness. She knew what was right and she fought for everybody, but today, she has gone. She was very courageous and respectful. She knew God. She knew that a person was created in the image of God and God was very happy; everyone was equal before God.      She did not classify people in terms of “who knows it better, and who does not know it.” In her eyes, all those were human beings. In this [Ms Oleru]11009THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023House when we begin to classify, grade and divide people on; who knows how to do it well, who   does not know it, who is a fisherman or fisherwoman - while in the Bible the fishermen and the fisherwomen are the people who have made Christianity to be what it is today. (Applause)  They helped Jesus to proclaim Christianity so they are very special. Unless      we look at them like those who are now fishing in Lake Victoria, we may degrade them now.When we look at those who in Galilea, you will respect them. (Applause)  We do not know the person who classified this as, fishermen and fisherwomen. We do not know who he was looking for; either these in Lake Victoria or those in Galilea– (Laughter)THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, I remember that day because he referred to the Bible.MS OLERU:  I think he referred to that. Members, let us respect each other. Some of us are on the list of fishermen and fisherwomen. When we hear our brothers bursting at us like that, we feel pity, but we are human beings. When you see that I have done something wrong, call me, sit me down and tell me how it is supposed to be. Can we develop that relationship other than being very abusive, when we are paying a final tribute to a very important person that we are going to lay to rest? (Applause)THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you.    MS OLERU:  Maama , may you rest in eternal peace.THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you. Hon. Huda Oleru, I could feel your concern, but sometimes this is aimed at taking you off-track but you are a very strong lady. We have not heard any issue with your ministry –(Hon. Ecweru rose_)–  No, Hon. Musa Ecweru – Hon. Oleru, you are doing extremely      well.I also want to tell you that Hon. Miria Matembe is surprisingly among the kindest people. I do not know why you are scared of her. One day, I will personally be the go-between. I will arrange and you have an engagement because she is one of the people I consult on my side. She has been kind and fair whenever   I consult her on several issues.5.00MS MARGARET  RWEBYAMBU (NRM, Woman Representative, Mbarara): Thank you, Mr Speaker. (Members rose_)THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Honourable colleagues, we are still here. I do not know what you are rushing for.      MS RWEBYAMBU: Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to pay tribute to the late Hon. Joyce Mpanga, one of the first women to join legislative politics. Like my honourable minister Huda, I was not in the Sixth Parliament but allow me to say that history gives us a chance to relate and speak about people that we have not grown or worked with, but simply because what they do in their journey of life speaks volumes even when they are long gone. People can still learn one or two things from them. As a young girl growing up in rural areas of Mbarara district, Hon. Joyce Mpanga is one of the people that I grew up looking up to, admiring whether one time, I would also be like her because of her selfless struggle for women’s emancipation and being a champion of equity and equality. Reflecting on her book, “ It’ s a Pity She’ s Not a  Boy”,  and how her maternal grandfather used to love her and relate with her - but along the way being disappointed because she was not a boy tells it all. I believe it is where she derived the courage to work very hard to show that whether you are a boy or a girl, you can still make it in life. I would like to say, “thank you” Hon. Joyce Mpanga, for breaking the barriers for us, as women, today. (Applause)  We can sail through now, we can go to politics and compete with whoever you want to be. 11010TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGAIn 2016, I contested with men and one of the reasons I did that is because I was looking up to such women. I was looking up to the Hon. Miria Matembe and Hon. Mary Mugyenyi, who were women representing constituencies, not districts, on affirmative action. I would like to wish her a safe journey to meet the Angels. As for the family, take heart; God will sit in the place where Maama  has been sitting. Rest in peace, Maama  Joyce. THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you. Before Hon. Museveni, Hon. Margaret Rwebyambu came with Hon. Esenu to my office to book space to submit on this motion. I want to give them an opportunity; people who walk to the office around midday should first be given an opportunity. 5.04MR ANTHONY ESENU (NRM, Kapelebyong County, Kapelebyong ): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to pay tribute. I stand to support the motion and pay tribute from a different angle. First, I associate myself with all the positive remarks made about Maama  Joyce Mpanga. For those who may not know, I hail from Kapelebyong in Teso and I am paying tribute not from the side of work or politics, but from the side of a son, a friend and her private life.I call her Maama . I got to meet Hon. Joyce Mpanga through her children. The son-in-law, Dr Ssebuyira, was my schoolmate at university and we became very good friends. Through his marriage to Dr Lydia, I got to know the family standing right there. We became very close family friends and that is when I began to interface with the lady who is lying there in state. Mr Speaker, when I met Joyce Mpanga, apart from being told who she was or what she had done in society, you could not see any airs of pomp coming out of her. She was a lady who was down to earth. She associated with us like she was our peer. The way she talked, she had an interesting way of blending her motherly nature and being like a father. My being here today is because of this lady. When I was struggling with the issue of whether to go into politics or not, having been in the NGO world, I looked around for people to mentor me and advise me and through the Ssebuyiras, I asked to meet with her. When she heard about this, she immediately called me and said, “Tony, come” and I went. Over three- I think about four different days and sessions, we sat for three to four hours. She walked me through some very interesting guidance that eventually helped me not just accept to proceed and join politics, but also determine the way to conduct my politics. Allow me to say a few things she mentioned to me. One of them said, “Tony, when you become a Member of Parliament, you are not a Member of Parliament for Kapelebyong, you will be an MP for Uganda.” I felt that was very significant and profound and she said, “You have to see this as your country and cease to focus on where you come from but think of this country as your constituency.” That was very profound for me. Secondly, she said, “Tony, live within your means.” The question of living above your financial status and entering into debt during campaigns… and beyond, she said, “If you do that, it will cripple your being a Member of Parliament.” Thirdly, she said, “Tony, you need to be a person of integrity; you should mean what you say and say what you mean and above all, keep in tune with your conscience when you are either in public or in private life.” I think she said, “You have to protect your name. Whatever happens in political life, know that it is just for a season because, beyond politics, you are going to remain who you are.” She said, “Guard and protect your name” Meaning your legacy and how you stand before the public. In that discussion - and I want to say this with all humility, I saw a woman who [Ms Rwebyambu]11011THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023was a true and beautiful Muganda. I say that with deep respect. I met and sat with a lady who gave me a special sense of admiration for Buganda and the Baganda. In that character of hers, nowhere did I feel that she thought in either a belittling manner or a negative manner about my being outside of Buganda. She respected me, respected where I came from and addressed me like one of her sons. I call her Maama.The second thing was in the course of her life, as we met so many times, I realised that Joyce never missed any event of her children. They are here to attest to that. Whether it was a party of the grandchildren, her kids or whatever event it was, she made sure she was there. She had this exuberance of peaceful joy and laughter. When you engaged with her, you would feel not like you are with a mother, in the sense that some mothers are so distant because of who they are in age but you would feel you are dealing with a friend. Mr Speaker, I later on learned the role she played in our country.As a House, we are losing the fathers and mothers of this country. Like Maama  Cecilia Ogwal said when she was giving her tribute, I felt tears falling from my eyes. The question was, “Did you call or consult her?” I am asking myself this question that I have always asked myself. Can we, as a Parliament, create a platform where we allow our past leaders, who are outside the confines of this Parliament, to continue contributing to the affairs of this country by advising us, as a young group of leaders, on how to lead the country and come up with policy issues?  My prayer is that as we pay tribute and think about a way forward, let us consider how to create a framework for our fathers and mothers of this country across the political divide to speak to us and guide this country. I beg to submit. Maama , rest in eternal peace. (Applause)THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. 5.12MR WILLIAM MUSEVENI (Independent, Buwekula South County, Mubende): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I come from Mubende, where the late served as a woman MP. By then, Mubende was still one bloc before Mityana and Kassanda districts were created. I think Kiboga had already been curved out and it was Mityana, Kassanda and now, Mubende.I join the rest of the mourners, both nationally and worldwide, to mourn the demise of our great leader and mentor who did great work in our district. She is remembered for mentoring many into active politics, especially women, both at local and national levels. She was a consultant for everyone.If you are to research and read any article about Mubende, you will find her name on every page, if not, on every paragraph. We appreciate her. When we heard of the sad news, people in the entire area went into mourning, especially those who worked with her and some of us who have just joined politics. At the time she came here as a woman MP, some of us were young; I was in Senior One. We have read about her and associated with people who served with or were mentored by her. Her work was great.Mr Speaker, not only Mubende people but the entire nation should appreciate the family that brought her up and nurtured her to prepare her to serve this nation before even Independence. As Maama  Cecilia Ogwal was speaking, we learned a lot from her and we need to appreciate her. Such great families should be appreciated.We thank her for serving the nation and not forgetting the family. She has left behind a great family, which we should appreciate and learn from. As leaders, we give our time to other things and sometimes forget our families. As you serve the nation, we should plan for our families. Her history is rich and a great lesson to leaders. 11012TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGAWith those words, I wish her a great rest in eternal peace. May the Almighty God receive her.5.16DR KEEFA KIWANUKA (NRM, Kiboga East County, Kiboga): Thank you, Mr Speaker – (Members rose_)THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Please, I am doing a round of MPs from the area that she represented.DR KEEFA KIWANUKA: I also rise to support the motion to pay tribute to Owekitiibwa  Joyce Rovincer Mpanga. I am from Greater Mubende and actually, Kiboga was part of Mubende at the time when she was MP. Therefore, we have lost our former Member of Parliament.The people of Kiboga are greatly saddened by the death of Owekitiibwa  Joyce Rovincer Mpanga. On their behalf, we would like to pay our most heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family, the people of Lungujja, His Excellency the President of Uganda for the time that she served in his Government, His Royal Highness, the Kabaka of Buganda, Ronald Muwenda Mutebi, the Lukiiko  and many people that she served with there, and the many friends around that are all grieving at this moment in time. It is very sad to lose her at this particular moment in time. However, amidst these tears and as we console the family, we thank God who lent her to us. The life expectancy at the moment is 63 years; she has lived for 90 years. We thank the Almighty God for the years that He gave her.We also thank God for the great work that she has done; a lot of it has been talked about. We thank God for the family that He has given her; the distinguished lawyers, poets, and all distinguished men and women who are serving diligently in this country.We thank God for what she has achieved; her selfless struggle as a role model for women’s emancipation and the key support roles she has played in Buganda Kingdom. Above all, I heard Prof. Mushemeza saying that we are about to lose the battle on corruption. We thank God that He gave us somebody who was incorruptible and we will greatly miss her and her contribution. We will miss the way she has been mentoring the many people that have talked about their close association with her. She leaves after a distinguished service, without any stain; we thank God for that.May her soul rest in eternal peace. (Applause)5.20MR KIVUMBI MUWANGA (NUP, Butambala County, Butambala): Mr Speaker, thank you for this opportunity. I rise to pay tribute to Owekitiibwa  Hon. Joyce Mpanga. My honourable colleagues have spoken very much about other things but there is one aspect that I rise to speak about, as I pay tribute.The task that transcends generations and the passage of time for all of us is a struggle to forge our nationhood, and build a nation called Uganda and Africa as a proud continent who we are was forced upon us by colonial masters; who by their sheer force of coercion brought us together. Therefore, the generation of Hon. Joyce Mpanga and us share a common struggle; how to forge national unity, at the same time stay who we are. Hon. Esenu has said that he talked to a proud Muganda woman. Our biggest challenge of the day is, how do I stay Hon. Muwanga Kivumbi, a Muganda, Hon. Anthony Esenu from Kapelebyong - I do not know the tribe, Hon. Cecilia Ogwal from Lango; at the same time, be a true Ugandan in all aspects and Pan-Africanist. What we have normally seen over the years are men and women who live in self-denial. They deny that they are not tribalists; claim that they are patriotic and nationalistic but for their every intent and purpose, they find a reason to hibernate back into tribalism.[Mr Museveni]11013THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023Therefore, the lady we celebrate here is a true Muganda who lived true to the cultural values and institution of Baganda but a true Ugandan and Pan-Africanist. That is a struggle we have; to be who we are, work together and build a genuine national state called Uganda or Pan-Africanism. We cannot do it by self-denial neither by men and women who in the evening conspire against others, against the community, call other people all kinds of names, but at the same time they suit themselves up and say we are nationalists. Therefore, the likes of Hon. Joyce Mpanga are a true challenge and role model in this aspect. You truly knew who you were dealing with; a lady who loves her Kabaka  but at the same time, you have spoken about her struggle in gender, education and on the African continent. That is why I have seen wreaths coming in groups of Baganda, Bateso - Can we go back and re-examine who we are and build  structures administratively, politically and socially that can endure the passage of time? Maybe that is the only way we can truly pay tribute to ladies like Hon. Joyce Mpanga. I rest my case. May God bless her. May her soul rest in eternal peace. THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, Hon. Kivumbi. And he happens to be the chairperson, Buganda Parliamentary Caucus.  5.24MS JOYCE BAGALA (NUP, Woman Representative, Mityana): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I stand to mourn a great daughter of greater Mubende because I come from where she comes from, only that the districts were later cut into many others and she served that community diligently. When I was growing up as a young girl in Mityana, we only heard about leaders like herself, Hon. Joyce Mpanga, and Ms Zelida Rwabushagara and I aspired to be the kind of woman that she was. I was privileged that later in life when I became a journalist, I came into contact with her. I got a rare opportunity in a sit-down conversation in 2017 and she told me many things. I had gone to do an interview about education but we ended up talking a lot about her personal life. That is when she told me about when she lost her husband and the kind of courage that she picked to look after her children.  Of course, I knew her son, Owekitiibwa  Daudi Mpanga, as my friend and she told me that one of the reasons she was able to look after her children and give them a good education was that she did not give birth to many children; she had a few and she was able to look after them. However, most importantly, she had the courage to work and get money to look after them without self-pity. On the contrary, so many of our women take a lot of self-pity. That was not Hon. Joyce Mpanga and it is a lesson that we should pick as women. Many have talked about - we all the time say, “because I am a woman, I need to be favoured, I need this -” in those kinds of terms. We need to pick lessons from women like Hon. Joyce Mpanga. She was an icon of women emancipation and she championed the women’s cause with conviction. Her interest was for all women or girl children to access education the same way the male counterparts would access education and for that we need to emulate her and work towards that. Unfortunately, Hon. Joyce Mpanga takes leave at a time when the women’s movement has been hijacked by self-seekers and vulgarised, but also sacrificed for political expediency. This is where most of us who hold the women-cause dear should rise up, emulate Hon. Joyce Mpanga and the rest in her calibre to do what they did. Probably, we may not do it to their extent but to try and live like those kinds of women. Thank you. 11014TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGATHE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you.  5.27MS CHRISTINE KAAYA (NUP, Woman Representative, Kiboga): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I stand to support the motion and to thank God for the life of our fallen lady, mentor and woman leader, Hon. Joyce Mpanga. I have always requested God to grant me death at 90 years and I pray that it so happens.  THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I hope you do not seek an amendment when you are about to reach 90.  ( Laughter ) MS KAAYA: No. Mr Speaker, we felt very bad when we heard the news of the loss of our lady. I grew up in Mubende and I am a teacher’s daughter, commonly known as muwala w’abasomesa  and we have been living to emulate the example of these ladies; the ones that have been listed, including Ms Zelida Rwabushagara and now, we are only remaining with Hon. Rhoda Kalema. I thank you for the visit you paid to her; she has always wanted Members of Parliament to seek her advice on some of the ongoing debates and processes. She was proposing that since there is a COVID-19 and a number of contagious diseases, it may not be okay for all of us to visit. It may not be healthy but she wrote a book called “ My Life is, but a Weaving”  and like the late wrote, we need to hear and get inspired from their literature and emulate them. When we were still in primary, I was at St Joseph’s Primary School in Mubende Town Council – I remember the late being a good mobiliser, mobilising women and that is what Hon. Rhoda Kalema is advising us; mobilise these women, the message will come when they are there. Our challenge as women is mobilisation. Now, when it comes to political divide it is another issue. They may not look at what you are going to say but provided it is Hon. Kaaya inviting them, then they should be discouraged from converging and the freedom of association begins the deprivation of women’s development. Therefore, whenever they would announce that Hon. Joyce Mpanga is also coming, even the school-going children would want to convene. All the women would come to convene in what used to be called the Mayor’s Garden in Mubende Town Council. I used to copy her in that area. She did her work because at 90 years, a lot of her work was to care for her health. What is left for us who are going to fight for women’s rights?  In the districts of greater Mubende, there is still a lot of fear of owning property; being gender sensitive includes owning property. Most of the women in the      Greater Mubende area would like to buy property      and      those who manage to buy property do it secretly. It is very disturbing that the most treasured property, land, is at stake. Most of our women who have managed to buy and own such an asset are being evicted. Therefore, tenure security for women is a serious issue. The other issue that we need to work on is confidence building in the area. Many of our women still fear to engage in politics and also to express themselves. As a woman, she did her work. We have to build from where she stopped and sustain these efforts. I think we should not fear.  When we are speaking the truth about women, we need to learn from her not to fear and say the truth about women. That is when we shall be able to mobilise all of us. This business of bringing up this topic and saying, “I am not a woman” - Then when it comes to you,     you want women to stand with you; it will not work. We have to stand with the women and their issues from the start. Dear ladies, women Members of Parliament, we have a strong platform here at Parliament. We should not even feel as if we are orphans or left somewhere else. There are a number of platforms - UWOPA is a serious platform, so let us use it; these are people who would see you meandering and    invite you.11015THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023Yes, other people may fear to approach Maama  Cecilia. Maama  Cecilia, feel free to also talk about the wrongs of some women. Do not wait for us to come to you because by the time we come, it may be very difficult to reverse. Please, feel free to talk to us and correct some of the actions that we are undertaking - These women would invite us -      Mr Speaker, we can invite some of these ladies to our WhatsApp  groups to speak to us, but we are over-exalting some functions on these groups. Can we host some of these ladies to talk to us on our WhatsApp groups as visitors? This is because they readily have smartphones and they want to speak to us. They need to be rewarded in some way. For my Maama  Rhoda - the one we call Jajja  Rhoda in Kiboga - because Hon. Dr Ruth is      Maama       and I am Baaba  - Maama  will be happy to see Members appreciating her by buying her book, which costs Shs 50,000.      She will be contented that at least the 11th Parliament recognises her contribution to Uganda. I thank you, Mr Speaker.THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you. Hon. Musa Ecweru and then Hon. Babalanda. The      motion will be moved after those two.5.34THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR WORKS AND TRANSPORT (WORKS) (Mr Musa Ecweru): Mr Speaker, I rise to support the motion to pay tribute to Maama  Joyce Mpanga. I did not get an opportunity to work very closely with the late. I was in the village, before I came to Parliament, as a field administrator and a Resident District Commissioner for many years. I came here in 2006 and I got the record of some of these exemplary leaders. I had the privilege of visiting a beautiful city in Italy and when you pass that city, there is a big cemetery hosting some of the remains of many heroes of that country. At the gate of that cemetery, there is bold writing, which says, and I quote, “We were once like you and you shall be like us.” The dead are reminding us that they were once like us and we shall be like them. The late Rhoda - God forbid – the late Joyce once sat here in this wonderful place, deliberated, made laws and all these wonderful things we have heard, but today, she is quiet there. One day, we shall be there. I think what is critical is what she has left behind. I did not know much - like I have said, I looked at the records - but I have listened to the profiles of the children of this wonderful lady. Many of us, my friends, are very powerful here but our children are in Centenary Park smoking opium. Our children will never be like this. It is important, friends, the way - me, Musa Ecweru, my prayer is that if the day I lie - and that day will come - like this wonderful lady - if my children can sit there and carry the kind of profiles these ones are carrying, then I will be happy with where I am going. (Applause)I know you may take what I am saying lightly, my friends. Let us blend our public roles with the roles of raising our children. If you asked me to judge a successful parent, I would tell you to parade your children before me. If I look at your children, then I will tell you who you are. I can tell who madam, the late now, was by these children. (Applause)  I thank you - First, growth presupposes that my father William Ecweru remained at that level. He was a Nyampala.  Musa Ecweru is now a Nyampala  of Uganda and my children should be the Nyampalas  of the world. Joyce was here –THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Honourable minister, what is Nyampala ? (Laughter)      MR      ECWERU:  My father, William Ecweru, was in charge of two subcounties; slashing roads. He was in charge of those fellows who were making the roads. Two subcounties - Nyampala.  Now road - 11016TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGATHE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Hon. Ecweru, I want a simple clarification for the Hansard . “Nyampala”  means someone in charge.MR ECWERU:  Yes, that was him. Now, Musa Ecweru is the one in charge of Uganda – (Interjections)-  roads - Now, my children must be in charge of the continental roads. That is a successful Musa Ecweru. That is a successful you; a successful group; a successful mother - To produce a lawyer so outstanding, like the one you have described, from a humble teacher - that is a successful woman. What even touched me is that she became a widow at a tender age, like the Member has correctly said. Most of them would have loved to be objects of pity; “oh sorry, maama”  all the time  but she stood on her feet and made sure she determined her destination and now, she has raised wonderful Ugandans. You have gone- I also thank President Museveni for creating a platform for women to become what they are. (Applause)Many brilliant people in Uganda, especially women have been suppressed by previous leaders. However, President Yoweri Museveni, take it or leave it, has created this environment for these ladies to succeed and I thank him. (Applause)  May the soul of the late Hon. Mpanga, rest in peace. THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you, Hon. Milly Babalanda.5.41THE MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (PRESIDENCY) (Ms Milly Babalanda):  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I commend the late Hon. Joyce Mpanga, for her exemplary diligence, calmness and scandal-free service while she served as the Minister of State for Education and Sports, and in other capacities like Hon. Joyce Ssebugwawo mentioned. Mr Speaker, I come from the Busoga region and I have been briefed by my colleagues from Busoga that Hon. Joyce Mpanga constructed Walukuba- Masese low-cost estate for the underprivileged. Ugandans will dearly miss Hon. Joyce Mpanga. Mr Speaker, let me take this opportunity to thank His Excellency, the President of the Republic of Uganda, who is also the National Chairperson of the mighty NRM party for granting Hon. Joyce Mpanga an official burial in memory of her commitment to the Government. As chairperson of the organising committee, we must make sure that everything goes well, as planned by the family and by my committee. May the soul of Hon. Joyce Mpanga rest in eternal peace. THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Honourable colleagues, when we had just welcomed the body to lie in state, as I was greeting the family, the daughter, Dr Lydia Sebuyira, mentioned something, which made me reflect on my legacy. She said, “This was a great woman.” That reflects well with what Hon. Ecweru talked about. If she had been a great woman just serving the country without looking at the family, the daughter - we in the public would say it, but not the children. It is very critical and we all keep learning to be the best we can be. I do not think any one of us would want to be a bad parent.Our styles might be different, but it is something we have to look at to know that if we have reached where we have reached, then our children need to reach even greater heights. That can only be done through commitment, focus, and knowing that you must strike the right balance between work, politics and the family, especially in the life you live. If your life is tainted with corruption, your child will be ridiculed at school.The other children will be saying, “Your dad, your mother, we saw this on TV…”, especially in this era of social media. If you are good, the children will say, “We want you to take us to your dad”. That is a very big challenge for us. 11017THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 21 NOVEMBER 2023However, I am sure we shall achieve it, we are doing well and we are trying. It is very difficult to satisfy society, but we are trying. However, what is very critical, especially with the young generation, is mentoring. This business of thinking that you know it, you have arrived, you know everything -last time, I called a few senior legislators Hon. Kivumbi, Hon. Alex Byarugaba- I did not know that people look at consulting as a sign of weakness. It shocks me. When you say that I am calling colleagues to see how we put our heads together and see how best we can drive the institution, to some people it is a sign of weakness.  Honourable colleagues, we put our heads down and learn. By the way, even Hon. Cecilia Ogwal learns from one who has just come. I can learn from you about farming, new trends and how to handle new situations; all this happens. I wish the way we unite whenever we are paying tribute is the same way we unite on all matters; we acknowledge our weaknesses and our strengths; no one is superior to the other. We should all know that whoever has come here is looking at the common good of the country; that is what should be driving us, not what we just say, but even beyond what we say. How do we conduct ourselves? Hon. Cecilia Ogwal had a motion-5.47MS CECILIA OGWAL (FDC, Woman Representative, Dokolo):  Mr Speaker, given the tremendous contributions of Hon. Joyce Mpanga in the field of education, politics and more especially in the girl-child education and women in development, I beg to move that Parliament recommends under item 3 that the Government considers naming one of the existing Faculties of Education, or Women and Gender Studies, in any of the public universities in memory of Hon. Joyce Mpanga. I beg to move, Mr Speaker. THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I have just checked through; this has no financial implications, so it would not violate - Is the motion seconded? (Members rose_)Seconded by Hon. Namuyangu, Hon. Rwamirama, Hon. Namuganza, Hon. Elwelu, Hon. Andrew Oulanyah, Hon. Babalanda, the Leader of the Opposition(LOP), Hon. Jonathan, Hon. Kivumbi, Hon. Bagala, Hon. Solomon, Hon. Katabazi, Hon. Mushemeza; seconded by the whole House. Honourable colleagues, I know that on such a day, it is usually very painful whenever I am concluding such a session. It is always difficult to find that you have denied a colleague a chance to speak, and you do not know what they wanted to contribute. However, we have the family here. They have been here the whole day. They have Service at home. They are human beings; they are tired and tomorrow is another long day. I think the views gathered are representative of the general views in the House. I will consider the amendment for the question with the rest of the motion. I now put the question, that the motion to pay tribute to the late Hon. Joyce Rovincer Mpanga, former Member of Parliament, Minister and Distinguished Educationist, be adopted with the amendment as proposed by Hon. Cecilia Ogwal.(Question put and agreed to.)Motion adopted.THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I now instruct the Clerk to transmit a copy of the resolution together with a copy of the Hansard  to the family of the late Hon. Joyce Mpanga as we wish her rest in eternal peace. Next item.     (The East African Community Anthem)(The National Anthem)11018TRIBUTE TO THE LATE HON. JOYCE ROVINCER MPANGA(Exit of the late Hon. Joyce Rovincer Mpanga)THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you, honourable colleagues, for waiting this long and standing with the family. House adjourned to tomorrow at 2 o’clock.(The House rose at 5.55 p.m. and adjourned until Wednesday, 22 November 2023 at 2.00 p.m.)
