Parliament met at 2.58 p.m. in Parliament House, Kampala.

PRAYERS

(The Speaker, Mr Edward Ssekandi, in the Chair.)

The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, it is my pleasure to welcome you to this sitting, after the brief recess of three weeks. This recess was given to you to enable you sort out domestic affairs in your respective parties so that you make the parties stronger than they were before –(Laughter)- so that the multiparty system, which we adopted and under which the present Parliament is being run, moves on smoothly. I hope you have been able to achieve positive results.

This recess was given when we had very important business to handle, including the processing of the country’s budget. I know there are other activities that you will be involved in during the year, but it should be known that the tenure of this Parliament will end in May next year. Therefore, in spite of the fact that there will be other activities - elections and so on - you are expected to carry on your work as Members of Parliament of the Eighth Parliament. So, you will be expected to adjust your schedules so that at the same time, parliamentary work does not suffer.

When the recess was given, there were certain provisions of the Budget Act that had to be complied with, namely, Section 8, which provides that, “There shall be presented to Parliament, by the Budget Committee, the recommendations submitted to the Speaker under Section 7(3).” I think this was done.

Section 9 says, “There shall be presented to Parliament, by the sessional committees, the reports on the budget estimates that fall within their respective jurisdictions by the 31st day of August in each financial year.” This is bwiino.

Unfortunately, this was not done, but under Section 22, it provides that, “The Speaker may extend any period provided under this Act for a reasonable period”.

So, having done that and faced the problem that by 31st the committees had not presented the reports, I exercised the powers given to me by Section 22 to extend the period to today 13th September. Therefore, I expect you to do what you are supposed to do under Section 9 by today. You are welcome. (Laughter)

3.05
MR KASSIANO WADRI (FDC, Terego County, Arua): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my brothers and sisters who have returned from a three weeks’ battle in the political field.

In Luganda they say, “abalala baseka, abalala bakaaba”, meaning that others are rejoicing or laughing while others cry. That is very normal in this political dispensation that we are in. I can say that we are also entering into our trenches beginning this week.

If you imagined that there are no primaries in FDC, I am now telling you in my capacity as the deputy secretary general in charge of administration that we are also going to having our primaries conducted this week and the exercise kicks off in Northern Uganda. For us, we will go region by region.

Having said that, with the guidance you have given us about the budgeting process, I think it is of very great concern, not only to us as a Parliament that should have done its part of responsibility, but more so the fact that we have not done our bit. This has also inhibited very severely on the operations of Government ministries and departments.

Therefore, it is my prayer that this process should not be extended any further. Even for us here in Parliament, you cannot hear about thunder or clouds forming because of the same situation. I think I am very clear on that. You know you have just come back from the battle field and those of us who are preparing to go want to go there when it is raining and drizzling, which is not going to happen if this budget is not passed.

My appeal to honourable colleagues is let us, amidst our tight schedules, spare time and go through this process so that we get rid of it once and for all, then we can go into the political gymnastics and other matters, which may not be of great concern and importance like this budget.

I appeal to you, Mr Speaker, that we try as much as possible to postpone, as it were, matters or business that do not matter and are not of the same gravity in as far as the impact of not approving the budget is concerned. I thank you, Mr Speaker.

3.08
MR ODONGA OTTO (FDC, Aruu County, Pader): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise to seek your guidance. I sit on the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs and this issue pertains to the Electoral Commission. As you may be aware, in the last three weeks, we were not able to transact business in Parliament because our colleagues were going for their primaries. But I am a little concerned that the Electoral Commission has planned nominations for parliamentary elections in November, which means that in November, December, January and February we shall be politicking and campaigning.

I was concerned as to why the Electoral Commission would want Members of Parliament to campaign for a quarter of a year and yet in the last campaigns we just had one month. Now that our colleagues have even finished their primaries, they will not need more time, to the tune of four months. So, if it is in the interest of this country, Mr Speaker, I would like your guidance if a body could be constituted to dialogue with the Electoral Commission because they presented very reasonable arguments before our committee, which included the printing of ballot papers; so that they prevail over the Electoral Commission for us to have a shorter period for campaigning. Our mandate extends up to May next year, so there is no way we are going to abandon this House for four months to campaign.
I seek your guidance on this issue of the Electoral Commission and see who can prevail on them to change their programme.

Those who want to contest against me have been moving for six months. For four months people will not be digging as we engage them in politicking.

3.11
MR NATHAN NANDALA-MAFABI (FDC, Budadiri County West, Sironko): I also want to congratulate our colleagues who won their primaries in the NRM. Mr Speaker, what you have stated is right under the law. By 31st August we should have passed the budget but the law also allows you to extend.

I do not think Government has stopped operating because we have not passed the budget. We always pass a third of the Vote-on-Account and I do not agree to this issue of saying that we cannot get salaries because we have not passed the entire budget. A third of a year is four months which will end on 31st October. This is why we have a collection order which we have given to URA to collect taxes up to 31st October using the collection order. 

I am not saying that we should not do our duty; it is very important for us to conclude the budget and we are certain that in one month, we should be able to have passed this budget.

THE SPEAKER: I have determined the period under Section 22 and I said it is today.

3.13
MR HUSSEIN KYANJO (JEEMA, Makindye Division West, Kampala):  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to join my colleagues in welcoming back the NRM members who have been through their primaries. I must say that some of the events that characterised this election were displeasing to a number of us and we think some Members will start listening when we talk about the national Electoral Commission. It is true that most of the Members lost under very mysterious circumstances and this is a very big dent on Uganda and not just NRM as a party.

I would like to inform this House that we had an agreement between the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs and the Minister of Internal Affairs. We reached an agreement that the circumstances under which Government of Uganda was going to acquire the biometric scheme of identity cards were not explained to this House and thus the minister has to come and explain to this House before we pass the budget of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

This Minister has not come here to explain, so, I am seeking your indulgence to advise the Minister of Internal Affairs to respect this, for him to avoid future embarrassment.

3.15
MR LIVINGSTONE OKELLO-OKELLO (UPC, Chwa County, Kitgum): I would like to congratulate the winners and sympathise with the losers on the other side. I was hesitant to say this because I was confused by media reports as some people were losing and winning again or winning and then losing; but all the same, congratulations to those who succeeded.
 
My next point is on the handling of the budget. I do not know whether it cannot be speeded up. Last year, I was part of a parliamentary committee which visited Lusaka and we sat in their Parliament during the passing of their budget. They do not read the figures. The Speaker only mentions the votes and they continue. This helps them to clear many ministries in one day.

This is because they believe that Members will have studied the figures, but if someone has a query then they can state it. If we are to handle it the normal way, then I do not see how we can pass this budget before the end of next month.

THE SPEAKER: The only response I have to give is to hon. Otto who wanted guidance. His concern was about the lengthy period of campaigns after the nominations on 24th and 25th November when elections are February or beginning of March.
What I can say is that the Electoral Commission is supposed to act independently without any influence, but they have heard your reservations and they will consider them. I will not be seen to be influencing them.

BILLS 
FIRST READING

THE UGANDA NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS (AMENDEMENT) BILL, 2010

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TRADE (Mr Gagawala Wambuzi): Mr Speaker, I move that the Bill entitled, “The Uganda National Bureau of Standards (Amendment) Bill, 2010” be read for the first time. In accordance with the Budget Act, I would like to lay on Table a Certificate of Financial Implications.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: I would like to raise a point of procedure. The minister read the Bill to be read for the first time. He was never supported and he is continuing. 

THE SPEAKER: He was supported. The motion was seconded.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: I never saw hon. Omach.(Laughter)

MR GAGAWALA: Thank you for saving me. I would like to lay the Certificate of Financial Implications on Table.

MR OKUMU: I thank you, Mr Speaker. I congratulate you on having been elected unopposed. Is it in order for hon. Isaac Musumba, the Minister of State for Regional Cooperation to sit behind when the frontbench is empty? Is he in order when he is still a minister? (Laughter)

THE SPEAKER: Well, I do not know, but it could appear that he is consulting with a neighbour. (Laughter)

MR GAGAWALA: In accordance with the Budget Act, I beg to lay on Table a Certificate of Financial Implications issued by the Minister of Finance, who actually seconded this motion, and I lay this on Table, together with the Bill. 

THE SPEAKER: The Bill stands committed to the appropriate committee.

PRESENTATION OF PAPERS

REQUEST TO BORROW SDR 6.6. MILLION (US$ 10.05) FROM THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION (IDA) OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP FOR FINANCING THE EAST AFRICAN PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORIES NETWORK PROJECT

3.22 
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Fred Omach): Mr Speaker, I beg to present a request to this Parliament to borrow Special Drawing Rights 6.6 million equivalent to US$ 10.05 million from the International Development Association of the World Bank Group for financing the East African Public Health Laboratories Network Project. I beg to lay.

THE SPEAKER: Let the appropriate committee study the documents and then subsequently make a report to Parliament. I understand that the Minister of Finance has another paper. 

3.23
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Fred Omach): I beg to lay on Table Corrigenda No.3 to the draft estimates for the Financial Year 2010/11. This corrigendum was submitted to this Parliament on 6 September 2010 and sufficient copies have been provided to Members of Parliament. This has arisen because as you are aware, the UPDF is in Mogadishu, Somalia to undertake African Union peace keeping mission and the Ministry of Defence is expecting to receive US$ 48,946,568 equivalent to Shs 112.5 billion from the African Union to facilitate UPDF activities in Somalia for the Financial Year 2010/11. I beg to lay.

THE SPEAKER: Let the appropriate committee study the document and do the needful.

MOTION THAT PARLIAMENT DO RESOLVE ITSELF INTO A COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY FOR CONSIDERATION AND APPROVAL OF:

I) THE REVISED REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2009/2010

II) THE BUDGETARY PROPOSALS FOR THE ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2010/2011

THE SPEAKER: I think that in line with Section 9 of the Budget Act, let me take this opportunity to call upon the chairpersons or members of various committees to table their reports for the House and I start with the Committee on Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries.

3.26
THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND FISHERIES (Mr Stephen Kasaija):  I thank you, Mr Speaker. I think the report has been circulated. This is the report from the Committee on Agriculture and we have made an executive summary. I think the Members will have copies. 

The total amount is Shs 350,561,828,000. I beg to move.

THE SPEAKER: I put the question that we adopt the report.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE SPEAKER: I thank you very much. (Laughter). The Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs -

MS AKOL: I thank you, Mr Speaker. I appreciate the fact that we are short of time and in accordance with the Budget Act, you have given us up to today to finish up the process of approving the budget. But at the same time, I am requesting that in accordance with the precedent laid in this House, as we receive reports being laid on Table, that Members are given copies so that when we are doing the draft appropriation Bill –

THE SPEAKER: Members, my understanding is that copies are available. You will get them. (Interjections) But hon. Members, you have heard what hon. Okello-Okello was saying about procedures in other jurisdictions. (Laughter) You have heard the contribution which the Opposition Chief Whip said. I have told you the problem of the Budget Act and I have said this before; the fact that the committees make reports on the budget should not be the end for you to debate policies and deficiencies in the ministries. I undertake to give you time in future - as I have told you, the Parliament mandate ends in May. 

I have told you that between now and May, I will give you opportune time to debate the other matters relating to ministries. 

Chairperson, Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs – 

MR KYANJO: Mr Speaker, I would be extremely surprised if the Chairperson on the Committee of Defence and Internal Affairs brought any report. We have never sat to do anything. We did not sit to write a report to bring to this House.

THE SPEAKER: Chairperson, Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs –[Hon. Members: “He is not here.”]– not here? Okay, chairperson, Committee on Foreign Affairs.

MS ANYWAR: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I do appreciate that the country needs to have all the activities running. But I have a lot of difficulty watching the House pass this Budget when there is a lot which we have not received in this House. 

I sit on the Committee on Natural Resources and I am the Shadow Minister for Water and – 

THE SPEAKER: I am talking about the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Let the chairperson come and present the report. When the Chairperson of the Committee on Natural Resources comes, you will come in –[Hon. Members: “He is not here”]- Chairperson of the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development. 

3.33
MR ROBERT KASULE (NRM, Kyadondo County North, Wakiso): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I stand here as the acting chairperson of the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development to lay on Table the report of the committee on the ministerial policy statement and budget estimates for the Financial Year 2010/2011 and the totals are herein included.

THE SPEAKER: You could read the figures.

MR KASULE: The totals for Vote 008 – Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, budget item, Recurrent Expenditure, Shs 58,584,650,000 and Development Expenditure Shs 24,301,095,388,400.

Mr Speaker, I do not have the totals, but they are in this report and I lay them on Table.

THE SPEAKER: I put the question that we adopt the report.
(Question put and agreed to.)

(Report adopted.)

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Members, in some jurisdictions - in fact in a number of them - they just give an opportunity to the Opposition to choose just one or two votes for debate; others are not debated. But maybe you have not seen this; hon. Okello-Okello gave you the example. Thank you very much hon. Okello-Okello for the expedience. (Laughter)

Let us hear from the Chairperson of the Committee on Gender, Labour and Social Development.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much. I put the question that the report be adopted.

(Question put and agreed to.)

(Report adopted.)

THE SPEAKER: Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs.

3.42
THE CHAIRPERSON, SESSIONAL COMMITTEE ON LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS (Mr Stephen Tashobya): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker and hon. Members. I beg to lay on Table a report of the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs on the ministerial policy statements for the year 2010/2011 in which the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs and the  following institutions were considered: The Electoral Commission, Uganda Law Reform Commission, Judicial Service Commission, Law Development Centre, Uganda Human Rights Commission, the Judiciary, the Directorate of Public Prosecutions, the Parliamentary Commission, Inspectorate of Government, Uganda Registration Services Bureau.

The committee proposes to this House to approve Shs 53,133,871,194 under Vote 007 for the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs.

MR OTTO ISSHA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise on a point of procedure. I agree in principle that we are passing this report and all the reports I have seen have signatures of all the Members, yet in this particular report; there is no list of names of the Members who participated in preparing and coming up with this report. (Interjections) I am telling you about the one I have.

THE SPEAKER: You will get the missing page. Please, proceed.

MR TASHOBYA: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The committee recommends that Shs 119,686,829,000 for Vote 102 for the Electoral Commission be approved. 

The committee recommends that Shs 3,069,678,000 for  Vote 105 of the Uganda Law Reform Commission be approved. (Interruption)

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am rising on a procedural issue. The Uganda Law Reform Commission has had no commissioners since 2005. This budget we want to approve is for who? Is it procedurally right to approve money for a non-existing –

THE SPEAKER: I think you are talking about different issues. The Uganda Law Reform Commission is a legal body created by the law. I think your concern was about individuals. I saw this in the newspapers recently when you had a meeting with Prof. Kakooza. Your concern is about individuals and we are talking about an institution.  Proceed.

MR TASHOBYA: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The committee recommends that Shs 2,239,918,071 for Vote 148 - Judicial Service Commission be approved. 

The committee recommends that Shs 4,044,694,000 for Vote 109 of the Law Development Centre be approved.

3.53
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr Stephen Mukitale): Mr Speaker, On behalf of the committee –(Ms Anywar rose-)

THE SPEAKER: Yes, do you have something to say?

MS ANYWAR: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I sit on the Committee on Natural Resources; I am the Shadow Minister for Water and Environment, and I represent the people of Kitgum and Lamwo districts. As I had wanted to raise it much earlier, we are presenting this report from the committee while we have not sat and concluded on any budget allocation. We have also given a condition to the Minister of Water and Environment on the issue of implementation of the ban on kaveera before we can approve her budget. We are here, bringing the committee report which is not concluded. Is it -

THE SPEAKER: What you can do, Mama -(Laughter)- is that if you are dissatisfied with what is going on in the ministry, and the budget is proposed, the figures called out, the only weapon you have is to move a motion to reduce the figure by Shs 10,000. That is the maximum measure you have on the vote. (Laughter)

MR MUKITALE: Thank you very much. On behalf of the Committee on Natural Resources, I would like to lay on Table the report, the ministerial policy statement and budget estimates for the Financial Year 2010/2011.

THE SPEAKER: If the Chairperson of the Committee on Foreign Affairs is not here, any member of that committee – 

MS ANYWAR: Mr Speaker, I am holding a copy of the report of the Committee on Natural Resources. We do not have even the list of the members who have signed and agreed or attested to this report. I have also seen -

THE SPEAKER: But you see, Madam, what I can tell you is that if there is no report by a committee on votes, I have used a votes book which was presented by the minister to extract the figures. This is what I will do. So, I will not be frustrated by non-action of the committee. I have used the minister’s proposals here and I will read the figures.

MR MUKITALE: As I said, I am doing it on behalf of the committee and this sector has four votes. The committee recommends that Parliament approves the budget estimates for the following four votes: 

Vote 017 - Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, Shs 421,264,625,000. Vote 019 - Ministry of Water and Environment, Shs 176,105,550,000. Vote 150 - National Environment Management Authority, Shs 10,884,418,000. Vote 157 - the National Forestry Authority, Shs 15,230,179,000.

I beg to lay the report on the Table.

THE SPEAKER: I put the question that the report be adopted. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

(Report adopted.)

THE VICE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON PRESIDENTIAL AFFAIRS (Mr Ibrahim Muwulize): I beg to table a report of the Committee on Presidential Affairs and the ministerial policy statement on the budget estimates for the Financial Year 2010/2011. Here they are:

Vote 001 - Office of the President, Shs 72,857,238,000; Vote 002 - State House, Shs 64,871,106,000; Vote 003 - Office of the Prime Minister, Shs 155,567,903,000; Vote 107 - Uganda AIDS Commission, Shs 14,209,590,000; Vote 112 - Ethics and Integrity, Shs 4,431,776,000; Vote 159 - External Security Organisation, Shs 10,218,040,000.

Mr Speaker, I beg to lay on Table. 

DR FRANCIS EPATAIT: Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Chairperson of the Committee on Presidential Affairs has just read the different votes under their committee, among which we had Vote 107 of the Uganda AIDS Commission. This time round, I hope Government has now listened to the voice of Parliament; that we should unlock the Uganda AIDS Commission appropriation from the Ministry of Health because originally, the Uganda AIDS Commission has been getting its appropriation through the Ministry of Health – Vote 014. I hope this time, what you have read is going directly to the Office of the President where the Uganda AIDS Commission belongs and not through the Ministry of Health. I want that assurance. 

THE SPEAKER: Well, I think both the Minister of Finance and the Leader of Government Business have heard and they will sort this out, but I think this was provided for under the HIV/AIDS committee. But the point is taken. I put the question that we adopt the report. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

(Report adopted.)

4.07
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON TOURISM, TRADE AND INDUSTRY (Mrs Mary Tuunde): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.

MRS TUUNDE: There is also the Uganda National Bureau of Standards, and the total is Shs 14,838,569,000. The grand total is Shs 55,528,660,201. I beg to move.

THE SPEAKER: I put the question that we adopt the report.

(Question put and agreed to.)

(Report adopted.)

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much. Now let us have the Committee on Social Services.

MR OYET: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise on a procedural matter. This report which is about to be tabled is not signed by any member of the committee; not even the chairperson of the committee. I have the copy of the report and there is no signature of any of the members of the committee. Are we procedurally right to proceed that way?

4.11
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SERVICES (Dr Brian Asiimwe): Mr Speaker, allow me to present the -

THE SPEAKER: The disease has been solved -(Laughter)

MS ANYWAR: Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of procedure. We have been passing budgets in this House. We have been receiving reports from the committees duly signed by the members of the committee. Is it procedurally right for the chairperson of the committee, having failed to get his or her committee members to sign up to the report, to pass a paper in this House right now and then attach it to justify that the committee members have signed? Is it procedurally right?

THE SPEAKER: I am not aware of what has been done. 

DR ASIIMWE: Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Committee on Social Services wishes to recommend to this august House, finances for the following votes: The Ministries of Education and Sports and Ministry of Health.

•	Vote 013 - Ministry of Education and Sports, Shs 391,031,76,000
•	Vote 111 - Busitema University, Shs 11,681,632,000
•	Vote 132 - Education Service Commission, Shs 5,798,378,000 -(Interruption)

DR EPETAIT: Mr Speaker, I am seeking clarification from the committee chairperson on which figure he has just read on Vote 111 of Busitema University. It is as if I heard him talk of 11 billion but the report has eight billion. Can I get some clarification on that?

DR ASIIMWE: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I think my colleague has an old copy. What I read is exclusive of non-tax revenue but the total is 11,681,632,000.

Vote 132 - Education Service Commission is Shs 5,798,378,000 and Vote 136 - Makerere University -(Interruption)

MR AMURIAT: Mr Speaker, thank you. We are dealing with figures and I think the committee chairperson needs to be consistent while presenting these figures. He has just told the House that for Vote 111 - Busitema University, the figure that is presented in the report excludes non-tax revenue. But on Vote 132, that is the Education Service Commission, he actually reads the figure that is written in the report. I think, for consistency, what needed to be printed here was the total figure that the committee is asking Parliament to pass. That way the House will understand what it is dealing with, but the way the committee chairperson is presenting his case and the committee’s case leaves room for confusion and, therefore, the House may not pass the right figures that the committee intends this House to pass. I thought I should get that clarification from the committee chairman.

THE SPEAKER: Maybe what I will do is that I will give you time and you go with him and other interested people to cross-check these figures so that we proceed with others. 

DR ASIIMWE: Thank you, Mr Speaker.  
	
THE SPEAKER: So, hon. Amuriat, please go with him and then sort this out. Thank you.

MR YIGA: Mr Speaker, when the Chairperson for the Public Service and Local Governments Committee was presenting, he omitted the section concerning the provisions for all the local governments - 

THE SPEAKER: No, he has come to me and asked for time. He has given me the total figure for local governments. He will be coming to - 

MR YIGA: Okay. I was also going to request you to allow him to correct that omission. 

THE SPEAKER: Now, what we do is to deal with Foreign Affairs. 

4.18
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Mr Alex Byarugaba): Mr Speaker, I wish to lay on Table and also present a report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for the ministries of foreign affairs and East African affairs and missions abroad. The committee critically examined the policy statements from both ministries and raised issues of response from the respective ministers - 

THE SPEAKER: No, go to the budget aspects.

MR BYARUGABA: Yes, Mr Speaker. I wish, therefore, to move that this House approves estimates for the Foreign Affairs ministry and missions abroad for the financial year 2010/2011 as follows: 

Vote 006 - Ministry of Foreign Affairs

Recurrent expenditure -  	Shs 16,805,289,000 
Development expenditure -  Shs	928,591,000
Total  -	Shs 	17,733,880,000

Vote 201 to 232 - Missions Abroad

Recurrent expenditure - Shs 52,620,031,000

Recurrent expenditure - Shs 15,320,439,000
Development expenditure - Shs 280,000,000
Total - Shs 15,600,439,000

Mr Speaker, I beg to move.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much, Chairman. I put the question that the report be adopted.

(Question put and agreed to.)

(Report adopted.)

THE SPEAKER: Now, the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs.

4.21
THE VICE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE AND INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr Milton Muwuma): Mr Speaker, this is the report of the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs on the ministerial policy statements for the financial year 2010/2010.

MR KYANJO: Mr Speaker, I was satisfied when you said that we would rather use the ministerial policy statement figures rather than the committee reports because as I had earlier indicated, the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs has never sat to write this report and any God-fearing member of that committee can stand - Mr Kasamba is there - he can stand up and attest to whether he actually sat in any single meeting to write this report.

Secondly, even if we are to go by the ministerial policy statement, we would only be able to succeed with defence. So, we will have to stand over the Ministry of Internal Affairs because we discovered that the ministerial policy statement of the Ministry of Internal Affairs had major flaws and it was extremely repaired before we were supposed to write the final report. So, unless we are here simply to pass time, I stand here to defend the ministries, but also to defend the dignity of this House. So, I would beg that we go by the figures of the ministerial policy statement on the Ministry of Defence and stand over the Ministry of Internal Affairs so that we can harmonise it and bring it back to Parliament before we mess it up. Thank you, sir.

MR MUWUMA: Thank you so much. Mr Speaker, the report being presented has been signed by six Members. Hon. Kyanjo refused to sign the report.

THE SPEAKER: I see -

MR KYANJO: Mr Speaker, I have been an available Member of Parliament at the service of the chair all the time. Let the chair find a decent way of escaping this problem. I did not refuse to sign the report; in any case I was not invited for any meeting.

THE SPEAKER: You declined.

MR KYANJO: I did not decline. There was no meeting of that nature, Mr Speaker. This is just for the record. Let Parliament do whatever it wants but the chairperson is just making serious allegations which are untrue and I am wondering whether the Member is really in order.

THE SPEAKER: I do not know how I am supposed to rule on this because the chairperson says the report has been signed by six members and that is the minimum requirement which has been met. We shall investigate other issues. (Laughter)

MR MUWUMA: Thank you so much, Mr Speaker. 

Vote 004 - Ministry of Defence

Mr Speaker, the figures presented do not include the corrigenda that has been presented today. Just like you referred it to the committee, the committee will be going through it and will report thereafter. I beg to report.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you. I now put the question that the report be adopted.

(Question put and agreed to.)

(Report adopted.)

(Mr Kyanjo rose_)

THE SPEAKER: We shall investigate. (Laughter) I will undertake the investigation.

MR KYANJO: Mr Speaker, thank you very much for your guidance and in support of your ruling and for ease of investigations, I would beg that the Member comes back on the Floor and reads the names of the members who signed the report.

THE SPEAKER: Okay. Now, can I call the Chairperson, Committee on Public Service and Local Government to deal with the districts?

4.29
THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SERVICE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Capt. John Emilly Otekat): Mr Speaker, while I was presenting the budget proposals for Ministry of Public Service, Public Service Commission, Ministry of Local Government and the Local Government Finance Commission, the local governments of Uganda budgets were not submitted. I would now like to submit.

Vote 501 to 850 of local governments of Uganda that includes the districts of Uganda and the municipalities. Amount of funds requested by local governments for financial year 2010/2011 is:

Recurrent expenditure - Shs 1,098,281,498,000
Development expenditure - Shs 391,726,758,000. 
The sub-total required by all local governments in Uganda is Shs 1,490,008,256,000. The grand total for all the ministries under my committee and commissions is Shs 1,975,018,531,619. I beg to move, Mr Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Okay. The question is that we adopt the report as summarised. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

Report adopted.

THE SPEAKER: Report of the Committee on Social Services not yet ready – yes, hon. Dr Asiimwe.

4.31
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SERVICES (Dr Brian Asiimwe): Mr Speaker, I am sorry for delaying. The problem was that the report that Members have came before corrigenda II and the one I have is after corrigenda II; it has the right figures. I only request honourable members to adjust the figures shown in their copies of the first report.

THE SPEAKER: We must thank hon. Amuriat for drawing our attention to that. Thank you very much. (Applause)

DR ASIIMWE: Mr Speaker, I would like to start with:

Mr Speaker, I beg to lay the report on Table.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much, Chairman. Yes, Hon. Wadri.

MR WADRI: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I just want some clarifications on the figures. We have received a set of papers entitled, “Appropriation by votes” but under Vote 116 for National Medical Stores, no figure for Development Expenditure has been given. That part is just blank. Can we reconcile this so that when at the end of the day Parliament is to use these documents to pronounce itself on the overall budget, we do not miss out the development budget proportion. I do not know whether you have this document. What I am saying is that the Development Budget for National Medical Stores – look at Vote 116 – the development budget for Medical Stores is missing yet at the end of the day we shall need it as Parliament to pronounce ourselves for the overall budget for all government institutions.

DR ASIIMWE: Mr Speaker –

THE SPEAKER: No, the question is: Do you have a figure for development expenditure in respect of this particular –

DR ASIIMWE: No, we have no figure for development fund for National Medical Stores.

THE SPEAKER: Could either the Minister of Finance or that of health tell us whether this was intentional or it was just an oversight?

MR OMACH: Mr Speaker, to my knowledge we do not provide them with a development budget.

THE SPEAKER: You don’t – it is okay. 

DR NDUHUURA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I know National Medical Stores purchases vehicles for distribution of medicines and other health supplies so if we don’t indicate it here then I am really at a loss.

THE SPEAKER: Maybe it has a way of generating resources for capital development.

DR NDUHUURA: I need to be advised by the Minister of Finance. I know there is a commission, which is charged -

THE SPEAKER: Well, we are not dealing with the Appropriation Bill yet. Between now and when we deal with the Appropriation Bill, which really ties up what we do, we shall sort this out. 

In the same way, the committee on Defence says there is a corrigendum which was brought here, but we are told it concerns our soldiers in Somalia. They need money, so between now and the Appropriation Bill, please deal with this so that at that time we shall adjust the figures to include it in the Appropriation Bill.

Minister of Defence, do you have anything to say? Because you heard the chairperson saying that because the thing had just been brought there, they had not included it, but I am asking them to deal with it as soon as possible so that before we seal the appropriation by the Appropriation Bill, this figure is included.

DR CRISPUS KIYONGA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. In the appropriation by vote, we have been issued a draft and that adjustment has been made. Nevertheless, between now and appropriation, we shall meet the committee to give details.

THE SPEAKER: Okay, thank you. Otherwise, hon. Members, I want to thank you. We have dealt with the reports and, therefore, complied with Section 9 of the Budget Act.

MR KYANJO: Mr Speaker, you are on record, having agreed to my request for the chairperson to come and read the signatories. He is back, sir. I beg for your indulgence that he reads the names out.

THE SPEAKER: Is there any problem?

MR MUWUMA: Mr Speaker, I trust hon. Kyanjo’s sight and I have availed him with another copy that has Members who signed so it doesn’t – At least he wanted to get the members who signed. They are six members and I wanted to avail him with another copy so he can rest his case.

Mr Speaker, the committee is chaired by hon. Kamba Saleh who signed. I am the vice chairman of the committee; hon. Milton Muwuma and I signed. Hon. Silver Bahane Niyibizi from Bufumbira signed. We also have hon. Tom Kazibwe who signed, hon. Mathias Kasamba from Kakuuto who signed and hon. Johnson Malinga who also signed.

THE SPEAKER: Okay, thank you. Now, hon. Members, having received the reports under Section 9, and having carried the motion to resolve ourselves into a Committee of Supply, I think it is time that we go into Committee of Supply.

COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY

Vote 001 - Office of the President, recurrent expenditure.

THE CHAIRMAN: Hon. Members, I put the question that the total sum of Shs 56,659,272,000 be provided for under Vote 001 - Office of the President as recurrent expenditure for fiscal year 2010/2011.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Vote 001 - Office of the President, development expenditure.

THE CHAIRMAN: Hon. Members, I put the question that the total sum of Shs 16,197,966,006 be provided for under Vote 001 - Office of the President as development expenditure for fiscal year 2010/2011.

MS AKOL: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I am seeking clarification from you. I am looking at the report; the draft appropriation and the figures both for recurrent and development, and the figures don’t tally with what you are reading. So, I don’t know where the Clerk’s Department got their figures from. I am seeking clarification to that effect. Thank you.

THE CHAIRMAN: I think it must have been rounded up to the nearest one thousand and that is all.

MS AKOL: Thank you, Mr Chairman. For example, development expenditure in the report for Vote 001 reads Shs 14,000,657,000 while here in the draft appropriation it reads Shs 16 billion. So, there is a difference of Shs 2 billion. This is the draft appropriation report we got from the Clerk’s Office. I am comparing the draft appropriation report with the report of the committee and the figures don’t tally.

THE CHAIRMAN: I understand the committee must have left out the taxation aspect, which must be included. So, since the chairman has agreed, I now put the question.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Vote 002 - State House, recurrent expenditure

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that the total sum of Shs 57,773,526,000 be provided for under Vote 002 - State House as recurrent expenditure for fiscal year 2010/2011.

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that a total sum of Shs 58,548,650,000 be provided under Vote 008 - Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development, as recurrent expenditure for fiscal year 2010/2011.

MR FRED OMACH: Mr Chairman, when we met the parliamentary committee on finance, they requested to make some adjustments on our budget. The first was on Shs 3.95 billion to be reallocated to the Office of the Auditor-General. They wanted Shs 0.45 billion to be transferred to NPAT, Shs 2 billion relocated from funds provided for tax reforms and then Shs 1.5 billion be reallocated from the custodian board. The response is that this Shs 2 billion is to cater for critical activities under the tax policy department of the ministry of finance and then the custodian body that has been given Shs 0.2 billion to cater for salaries. Our figure for these particular votes under Ministry of Finance would read Shs 57,598,650,000.

THE CHAIRMAN: Since you are not increasing and you are reducing, I have nothing to say so read it slowly so that they can hear. 

MR OMACH: Shs 57,598,650,000.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay. So the figures are adjusted as the minister says. So I put the question that a total sum of Shs 57,598,650,000 be provided for under vote 008, Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development, as recurrent expenditure for fiscal year 2010/2011.
 
(Question put and agreed to.)

MR KYANJA:  I thank you, Mr Chairman. I beg for your indulgence that this vote is huge and it is not an entire ministry but just a department which is the ministry headquarters and as you have already ruled that this whole thing is going under an investigation, I do not know what we are going to do. With your guidance, I would beg that you deal with Vote 009 and Vote 120 which are still under question.

THE CHAIRMAN: Now what we do is that the Rules of Procedure have provided for the remedy or the missile you use against a ministry which you are not happy with and you move a motion of reducing the figure by Shs 10,000 and that is the maximum you can do – those are our rules.

MR KYANJA: I beg to move that we reduce that figure by Shs 10,000.

MR AMURIAT: Mr Chairman, I am concerned over the way we are dealing with taxes because the figures that you are reading exclude taxes. When you look at the details of the report by the Committee on Infrastructure for the Ministry of Works and Transport – 

THE CHAIRMAN: Minister of Finance, this is a question you have to answer. Hon. Amuriat, I understand you are a member of the committee; how did you deal with this?

MR AMURIAT: Well, we were not privy to the preparation of the appropriation votes; I think it is the Department of Clerks that did it. I just wanted clarification from the Minister of Finance on how we are going to handle taxes. From what I see here, the figures that are being read seem to be exclusive of taxes. 

MS AKOL: Mr Chairman, if you refer to the report from the committee, there is a line for taxes after development and it is part of development expenditure. So, it is catered for.

THE CHAIRMAN: So, I put the question.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Vote 101 - Judiciary 

MR AMURIAT: Mr Chairman, I get worried when I notice that there is no recurrent expenditure for Vote 101 all the way down to Vote 108. What this means to me is that we are not paying salaries for the Judiciary, for Members of Parliament and for the Inspectorate of Government. I do not know whether this is a mere omission. I am very worried, especially when I see the Parliamentary Commission not having any figure in its recurrent expenditure. I think this needs to be clarified. If we do not appropriate recurrent expenditure for these departments, there will be no salaries and other allowances for people working under these authorities, commissions and organisations. I thought my friend the Minister of Finance –

THE CHAIRMAN: Well, the institutions you mentioned as examples are privileged in that their recurrent expenditures are a direct charge on the Consolidated Fund. They are privileged institutions. I think I am clear. 

I put the question that the total sum of Shs 9,334,800,000 be provided for under Vote 101 - Judiciary, as development expenditure for fiscal year 2010/2011. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

Vote 102 - Electoral Commission

(Question put and agreed to.)

Vote 104 - Parliamentary Commission 

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that the total sum of Shs 11,819,792,000 be provided for under Vote 104 - Parliamentary Commission, as development expenditure for fiscal year 2010/2011.

(Question put and agreed to.)

MR WADRI: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. The figure of Shs 11.8 billion is being proposed to be allocated to the Parliamentary Commission for development undertaking. I am aware of the fact that there has been a longstanding plan to have new chambers for this institution, more so with the creation of new constituencies, districts and the rest of it. Certainly, in the next parliament, those who will make it will not be able to fit in these chambers. Is this amount of money inclusive of the plan to lay the foundation for the new chambers? How far will it take care of this? Has there been a separate arrangement made taking into account construction of the new chambers? I just need some explanation on that. 

THE CHAIRMAN: Well, I do not know, but I think the development you are talking about is likely to be staggered, in the sense that they are going to start with certain structures, for instance, the parking. They will not start with the construction before the parking because there will be a problem of parking. So, the development will include parking, then after that the chambers behind. I do not know, but it is not likely to be completed within one financial year.

MR AMURIAT: Mr Chairman, following on that, I know that it was estimated that construction of new chambers would cost up to Shs 20 billion. I appreciate that as we go to the next parliament, there is need for us to have parking. We are going to have about 400 MPs and I am not sure how - assuming you will be the Speaker - you will be able to house all those people even if you had enough room for parking. I do not know if it is too late, Sir, for something to be done about this. I know it is possible to construct the chambers over two financial years, but there is also no guarantee that we shall have all the Shs 20 billion plus in the next financial year; that is 2011/2012. I would like to seek the indulgence of the Minister of Finance.

THE CHAIRMAN: Certainly, at the beginning there will be inconvenience, because as I have told you, the new parliament will be in place in the second half of May. Definitely, nothing will have been done by then, but these were conditions for approving the plan of constructing the chamber where it is supposed to be - that you have to provide for parking. Parking is a condition for approval of the plan to construct the other one. However, at the end of the day, since there is a commitment that we should have a new chamber, I think that will come. That is the best I can say about that.

MS FLORENCE IBI EKWAU: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I am very glad that Members are raising these concerns. It is at this time that we really implore Government, especially the Leader of Government Business, that we need your total commitment on this. 

There is no point of having the number of Members of Parliament swell when the pace of catering for the new chambers is not fast. There have been efforts towards that but we hope and believe that those efforts will bear fruits and the next parliament will not be suffocated. I hope we shall not have Universal Primary Education (UPE) extended in Parliament and have Members of Parliament squeezed like sardines. I will be very glad if Government took this as total commitment as we are passing and approving this Budget and that you will treat honourable members as Members of Parliament not as pupils in primary school. Thank you very much.

THE CHAIRMAN: I think the record has been captured and the Leader of Government Business and the Minister of Finance have heard. Please, address this problem because it is going to affect the efficiency of Members of Parliament. Thank you. I put the question.

Vote 108 – National Planning Authority

MR OYET: Mr Chairman, under Vote 108 - on page 26 of the report of the Committee on Finance and Planning there is a provision for Shs 7,105,600,000 as recurrent budget but it is not reflected here.

THE CHAIRMAN: But the vote I have here is development not recurrent.

MR OYET: That is why I am trying to seek clarification on why the recurrent expenditure is not reflected.

THE CHAIRMAN: Recall the explanation I gave earlier. I put the question that a total sum of Shs 2,569,886,000 be provided for under Vote 108 National Planning Authority, as development expenditure for fiscal year 2010/2011. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

Vote 109 - Law Development Centre
THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that a total sum of Shs 1,178,694,000 be provided for under Vote 109 - Law Development Centre, as recurrent expenditure for fiscal year 2010/2011. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that a total sum of Shs 2,866,000,000 be provided for under Vote 109 - Law Development Centre, as development expenditure for fiscal year 2010/2011. 

MR OMACH: Mr Chairman and colleagues, this is non-tax revenue which we expect them to expend at source and should not be appropriated.

THE CHAIRMAN: So, I do not read it?

MR OMACH: No, you do not read it, Sir.

Vote 110 – Uganda Industrial Research Institute

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that the total sum of Shs 5,733,000,000 be provided for under Vote 110 - Uganda Industrial Research Institute, for recurrent expenditure for fiscal year 2010/2011. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that the total sum of Shs 8,230,000,000 be provided for under Vote 110 - Uganda Industrial Research Institute, under development expenditure for the fiscal year 2010/2011. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

Vote 111 - Busitema University 

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that the total sum of Shs 6,954,111,000 be provided for under Vote 111 - Busitema University, as recurrent expenditure for fiscal year 2010/2011 - 

MR OMACH: Thank you, Mr Chairman. This figure includes non-tax revenue which is supposed to be utilised at source when collected and this is affecting all the universities and other tertiary institutions. So, the right figure which excludes the NTR would read as follows: Shs 6,604,111,000.

MS FLORENCE IBI EKWAU: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. What the Minister of Finance is doing is bogging down the speed at which we are moving. I would implore that he corrects all the figures that involve tax such that we have the right figures at once other than stopping the process in the middle. I would appreciate that effort. Thank you very much. 

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, so the figure to which I put the question is Shs 6,604,111,000 to be provided for under Vote 111 - Busitema University, as recurrent expenditure for fiscal year 2010/2011. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE CHAIRMAN: In other words you are saying that you will make corrections to these figures.

MR OMACH: For all the tertiary institutions, we have corrections because they had included the NTR to be appropriated and yet the Universities and Other Tertiary Institutions Act allows them to collect and use at source. So, this affects Makerere University, Mbarara University of Science and Technology, Makerere University Business School, Kyambogo University, Uganda Management Institute, Gulu University and the Uganda Bureau of Statistics. 

THE CHAIRMAN: Just fish out those and make corrections to them.

MR WADRI: Mr Chairman, if the minister has got the corrected figures at his finger tips, how would the process be if we asked him to tell us those changes so that when we go to appropriate votes, we do not have to be bogged down by him standing up one after the other to bring in the changes? So, he could be given time to liaise with his technocrats and bring the corrected figures and we pronounce ourselves on them at once.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, I think let us suspend the proceedings for 10 minutes. 

MR AMURIAT: Mr Chairman, I think we probably have to take note of those votes that would be affected by non-tax revenue just to keep them, and continue with the others where there is nothing to be corrected. At the end of the day, we come back to them. If you suspend the House for even five minutes, Members will go away and they will not return. 

THE CHAIRMAN: Let us proceed with the development aspects because your corrections were on recurrent expenditures. 

Vote 111 - Busitema University

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that the total sum of Shs 7,048,405,000 be provided for under vote 120, Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control, as recurrent expenditure for fiscal year 2010/2011.

MR ARUMADRI: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I am given to learn that this amount of money was meant to train staff that would be operating the biometric machines. However, this exercise is now being undertaken by the Electoral Commission. To me the inclusion of this figure will appear to be double counting and provision of funding where an exercise is already being undertaken by another arm of Government. Will the minister explain this, Sir? Thank you.

MR OMACH: Mr Chairman, the Ministry of Internal Affairs will still have a responsibility to undertake some training.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, but I think the Auditor-General will help if it is misused definitely. He is our eye. 

MR WADRI: Mr Chairman, hon. John Nasasira is happy because he has just come out victorious after having punched other people mercilessly, but we also fear, to be very frank with you, Mr Chairman. This is a very crucial time in the political history of this country where we need to know if each and every coin is going to be used for the purpose for which it is meant. If the biometric exercise of registration is already being undertaken and we are here voting this surmountable amount of money, we just cannot take it lightly. We cannot take it lightly. 

We can come up and say we are going to rely on the goodwill, efficiency and transparency of the Auditor-General, but by that time, the water will have gone under the bridge. We want to see to it that this water does not flow under the bridge when we are watching. So, we need more conviction on this.

MR AMURIAT: Mr Chairman, we appropriate money in this House knowing that it will be spent. I do not see any reason why we should appropriate this large sum of money knowing that the activity for which we seek to appropriate this money for is already being carried out. Probably, the wisest thing to do, if we really want to spend this money, would be to find out where to put it - in water or education or health where it is more needed. Here, under the Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration, this money is not required and so what we are simply saying is that this House deserves an explanation to this. This could even do a number of roads under the Ministry of Works and Transport. “Why should we appropriate this figure?” is the good question we are trying to ask.

MR YIGA: Mr Chairman, I can see we are actually mixing issues here. The Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration is concerned with citizens of Uganda and the Electoral Commission is concerned with voters from 18 years and above - those who wish to be voters. I think the directorate also has a lot to play here to ensure that it keeps track of the citizens of this country from maybe age zero up to the time when the Electoral Commission can capture them as voters. So, I think they actually have a role to play in ensuring that they keep track and register all citizens of Uganda. Thank you.

MR NASASIRA: Much as I was referred to, and I need more money for roads, -(Laughter)- I have failed to understand whether the colleagues who are raising issues on this money under recurrent, think there is no need for a recurrent budget for the Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control. Definitely, it has work and it needs recurrent money in order to be there.

THE CHAIRMAN: I think the Auditor-General will definitely check on the misuse of this money. Maybe what we can do is to ask the minister concerned to give us the details before the appropriation is really done, because we shall deal with the Appropriation Bill. I think between now and that time, we shall be able to find out. Recurrent means paying staff, doing this and the other. The exercise which was conducted was conducted for the voters, but as hon. Yiga has said, some people did not go there, but they may need the identity cards and it is a continuous process. However, I think it should not bog us down. Let us vote the money, but between now and appropriation, they will get a detailed explanation.

MR WADRI: Mr Chairman, I will buy your advice if it can be a commitment that before we reach the appropriation stage, the relevant minister comes with the detailed breakdown of how this money is going to be used -(Interjections)- If that can be done, then we will accept.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay. So, I now put the question.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Vote 131 - Auditor-General

MR OMACH: Mr Chairman, Vote 130 is Treasury operations which was given Shs 2 billion for the contingency fund, but the Committee on Finance thought that since the law is not yet there, this amount should be transferred to the office of the Auditor-General. We think that this amount should continue to remain there and we are in the process of finalising this law and the contingency fund will actually need much more money than this. The Auditor-General’s office has been given sufficient funds which —

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable, the vote in my hand is 131 - Auditor- General. 

MR OMACH: Mr Chairman, when we met the committee, they decided to remove this money -

THE CHAIRMAN: From Auditor-General?

MR OMACH: From the Treasury operations - Shs 2 billion - and transferred it to Auditor-General. Now we are saying that we need this money to be reflected under Vote 130, which is Treasury operations, for the contingency fund.

THE CHAIRMAN: But where is that Vote 130? Where is it? I have not been handling 130. I do not have it. It has not come yet. Maybe it is somewhere.

MR OMACH: Our submission to Parliament included Vote 130, which is Treasury function under —

THE CHAIRMAN: I entirely agree with you, but what I have at hand here is 131.

MR OMACH: Mr Chairman, as I have said, the report -

THE CHAIRMAN: What I suggest is that we complete what I have meanwhile they are preparing some document on 130.

I put the question that a total sum of Shs 1,714,588,000 be provided for under Vote 131 - Auditor-General, as development expenditure for fiscal year 2010/2011.

MR OMACH: Mr Chairman, sorry to take you back. We provided Shs 2.0 billion last financial year under supplementary budget for purposes of population and housing census and under this year’s budget we have given an additional Shs 3.0 billion.

Vote 159 - External Security Organisation, Development Expenditure

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that a total sum of Shs 442,000,000 –

MR OYET: I thank you, Mr Chairman. On page 5 of the report of the Agriculture Committee, there has been recommendation that Shs 2.0 billion, which was meant for renting and acquiring private premises for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, be relocated to popularize the coffee growing in Northern Uganda - and it is actually one of the crop that has drawn attention - but it is not captured here. 

I wanted to seek clarification from the Ministry of Finance whether there is going to be supplementary or maybe there is going to be some fund allocation into that aspect because as we talk today, coffee growing is actually picking up so fast in Northern Uganda and as I talk today, the districts of Amuru and Gulu have embarked on coffee growing and being the area that is recovering from the war, we really feel that it is such kinds of initiatives that should be supported.

THE CHAIRMAN: But legally, can the committee do that?

MR OYET: That is what I wanted to seek clarification on.

THE CHAIRMAN: No. The committee cannot legally do it. Legally, it can at an earlier stage suggest this and the other but having read the budget, it cannot do it.

MOTION FOR THE HOUSE TO RESUME

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question.

(Question put and agreed to.)

(The House resumed, the Speaker presiding_)

REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY

7.01
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Fred Omach): Mr Speaker, I beg to report that the Committee of Supply has considered the budget proposal for the financial year 2010/11 and has passed it with some amendments.  

MOTION FOR ADOPTION OF THE REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY

7.02
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Fred Omach): Mr Speaker, I beg to move that the report from the Committee of Supply be adopted.

THE SPEAKER: I now put the question.

(Question put and agreed to.)

(Report adopted.)

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much! (Applause) I am very happy that we have been able to handle this exercise. I have been happy with the good understanding we had when we started and it has prevailed. Although we have been toiling in the constituencies and elsewhere, you have the energy that has enabled you to accomplish what we have accomplished today. 

Now the worries are dealing with the other Bills supporting the budget: the finance Bills, amendments, this and the other. I hope the committees will embark on this and by the end of the week, complete their reports so that next week we are able to completely seal what we have done. 

Somebody was talking about the Parliamentary Gardens. Personally, I think you are justified to ask for that. I am directing the relevant authorities in Parliament to promptly arrange it so that we go and talk about what we have done. (Laughter) 

Now I do not know. What do we do? Should we give committees two or three days to polish up the reports? I think what we should do is to adjourn to Tuesday so that during these days, you finish because there are a number of Bills, which were tabled here to support the budget process.

7.03
MS ROSE AKOL (NRM, Woman Representative, Bukedea): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I think it is good timing. Today, we have considered the report on Foreign Affairs and Members do not have copies as much as we have looked at it -(Interruptions)

THE SPEAKER: Okay, they will get it -

MS AKOL: So, I am requesting that it is provided to Members so - 

THE SPEAKER: No, Members will be provided with copies. You will get a copy Madam –

MS AKOL: There is one report, which is missing. We do not have it.

THE SPEAKER: But now do we agree that between now and Tuesday we will have finished all the reports on the Bills?

MS AKOL: Mr Speaker, that is fine. I am also requesting Finance that by Tuesday as we resume, we do away with the Supplementary Appropriation Bill before we go ahead and finalise with the Appropriation Bill for 2010/11. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Is it agreed. Hon. Minister, do you have something to say?

7.04
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Fred Omach): We shall oblige with her request.

THE SPEAKER: Okay, do we adjourn to Tuesday morning or in the afternoon? Okay, with that we come to the end of today’s business, which I believe has been done well. We adjourn the House to Tuesday at 2.00 p.m.

(The House rose at 7.05 p.m. and was adjourned to Tuesday, 21 September 2010 at 2.00 p.m.)
