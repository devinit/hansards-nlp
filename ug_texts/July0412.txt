Parliament met at 2.17 p.m. in Parliament House, Kampala.

PRAYERS

(The Deputy Speaker, Mr Jacob Oulanyah, in the Chair.)

The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Good afternoon, honourable members. You are welcome to this sitting. Yesterday I made some orders in relation to ministerial policy statements and today I see 13 of them due to be laid before the House. I had ordered that by tomorrow all the policy statements should be on the Order Paper. For the ministries that will not show up with their ministerial policy statements by tomorrow, the records will show such failure. That is the order I made yesterday and that order stands. Today we will be receiving some policy statements.

Secondly, there are ministerial statements that have been outstanding for a long time. I do not want to single out any particular ministry but you know yourselves. Honourable ministers, we want these statements brought to the House and debated so that they are cleared and we move forward with no backlog. The ministries responsible are aware; I will not single you out, and there have been correspondences on this issue.

Thirdly, there have been a series of questions for oral answer and the members are getting agitated that they file questions and they are not responded to. That is the reason they are resorting to matters of national importance because they cannot find recourse in the ministerial statements that should be giving more comprehensive responses to issues that affect the people of this country. So, those should come. 

If we are able to work together this week and the next week, we should be able to finish this entire backlog. We have already received the text of the State of the Nation Address by His Excellency the President and we are hoping we will have time to deal with this immediately we finish with this backlog, so that we can have a comprehensive debate on the State of the Nation Address and then also the budget. So we have quite a handful and we need everybody’s cooperation and urgent timely action so that we can deliver on our purposes as given to us by the Constitution. Thank you very much.

PRESENTATION OF A PETITION ON ANTI-CHILD SACRIFICE AND RITUAL MURDER OF CHILDREN

2.23
MS FLORENCE MUTYABULE (NRM, Woman Representative, Namutumba): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Under rule 30 of the Rules of Procedure of the Parliament of Uganda, to the Parliament of Uganda: 

The humble petition of the former students of the International School of Uganda against child sacrifice and ritual murders presented by hon. Mutyabule Florence Tibafana, MP Namutumba District -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, has the numbering of the rules been changed now, because it has always been rule 27? Are they re-numbered subsequent to the amendment to the rules? This is because yesterday I again cited rule 30 and today the honourable member is citing rule 30, and it is coming from the legal department. I am not sure whether they have already harmonised; I need to know because the substantive rule for petitions should be rule 27. I do not know whether it has been re-numbered subsequently making it rule 30. When we do not have the formal new rules published, we will go by these ones, so you go by rule 27.

MS MUTYABULE: Most obliged, Mr Speaker. Under rule 27 of the Rules of Procedure of the Parliament of Uganda, to the Parliament of Uganda: 

The humble petition of the former students of the International School of Uganda against child sacrifice and ritual murders presented by hon. Mutyabule Florence Tibafana, MP Namutumba District. 

SHOWETH AND STATES that: 

1. 	Your petitioners are former students of the International School of Uganda who are concern about child and human sacrifice that has hit different parts of the country.

2. 	The 1995 Constitution of Uganda provides for the right to life under Article 22 and recognises the right of a child to know and be cared for by their parents or those entitled by law to bring them up under Article 34, Clause 1.

3. 	A child, under the Convention of the Rights of the Child, means a human being below the age of 18 years and requires parties to respect and ensure the rights of each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child’s parents or legal guardians’ race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status.

4. 	The Children’s Act, under Section 2, defines a child as a person below the age of 18 years and requires every local government council to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and mediate in any situation where the rights of a child are infringed within its area.

5. 	Children, despite being one of the vulnerable groups, are not receiving enough protection against sacrifice.

6. 	Currently, a wave of child sacrifice has hit different parts of the country with several media reports on child sacrifice, leaving their wellbeing endangered.

7. 	Your humble petitioners initiated a project, Art for Social Change, whose aim was to raise awareness for the fight against the horrific phenomenon of child sacrifice, which was supported by a series of prominent Ugandan personalities including His Excellency the Vice-President, Edward Sekandi, hon. Janet Museveni, and the Inspector General of Police, Kale Kayihura, among others.

NOW THEREFORE by this petition, the petitioners pray that Parliament resolves that:

1. 	A new legislation be enacted to regulate traditional healers.

2. 	The Witchcraft Act, which is out-dated, be reviewed.

3. 	The sensitisation of parents, child minders, community leaders and schools about their roles and responsibilities of looking after children be carried out.

4. 	Public sensitisation and education about lack of validity in witchcraft beliefs be done. 

And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray and hereto, your humble petitioners have appended their signatures. 
I beg to lay.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let the records capture that. Do you have the list of the signatures attached to the petition?

MRS MUTYABULE: Yes, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much. It stands committed to the Committee on Social Services to act on it within the rules and report back to the House so that the House can take appropriate decisions on the matter – (Interjections) - Committee on Gender? Okay, it stands committed to the appropriate committee. It is up to the people to sort it out.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, you should also address the House because at the time it was called, they waited for you. 

MR AMOOTI OTADA: Most obliged, Mr Speaker.  I want to thank you, Mr Speaker and honourable members. I want to present this petition from the concerned victims of the Revolutionary Freedom Fighters. It sounds controversial, but this is a group of Nubians who were resettled in Masindi Port in a village called Kimyonka. They were not fully resettled with a resettlement package. So, they are basically asking for reparations to be resettled with packages like iron sheets and compensation for the lost income and property. They are asking for a technical school to be constructed. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are those the prayers?

MR AMOOTI OTADA: These are the prayers, Mr Speaker. They are also asking for a tractor and agricultural implements to be provided to them by way of resettlement. The petition has been signed by 193 petitioners and I wish to lay it on the Table.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let the records capture that. It stands committed to the appropriate committee for action within the framework of the rules. We expect a decision from the committee to come back to the House and Parliament can take a decision on it. Thank you.  

QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER

QUESTION 28/1/09 TO THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL INDUSTRY AND FISHERIES

2.59
MR FRED BADDA (NRM, Bujumba County, Kalangala): “(i) When will Government operationalise the Fisheries Fund?
ii) 	What efforts has Government made to implement the registration of the fisher-folk and fishing vessels?
iii) 	When does the minister intend to bring an amendment to the Fish Act, CAP 196, to streamline among others, the relationship between the sector ministry, local authorities and fisheries management authorities?”

2.59
THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL INDUSTRY AND FISHERIES (Mr Tress Buchanayandi): Mr Speaker, I wish to respond to the following oral questions raised by hon. Badda Fred, MP Bujumba County: 

Question 1: When will Government operationalize the Fisheries Fund? 

The fisheries fund is provided for under Article 153(2) of the Constitution, section 2 (2)(a) of the Fish Act, and section 9(1) of the Public Finance and Accountability Act, 2003. It is the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development who issues the statutory instrument for the establishment of the fund. However, the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development in their letter replying to ours, No. 46/25601 dated 31 November 2001 and signed by the Permanent Secretary, objected to the establishment of the fund. 

Question 2: What efforts has Government made to implement the registration of the fisheries folk and fishing vessels? 

The Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries has reviewed the Fish (Fishing) Rules, 2010, and provided for the registration of fisher folk and fishing vessels, including permanent markings of the vessels. The licensing of fisheries and fishing vessels is on-going. However, it is greatly constrained by limited funding. 

The Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) requested the Ministry of Finance for funding to the tune of Shs 3 billion to support the exercise, via our letter No.462206 dated 13 March 2012. This was to cater for the procurement of vessel identification plates for 22,400 fishing vessels at Shs 1.7 billion, and for mobilisation, sensitisation, supervision, support to local government and support to enforcement to ensure compliance. The amount of Shs 3 billion would then be accounted for by way of fisheries licensing fees collected. 

Question 3: When does the minister intend to bring an amendment to the Fish Act, CAP 196, to streamline, among others, the relationship between the sector ministry, local authorities and fisheries management authorities? 

The draft Fisheries Bill was deferred with recommendation to develop new principles. The same is now undergoing wider consultation with industry stakeholders. The Beach Management Units, the district local governments and the Uganda Fish Processing and Exporters Association (UFPEA) have each articulated their perceived roles and interests. As expected, there remain many areas of contest as to levels of control and enforcement as well as the matter of control or sharing of revenues from control and enforcement activities. 

Our projection is to be able to resolve the stakeholder’s differences and to table the Fisheries Bill during the current year. Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

3.03
MR FRED BADDA (NRM, Bujumba County, Kalangala): Mr Speaker, I want to raise three supplementary questions. What were the major reasons given by the Ministry of Finance to object to the fund, which are in total disregard of the Constitution, the Fisheries Act and the Accountability and the Finance Act? We did not read that letter, but since you read the letter you should know the reasons. So, can the reasons be told to this Parliament?

Secondly, don’t you think this is one way of oppressing the fishermen by refusing to establish a fisheries fund? Money is being collected and there are also a number of taxes put on the fishing folks; whereas it should have been better to have one tax put in a fund, there is a duplication of taxes.

On the licences, as you may be aware since last year money has been collected from the fishermen but licences have not been given to them. So, what is the status? Are these licences going to be annual or perennial? If they are annual, what is going to happen to those fisher persons whose money was collected last year and they did not get their licences?

Finally, I request the ministry to urgently honour this assurance of overhauling the Fisheries Act to solve the many problems that are in the fisheries sector. Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

3.05
MR TIMOTHY LWANGA (NRM, Kyamuswa County, Kalangala): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to concentrate on question No.2 and the answer that the minister is giving. I want to bring it to the attention of this House that the fishing folk is being mistreated. When the minister refers to procurement of vessel identification plates, he is referring to what they call number plates for identifying the boats or vessels. Unfortunately, according to the arrangement of the ministry, they are supposed to pay for number plates every year. So my question is: people buy motor vehicles and pay for number plates once in a life time, why should fishermen have to pay for licences every year? That is very unfair treatment and it is not equity. 

Secondly, the fishing folk pay what is equivalent to a road licence annually and yet in Kampala and all over Uganda people who have motor vehicles do not pay for road licences because they pay taxes on fuel. Fishermen spend more money on buying fuel than any other community in this country. Again, there is lack of equity. 

Mr Speaker, later on, we are going to come here to demand that the fishermen stop paying for an equivalent of a road licence because they pay more taxes on fuel than other folks. Thank you Mr Speaker. 

3.07
MR PETER OKEYOH (NRM, Bukooli Island County, Namayingo): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me this opportunity. I also have more questions to the minister. He has talked of having number plates, but the lake border is very porous, how will this be managed? When there is fish stock in Uganda, most of the neighbouring boats will stray into our country and in some instances even the wind can blow the boats and nets across. How will this be dealt with? 

In addition to what my colleague, hon. Tim Lwanga, has said, fishermen actually pay a lot in terms of fuel. A litre of fuel is Shs 5000 –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Please ask the supplementary question.

MR OKEYOH: The supplementary question I am asking is: how will the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries help the fishing community out of this predicament?

3.09
THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL INDUSTRY AND FISHERIES (Mr Tress Buchanayandi): Rt hon. Speaker, question No. 1 is a question I also foresaw and sort consultation with the Ministry of Finance, but I am yet to get an answer. Therefore, I need time to consult them further and see why they objected. 

The other questions about annual licensing and offering number plates are issues that we are consulting on with stakeholders, and those are going to be included in the next Bill when it is discussed and tabled this current year. I thank you.

MR BADDA: Mr Speaker, the honourable minister has asked you for time to consult the Ministry of Finance as to why he refused to establish the fisheries fund. With your indulgence, can we request the minister to give the timeframe as to when he will come with that? 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Really, even before you go to timeframes, the fisheries fund is required by Article 153 (2) of the Constitution, Section 22 (a) of the Fisheries Act and another section in the public finance; why would Ministry of Finance refuse without assigning a reason? (Applause)

MR BUCYANAYANDI: I think that question would be answered by the Ministry of Finance because I made – (Interjections) - Yes, I wrote to finance and I quoted the reply –

MS ANYWAR: I thank you, Mr Speaker. When we request for information through oral questions, we expect the minister concerned, when comes on the Floor of Parliament, to be well equipped. Besides that, we expect these ministers to talk among themselves and coordinate on a number of issues. This, according to the minister, has been an outstanding issue which we think the minister should have talked to his colleague about in their meetings and harmonised the situation. 

Is the honourable minister in order to come on the Floor when we are asking what the position is, to again direct the Speaker to be the one to request for information from the Minister for Finance while he should have come and told us the predicament surrounding the issue having consulted his colleague? Is he in order?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think the honourable minister does not know where to find the Minister for Finance. (Laughter) So, I cannot rule on that subject. Please proceed.

MR BUCYANAYANDI: I thank you. As I indicated, I did consult and wrote and I received a reply from the Ministry of Finance. However, they said –(Interjections)- Yes, I am quoting the reply I received from the Ministry of Finance dated 30 November 2007 and signed by the Permanent Secretary objecting to the establishment of the fund –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Which year was it?

MR BUCYANAYANDI: 30 November 2011. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay.

MR BUCYANAYANDI: So up to now, I am waiting for an appropriate reply. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable minister, please answer the rest of the questions. But you should know that we have a question that is pending on why a ministry can refuse to implement a provision of a law. You should have done us the diligence to find out, but since you have not, we will be asking this question. Finish with the rest of the questions.

MR BUCYANAYANDI: If I had the powers to establish the fund, I would have used those powers but here – (Mr Tim Lwanga rose_)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let him proceed. Honourable minister, proceed and finish up. At the end of the meeting, consult hon. Lwanga because he has information on how you can get these things done. (Laughter) 

MR BUCYANAYANDI: I do appreciate but certainly, the establishment of this fund is in our interest and there is no way Ministry of Agriculture would have gone against its interest. There could have been budgetary constraints as to why this was not complied with, but it is an issue that I am going to continue following up. I ask for time to report back after further consultation.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: How much time do you need, honourable minister?

MR BUCYANAYANDI: Even up to tomorrow. I can even today disclose that I asked the Minister for Finance about the answer.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Wednesday next week.

MR BUCYANAYANDI: Can I report Tuesday next week?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Wednesday next week.

MR BUCYANAYANDI: Alright, Mr Speaker. I thank you.

QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER

QUESTION 24/1/09 TO THE MINISTER FOR SECURITY/AG. MINISTER FOR THE PRESIDENCY AND KAMPALA CITY COUNCIL

3.14
MR JOHN KEN-LUKYAMUZI: (CP, Rubaga Division South, Kampala): “(i) Would the Minister explain to this House why MPs representing the people of Kampala have never been consulted by Kampala City Council Authority in the latter’s quest to evict vendors from the streets and take over management of markets in the city?

(ii) What corrective measures is Government taking to stem and combat the inhuman and degrading treatment and economic disempowerment that KCCA is meting out on the vendors in Kampala?”

3.15
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR ECONOMIC MONITORING, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr Henry Banyenzaki): The question is 24/1/09 from hon. Ken-Lukyamuzi and the answer is as follows:

Rt. hon. Speaker and honourable members, we are all aware that management of markets and the maintenance of trade order in Kampala City is the responsibility of Kampala Capital City Authority. This responsibility was conferred upon the Authority by various laws enacted by this Parliament. 

Among others, Section 3 (a) of Part A of the Third Schedule of the Kampala Capital City Act, 2010 mandates the authority to prohibit, restrict, regulate or license the sale or hawking of wares, or the erection of stalls on any street, or the use of any part of the street or public place for the purpose of carrying on any trade, business or profession. The licensing and issuance of permits to street traders or hawkers and/or street vendors is provided for in the Local Government (KCC) Licensing of Trade Persons Ordinance, 2006 and Local Government (KCC) Maintenance of Law and Order Ordinance, 2006.

Up until the time of eviction, no vendor had obtained a valid permit or licence to ply their trade on the streets of Kampala City. Therefore, the street vendors were operating in the city illegally. This illegal practice had been stopped and it was stopped by Kampala Capital City Authority.

As for the markets, Mr Speaker and honourable members, it is common knowledge that most of the markets in the capital operate on land owned by Kampala Capital City Authority. Section 1 (1) of Part A of the Third Schedule of the Kampala Capital City Act, 2010 grants liberty to Kampala Capital City Authority to establish, acquire, erect, maintain, promote, assist or control markets with participation of citizens. The manner in which the markets are to be managed by the Authority is provided for in the Markets (Kampala Markets) Bye Laws, Statutory Instrument No. 94 (15) and the Local Government (Kampala City Council) Markets Ordinance, 2006. 

Under the above mentioned enactments, it is beyond any reasonable doubt that Kampala Capital City Authority has a statutory duty to manage all markets in Kampala. This duty therefore is part and parcel of the routine duties of the city authority.

In executing the management duty, Kampala Capital City Authority does so following the legal provisions in accordance with the law. Consultations of the MPs of Kampala will be done when it is applicable and feasible. It is not a bad idea.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I thank you. Do you have any supplementary question, hon. Ken- Lukyamuzi?

3.18
MR JOHN KEN-LUKYAMUZI (CP, Rubaga Division South, Kampala): I am surprised that the minister could answer in the way he has answered because he has admitted that Members of Parliament representing Kampala are not in the picture about what goes on when these acts which violate the Anti-Torture Act and violate Article 24 of the Constitution are put in practice. 

By stating that something is going to be done, the minister is accepting that there is something wrong on the ground. The Executive Director exercises powers she does not have. Under Article 142 of the Constitution, taxation is a responsibility of the Members of Parliament. It is therefore important that before any new taxation is brought on board in Kampala, not only the councilors should know of it but Members of Parliament should equally know of it.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: So what is the supplementary question?

MR KEN-LUKYAMUZI: The supplementary question is: Why doesn’t the Executive Director consult the members representing Kampala in Parliament about the new taxes that emerge from time to time? I have empirical evidence from Najjanankumbi where - 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, you already asked the supplementary question. Is there another supplementary question?

MR KEN-LUKYAMUZI: Yes, and it is: Are you aware that the Executive Director being referred to exercises the role of the Authority yet she is not supposed to act executively in terms of powers, because it is the Authority that has got the powers?

MR BANYENZAKI: Mr Speaker, the Executive Director is –(Interjections)– I have stipulated that very clearly that whatever she does, she does it in accordance with the law. 

Also, I would like to point out the fact that the Members of Parliament are ex-officio members of the council and so they have the liberty to, for example, attend the council meetings. In doing that, they could liaise with the Executive Director over such matters. 

Also, the door to the office of the Executive Director is open to anybody for consultations. I do not think hon. Ken-Lukyamuzi has ever gone to the office of the Executive Director and failed to talk to her. In that regard, Mr Speaker, I would like to appeal to honourable Members of Parliament that in case of such issues, always engage in dialogue with all those political leaders including His Lordship the Lord Mayor, so that the city can run smoothly.

CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE SECTORAL COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE AND INTERNAL AFFAIRS ON THE INQUIRY INTO THE PROCUREMENT OF EQUIPMENT FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION SYSTEM, THE NATIONAL ID PROJECT

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, you will recall that this report was presented yesterday by the chairman of the committee very elaborately and eloquently. The question was proposed upon which we took a decision that the debate takes place today. This is of course in view of the Rules of Procedure that require that upon presentation of reports of committees of this nature, ample time be given to members to internalise them before debating. The rules give three days, but yesterday we agreed that we proceed with debate today. I do not know whether the status has changed or not. So, let us see how to move on with this debate.

3.23
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker and honourable members. I rise to seek the indulgence of the Chair and members. Under our Rules of Procedure, rule 177, which I presume is what you quoted, it is stipulated that when a report has been laid on the Table, debate on such a report shall take place at least three days after. When you read that rule with rule 189, I believe, it clearly shows that on the part of the Executive - we received this report yesterday and it is a very serious report with very serious implications on very important matters of the State. Therefore, under these rules, we do believe that it is only fair that the Executive is given time to study that report, discuss it and take a position so that when we come to the debate in accordance with these rules, we have a position as an Executive.

We are debating maters that affect the State and these are very serious matters. I do not think it is really proper that we simply rush such matters. What does it cost us to wait for three days for us to prepare to give a considered opinion? What is the rush for?

In the circumstances, Mr Speaker, my request to colleagues, Members of Parliament, is for their understanding of the need for us to study this report to make a position as Government, rather than sitting here and simply listening or expecting us to debate individually. We have sworn to have collective responsibility and for us to do that, we need time. Thank you.

MR SEMUJJU NGANDA: Mr Speaker, we have had reports presented to this Parliament before. In fact, the presentations have concurrently been happening with the distribution, but after that we immediately begin debate. This is the first time I have seen the Rt hon. Prime Minister plead for more time before debate on a particular report. He says it is very important as if the other reports have not been important. 

I would like to think that the Executive, which has demonstrated some levels of disorganization here by picking policy statements from vehicles on the road and others are still - needs three days. The guidance I am seeking from you, Mr Speaker, is whether now we are going to adopt this as a practice, that for every report presented before Parliament debate will take place after three days – (Interjections) – I do not know why colleagues from the other side are jittery, but I am seeking guidance from you, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let me listen to hon. Majegere before we move on.

MR MAJEGERE: Mr Speaker, this report was presented to Parliament and as Members of Parliament we are the ones to debate. What we are saying is that we are ready to debate. In any case, the debate will be for the benefit of the Executive to take an informed decision after listening to the views that will prevail. The debate will give the Executive information upon which they can take an informed decision, a decision from an informed point of view. I thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: We are still looking at the issue raised by the Rt hon. Prime Minister and the views presented by hon. Ssemujju and hon. Majegere. Let us listen to hon. Wamai.

MR WAMAI-WAMANGA: Mr Speaker, yesterday you had wanted us to debate and one of the members requested that since it was a big report, and you rightly guided, we go, read this and come to debate today. The issue of the rules - that we wait for three days - does not arise because yesterday you said that we go and read the report then debate today, and members are ready to debate. I think it is in the interest of the Executive to listen to the views of the members of the House so that they go back and reflect on what has taken place in the House.

It seems now that whenever there is debate on the Floor of Parliament, the issues discussed must be taken to an upper house, which we do not know of, but the decisions must be taken on this Floor. Mr Speaker, we are ready to go ahead and have the debate on the report which was presented yesterday.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, rule 189 prohibits the distribution of committee reports to anybody until they are laid before the House. That was done yesterday. So, members, legally under the rules, should have received copies of the report yesterday. Rule 171 says that debate on reports so laid will take place at least three days from the date of the presentation of the report. However, yesterday, the situation from the House was different. A proposition was made that debate be deferred to today and that seemed to have been the consensus of the members. 

Of course, if we are to follow the rules strictly, we would have had to go under rule 14 to suspend the existing rules to allow us debate it as such. However, the agreement yesterday was that the matter be debated today, so if we are departing from that position then we need to prepare to depart from it.

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: Mr Speaker, first of all, I think that our rules must be strictly followed. I hope no one is suggesting that we should not follow our rules strictly. It is not possible that our rules are amended unless it is done in accordance with the rules. So if we were to amend the rules for instance by suspension of rule 177 and rule 189 for this purpose, then there must be a clear and explicit motion to that effect. It must be decided on by votes.

We are simply calling on colleagues who know that this report was not availed to us until yesterday, and surely you understand that a government has to take a common position. Yesterday when we received this report, we did not have time to study it. Today, we had a Cabinet meeting but we had a scheduled agenda and we have not had time to look through it. All I am asking of you, colleagues, is your understanding that we need to study this report and then take a position; what is the problem?  It appears to me to be a straightforward request. Surely, if we do not debate this thing today and we debate it in three days’ time, it is not going to cause mountains to move. What is the problem?

MS ALICE ALASO: Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Bible in some chapter I cannot remember says that the letter of the law kills but the spirit comes to save. I think if we are going to try to adhere to the law - the rule as provided - then we are going to find ourselves in a very difficult situation because over time, this is one of the rules where we have exercised so much discretion.

The Speaker has had the liberty to guide the House and there is such a huge precedent behind in not waiting for three days. If we say that today we want the strictest adherence to these rules, this House must prepare for the future; for every report that will ever come to this House, we will have to wait for three days. 

I am sure, Mr Speaker, for purposes of expedience the discretion the House has exercised for a long time on these rules has been very helpful in making Parliament do its work. I would like to urge the Prime Minister - I think he has stated his reason and it is not the rule. His reason is that he still wants to do something - consult with his team. I think the best he could do for us as they have done is to leave the rest of us to begin the debate and then he can consult his team and we wrap it up on Monday. He has a whole weekend to consult his team but let not the debate be stifled.

Some of us are ready for this debate, Mr Speaker, and if you will guide me and you want us to proceed, maybe I could move a motion to suspend particularly this rule so that we proceed.

MR BABA: Is the honourable member in order to say that they were ready to debate when she requested for more time to study the report and you granted it and we had to postpone the debate to today? Is she in order?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, these things that we say sometimes catch up with us. I think the motion was moved by the hon. Alaso yesterday that we defer the matter to today, and there were signs that people were ready to debate yesterday. 

If we are to go by precedents - and that is the discretion that I exercised yesterday - many reports have come and we waived the three-day rule to enable debate on matters that have no issues raised if the House has agreed to them. However, where there is contestation, then it becomes a different issue. Usually we move unanimously whether on suspending the rules or deferring the debates. However, in this case there is contestation; how do we handle it? If it was unanimous that we proceed to debate, then we would not have had any difficulty to deal with the precedence we have always used. 

MR KYAMADIDI: Thank you so much, Mr Speaker. I am at pains especially listening from the Rt hon. Prime Minister that-

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, you do not have to be at pains. The Rt hon. Prime Minister is just citing our rules. So, you do not have to be at any pains at all. The issue is that we have always exercised this discretion where there is no disagreement. We have always agreed that we can debate matters that are presented once members are ready to debate. But that is where there is no contestation. The rules are clear, so you do not have to be at pains. What we would like is to see how we can move forward, because the rules are clear and now there is a clear contestation on whether we should follow the rules strictly. I think that is where we are. Please, use your time. 

MR KYAMADIDI: Much obliged, Mr Speaker. Against that background, I beg to move that under rule 14, we suspend rule 177 and we proceed with the debate thereto.  

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It is seconded. Would you like to speak to your motion? 

MR KYAMADIDI: Thank you so much, Mr Speaker. Yesterday, I was actually very willing to debate and I think you even saw it, but I was only let down by my sister, hon. Alice Alaso. I do not think there is anywhere as Government where we have agreed - I am part of Government - that we should take a common position on this. (Applause) Whereas they can consult, I think this is not a matter of common position. The Executive can do their job but as the Legislature, under Article 79 we are bound to debate issues of national importance without necessarily taking a common position especially on an issue of this magnitude. 

Mr Speaker, you are aware, it is not very long ago that we even had a lot of money lost in a bicycle scam. We have now again lost money on IDs and you are yet to see some other institution of Government exonerate someone with 75 per cent shares and take on one with 25 per cent shares. I think we need to exercise the doctrine of separation of powers. This Parliament cannot be gagged by what the Executive wants. The Executive can do what they can do but this Parliament must stand up and be counted. I thank you. (Applause)

3.42
MS MONICAH AMODIMG (NRM, Youth Representative): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to agree with hon. Kyamadidi that the two organs of Government are quite distinct and they operate differently though they enrich each other. I think that they can proceed with or without the other although in consultation sometimes. Therefore, we are ready for this debate as a Legislature and we would like to proceed because this is a very important issue with a very big magnitude and impact on our country. We came here with a very ready appetite for this debate and so I would beg that we proceed with it. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the question is that we use rule 14 of our Rules of Procedure to suspend rule 177 (1) of our rules to enable us debate the issue presented to the House yesterday immediately.  

HON. MEMBERS:  Aye.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Just hold; I have not proposed the question, honourable members. I am now proposing the question as to whether we should suspend rule 177(1) of our Rules of Procedure or not; can I have debate on that? 

3.44
MR IBRAHIM SSEMUJJU NGANDA (FDC, Kyadondo County East, Wakiso):  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am very ready to debate the report on the ID Project. 

MR MWESIGE: Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of procedure. Rule 43 of our Rules of Procedure requires that all motions, except those motions moved under rule 44, should be moved with notice-(Interjections)- Yes, that is part of our rules. There is no motion which can be moved without notice, and the purpose of notice is to enable members prepare their minds to discuss the motion. If notice is to be dispensed with, leave of the Speaker must be obtained under rule 44. I seek your –(Interjection)- Rule 46 is there but I do not think this is one of the motions that falls under –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, address your mind to rule 46 (d).

MR MWESIGE: Okay, much obliged, Mr Speaker. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Proceed. 

MR SSUMUJJU NGANDA: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am looking at this as a test to this Parliament because this is not going to be the first time that we are having a debate on such a report. I do not know whether by practice now, we would want to move that we suspend this rule to have debate on reports; that is why I preferred the earlier arrangement. I fear for this institution because both options are very difficult - the option of the Prime Minister and the option of us suspending the rules. If we do suspend the rules, it means each time we would like to have a debate on a report, someone will move a motion that we suspend the rules. I do not know whether we can find a middle ground, Mr Speaker.  

Actually, for me the reason the Prime Minister gave should be a very strong reason that we must have this debate now because he says this is a very important report. Once it is a very important report that deals with us being Ugandans and being issued with proof, this becomes the very reason we should have this debate on the report. 

However, I will need to be helped with the practice we are introducing today, that each time we want to have a debate on a very important report, someone moves to suspend the rules and then debate later or someone stands up to say, “There is a rule that we must be aware of.” That is where I need help, Mr Speaker. I thank you very much. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, if this objection was raised yesterday, the Speaker would not even have put any matter to vote because that is the rule. However, because yesterday there was no issue about whether it should be debated yesterday or today, there was no issue of bringing the three days’ rule. We have used it before, but it was not debated then so the matter never came up. 

If it had come yesterday, it would not be an issue, but now it has come up and that is the difference. It has come up after we had agreed on a certain way we were going to move, like you have always done. Because it has come up, that is why this motion is being moved under rule 14 for suspension of rule 177(1) to allow, if it so allowed, the debate to take place. That is the matter we are debating now, so please do not get out of these four corners.

3.49
MR ALEX RUHUNDA (NRM, Fort Portal Municipality, Kabarole): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am really very concerned because for us, the parties concerned who are supposed to have this debate on this report and give information to the Executive for action, are not demanding for an immediate response. The Executive can take their time and they respond to what we have raised, but for this moment, an efficient Parliament, which is this Ninth Parliament, is saying that we were ready two days earlier and we are ready to do a good job for you such that you can run this country properly. I would really urge the members that let us go ahead and have the debate on this report such that the Executive can do a wonderful job for us.

3.50
THE MINISTER FOR KARAMOJA (Mrs Janet Museveni): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I just want to say that the members of the Executive are also Members of Parliament and they are members of the Ninth Parliament. I think it is not fair for this House to be pushed to have the debate on this report even before some of us have read the report because that is all we are trying to do. In the Rules of Procedure of this Parliament, we have three days-(Interruption)

MS AOL: Mr Speaker, the report we are talking of was presented in the House yesterday and all the Members of Parliament were supposed to be here. Even the hon. Prime Minister was represented. Is it in order for the honourable minister and First Lady to come up and say that they have not read the report because they were not there? Is it in order for her to be absent yesterday?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, you are forcing me to rule on the position of the Rules of Procedure. You see, what we are trying to do here is to find a way forward because if I am to rule on the position of the rules, you know what the answer is. That is what the hon. Aol is forcing me to do.

The honourable member for Ruhaama was making a point that she has not read the report and the rules give her three days to read it. That is the difficulty you are forcing me into, and I do not want to take that line. The issue is, there has been a matter which is in the House for us to debate and that issue is whether to suspend rule 177(1) or not. That is what we are debating and what the honourable member is contributing on.

MRS MUSEVENI: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I honestly want to say that it is unfair for my colleague to ask why I was not in Parliament yesterday-

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, that is not an issue.

MRS MUSEVENI: Well, I want to answer because she is saying the report was given out yesterday and I should have had it and read it because I am a Member of Parliament -(Interruption)

MS ANYWAR: Thank you. Mr Speaker, you have ably guided the House and taken a position on the issue at hand; is the honourable member and Minister for Karamoja in order to persist on the issue, which you have already ably guided this House on and put it to rest, instead of proceeding to debate the issue at hand? Is she in order?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, I did not rule on this matter. I said let us now discuss the matter that is before us. Honourable member, proceed with the debate on the motion.

MRS MUSEVENI: Alright. Mr Speaker, I think it is only fair that we allow the three days based on our Rules of Procedure, so that we may have the time to read this report and come back here and debate from an informed point of view. That is all we are trying to say. We all agree that these issues must be debated but we are entitled to those three days because it is in our Rules of Procedure. Why should that rule be suspended because some people have all the time to read the report? Some of us have to be in Karamoja and if we have to come back, we must allow the Rules of Procedure to apply to all of us. Thank you, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Kiyingi, you said you had a point of procedure.

3.57
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR REGIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Asuman Kiyingi): Thank you, Mr Speaker. My point is not strictly a procedural matter. I just want to make a contribution on the merits of proceeding with the debate in the way we are doing. My very good friend, hon. Semujju Nganda - I usually do not agree with him but for the first time he has talked a lot of sense, in my estimation -(Interruption)

MR SEMUJJU NGANDA: Mr Speaker, I fairly know hon. Kiyingi. He has run to me several times when he is in problems especially when I was still practising journalism. I did not know whether his view then was that I do not make sense. Is the hon. Minister Kiyingi in order to suggest that someone legally elected to this Parliament and a shadow minister –(Laughter)- is only sensible today and that all the time he has not been sensible?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The point on which I am being asked to rule is the statement that the hon. Kiyingi made regarding the sense and sensibilities of the hon. Semujju Nganda. As to whether he is sensible or not, I cannot rule on that but as to whether the use of the word “senseless” is parliamentary, it is not parliamentary. So to that extent, you are not in order.

MR ASUMAN KIYINGI: I withdraw, Mr Speaker. The point I was labouring to make is that we have a situation where a report was presented yesterday and some members have had opportunity to read it while others have not. As a matter of fact, I am not even privileged to have read it. I do not have a copy. I have not received a copy yet and I am a legislator representing the people of Bugabula South. They need to hear my views on this matter. The rules duly protect me; they entitle me to adequate notice and adequate preparation so that I speak sense. Now, you want to violate my right to prepare and make a reasonable presentation to the House by suspending the rules and stampeding me into a debate I am not prepared for. 

I am just making a humble request to colleagues. There is nothing that is going to change. The report is written and it has even been published, even on the net I am told. What is the harm? What irreparable damage is going to be suffered by the people who are insisting that we must do it now if we give adequate notice to everybody to come and debate properly? Why do you have to project the image of a kangaroo court, that you are stampeding people, you want to subject them to trial and execute them immediately? Why? I think we should protect the image of this House by proceeding and observing our own rules. I thank you.

4.01
MS CERINAH NEBANDA (NRM, Woman Representative, Butaleja): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Yesterday I was in this House; this is not the first debate we are having on a report. We have had reports in this House and we have debated even when other members were not around. Yesterday, I was here and I received this report. The whole night - in fact my husband complained - (Laughter). This is a serious matter. 

Mr Speaker, when we were here, hon. Alaso moved a motion. The Prime Minister was not around but he left a representative- 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, for purposes of the future readers of the Hansard, you need to be clear about why your husband complained. (Laughter)

MS NEBANDA: Mr Speaker, I am raising my point. (Laughter) The person who was representing the Leader of Government Business did not bring up this issue. So, last night I started reading this report and even today I stayed up reading this report and I came here well equipped to debate. 

Now, I am wondering, which kind of interest does the Executive have in this report so that we have to postpone debate for three days? You have to be open and tell us whether you have a candidate or whether there is one who is implicated here of special interest, so that we know, because we have been having debates on these reports without postponing.

I have come here well prepared and I am here to debate. We are not going to say that all members have to be here every day. That means we shall not handle business in the House. We shall be waiting for all members to come. So, I am well equipped with all the gas and the energy in order to debate this today. Thank you very much.

4.04
MR EDDIE KWIZERA (NRM, Bufumbira County East, Kisoro): Mr Speaker, thank you very much. I know Government was present yesterday and they never raised this. So, if they did not raise it yesterday, they cannot raise it now.

Secondly, I am not a member of the Business Committee but it is on the Order Paper, item No.7. Who put it there if they knew it was contradicting the Rules of Procedure?

Another point is that by not debating this business, it means we are increasing the backlog of Parliament. We should avoid having a backlog of Parliament business. Our performance is measured on the output. So you are now blocking our output.

Lastly, the debate is not ending today. We shall not conclude the debate today. We are going to give the Executive time to make sure that they make their input, so I do not see any reason why we cannot suspend the rule and we debate. Thank you very much.

MS SANTA ALUM (UPC, Woman Representative, Oyam): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Yesterday other members were ready. I was ready to debate this matter yesterday but others were not, so we all agreed that the House defer this debate to today. I believe most of the Members of Parliament are ready except the Executive. I would like to ask this question: Is this report for the Executive or for Parliament? 

Two, Mr Speaker, I would like to know if really at an appropriate moment, we cannot come up with an issue of the Executive also being Members of Parliament. As you can see now, the Executive has one leg in Parliament and another leg in the Executive. That is why we are meeting this problem as Members of Parliament. So, we have to come up at an appropriate time to make sure that we separate the powers - constitutional mandate - so that Parliament remains with its legislative role and the Executive remains with their role. I thank you, Mr Speaker. 

4.06
MR KENNETH LUBOGO (Independent, Bulamogi County, Kaliro): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I rise to support the proposal that we go ahead and suspend the rule and debate. If there is one area where the public has confidence in this House, it is in the area of fighting corruption. That is well known. This report has been published in the media and it talks about corruption. I believe that in everything that we do, our rules say, and I want to read from our Rules of Procedure, Appendix F (5): “Members shall at all times conduct themselves in a manner which will maintain and strengthen the public’s trust and confidence in the integrity of Parliament and never undertake any action which may bring the House or its Members generally, into disrepute.”

I believe that what we are doing here has a lot of bearing on the public out there. For that reason, the public is looking at us to see what we are going to do with this report. It will be a great disappointment if we say that we have postponed this debate especially since we have not been postponing debate before. 

I believe that the interest of the Executive is subordinate to the interest of the public and for that reason I support the idea that we go ahead and debate. The Executive shall prepare itself to answer and give clarifications on areas where we have debated. (Applause) I thank you, Mr Speaker. 

4.08
MS BETTY AOL (FDC, Woman Representative, Gulu): Mr Speaker, we can see the mood. Members are in the mood of debating and postponing means killing this debate. We can see that the Executive are after getting a strategy. They want to caucus to strategize in killing issues of corruption, which is very glaring in the report. The reason for postponing or for asking for the rules to stand is because there are issues of corruption in this report. Stop caucusing to protect corrupt people. The Executive has never asked for three days till today. 

Also, not all of us will have opportunity to debate; why don’t we just give the opportunity for those who are ready and have prepared themselves to start the debate? Let us not kill this debate. I would like to move a motion that you put this to question so that-

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, in the assessment of the Speaker, it will not be the right time to take this vote. We will permit more debate.

4.10
MR JACOB OBOTH (Independent, West Budama County South, Tororo): Thank you, Mr Speaker-(Interruption)

MR SEBAGGALA: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In the interest of time and given the fact that this is a very important report and that we have a lot to handle as Parliament, the guidance I am seeking from you is that since many are in agreement that we continue with the debate, isn’t it prudent that we start debating right now? Shouldn’t we start debating instead of wasting more time because we are in agreement that we must begin debating right now?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, the issues that are raised and the issues that are under debate are squarely within the Rules of Procedure of this House. That is why we are debating them. It could not in any strain of interpretation be taken to mean wasting time. Otherwise, we run the risk of now starting to operate without rules. 

A motion has been proposed and a question proposed for debate, and the debate is going on. The honourable member has asked the Speaker that the question be put. It is within the rules for the Speaker to exercise discretion whether the Speaker is satisfied that the debate can safely be concluded. That discretion is given to the Speaker by the Rules of Procedure. I have exercised that discretion the way I have. We have not wasted time and we are not wasting time.

MR OBOTH: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I stand the risk of taking you aback within the same rules. I am rising on a point to seek further guidance on what the effect of rule 14 would be. The two scenarios are: one, an objection or a request to stay the debate for the three days under rule 177, and then the motion under rule 14. Both are coming after the decision of this House that was made yesterday. I know this is within your discretion, but what would be the effect of the decision today first vis-à-vis the decision made yesterday? Also, when does rule 14 apply; when the report is just laid or any time before debate on the report rule 14 could apply to suspend the rules? 

If we can be able to harmonise this, I think it would help us, but this is one area that I stand the risk to be a derailer and really, the two rules are competing for the attention of the Speaker. May you further guide as to when rule 14 applies? Would it have applied yesterday? Would rule 14 still be applicable today? The same question then goes for rule 177; would it still be applicable today?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, it is only rules 4, 5, 10, 11, 12(1) and 83 that cannot be suspended under rule 14. The rest of the rules, for as long as they stand on the way of a particular procedure that the House is interested in executing, can be suspended at any time such a matter arises. 

Now, how has this matter arisen? Rule 177(1) was not an issue yesterday. It has been the practice of the House where there is no controversy on a particular report that has been presented and there is no objection, the House normally has proceeded to debate on it without any problem. Like I said, if it was raised yesterday, there would have been even no issue about voting on it but the agreement yesterday was that we proceed. However, before we commence debate today, the matter has been raised and in the course of debating and discussing the matter, a motion has been moved for suspension of rule 177(1) in essence to take us back to yesterday’s position. That is what it is saying. 

So, should we go by yesterday or should we take the actual proposition of the rules? That is what we are debating, and I am saying the Chair is not satisfied with the extent of the debate we have engaged in now. So, I do not want to put the matter to vote even if you moved a motion. I will still decline that we put the question. I will not put the question. Let us exhaustively discuss this matter.

4.17
MR JOHN KEN-LUKYAMUZI (CP, Rubaga Division South, Kampala): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I have been in this House for some time. Yesterday, it is in black and white that hon. Alaso moved a motion on the same subject. We briefly debated it and finally pronounced ourselves on the same motion. In terms of parliamentary procedure which cannot be contested, would it not be a precedent for us to pronounce ourselves again in a similar debate, and what sort of precedent are we creating for this Parliament?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Ken-Lukyamuzi, I happen to have been in the Chair here and I did not put the question, if you remember correctly. I asked members, “Is it necessary to take a vote on this issue?” and they said “No, there is no point.” So the matter was never put to vote, please. The records are clear on this. But I never put the question, so that those in favour say, “Aye” to the contrary, “No”. That is how you vote. I said, “Should I put this matter to vote?” You said, “No, no,” because there was agreement. So, please, let us deal with this matter which is before us. Stop derailing us. Now, hon. Karuhanga, what guidance again after I have just guided? 

MR KARUHANGA: Mr Speaker, I beg to get further guidance from you. I do not know whether we have the Hansard with us; but if you may recall properly, I recall very well, I was seated here. You actually put the question -(Interjections)- yes, you did, Mr Speaker. You did, Mr Speaker, and those for aye took the day. I am very sure the Hansard is very clear. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, no.

HON. MEMBERS: Yes!

MR KARUHANGA: Mr Speaker, yes. Mr Speaker, we can refer to the Hansard and it will clarify this matter very well. Thank you. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: You see, honourable members -(Interjections)- even if it were true that I put the question -(Laughter)- no, no. Even if it were true, which it is not - because you see, to put the question, I need to say, “honourable members, I put the question. Will those in favour say “Aye” and to the contrary “No.” I did not do that yesterday. [Hon. Members: “You did.”] I did not. [Hon. Members: “You did.”] No, I asked, “Should I really put this matter to vote?” Then the Members said, “No. It is okay.” 

But that notwithstanding, a substantive issue has arisen today, bringing the issue – honourable members - I said, even if I did - a substantive matter has arisen today, that we need to follow the rules. This is a substantive matter which came today. Because of the presence of Rule 177(1), a motion has been moved to formally suspend Rule 177(1). That is what we are debating. So, whether there was a question put yesterday or not, it is immaterial today. Okay? 

Honourable members, if there are no more issues for discussion on these matters, we conclude this debate. (Interjections) [Mr Niwagaba: “Motion.”] [Mr Magyezi: “After me; after my presentation.”] 

4.22
MR WILFRED NIWAGABA (NRM, Ndorwa County East, Kabale): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise to move a motion under Rule 68 that debate on this particular matter be closed and a question be put. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, I had just ruled on this matter. I stated it about three times. According to Rule 68(1), “After a question has been proposed in the House or in Committee and debated, a Member may move ‘That the question be now put...’ which motion he is moving again. “...And, unless it appears to the Speaker that the motion is an abuse of the rules of the House or an infringement of the rights of any Member, the question, ‘That the question be now put’ shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate.” 

So, it is in the opinion of the Speaker -(Interjections)- that if we block debate now, it will infringe on Members’ rights to debate on this issue. That is the opinion of the Speaker, which I have exercised with great discretion, judiciously. So, please – hon. Magyezi.

4.24
MR RAPHAEL MAGYEZI (NRM, Igara County West, Bushenyi): Mr Speaker, I rise to support the motion -(Interjections)- that we should suspend the rules; Rule 177, and proceed to debate the report with the following reasons. I have heard the argument that we need to stick to our rules and observe them. I want to emphasise that by suspending the rules, we are simply observing our Rules of Procedure. We are not moving away from our rules.

Secondly, I hear that argument as well, from especially honourable ministers, that some Members were not here yesterday. They want to be given time to read the report, blah, blah. This is important and I duly respect the offices and responsibilities of those colleagues. However, the argument that we suspend debate simply because an individual has not read the report does not hold. This is because we cannot suspend institutional responsibility on the basis of the failure of a Member to read a report. It would, otherwise, mean that those Members who were not here today will argue that we do not debate the report until they have read it. This should not arise, especially given the fact that yesterday, we had quorum. 

We sat and listened for quite some time to the chairperson of the committee. He took us through the report. I think it is important to respect those honourable members who are fully attending these sessions. We have read and done our part. (Applause) I think we should move on.

Thirdly, it is my view that proceeding to debate this report is in the interest of the Executive because we all believe that the NRM Government stands to fight corruption and they are ready at even the shortest notice, to show their defence against corruption. (Applause) To postpone this debate portrays the Executive a little bit negatively in the eyes of the public. 

Finally, I think it is important for us to redeem our image as a Parliament. We do not sit here because of ourselves; we sit here because of those who sent us here. Ugandans are out there waiting. They have been listening; they are watching even now. They are waiting; they want to hear what this Parliament is saying. I think it is important that we proceed to execute our responsibility. Thank you, Mr Speaker.

4.27
DR CHRIS BARYOMUNSI (NRM, Kinkiizi County East, Kanungu): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Very soon, you may ask us to start considering the policy statements and there will be little time for plenary sessions in the short-run. Let me hope that the Prime Minister is not reading into that to buy time and kill this report. (Interjections) Yes. Let me hope that you are not working towards avoiding a debate on this report. (Interjections)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The honourable member shall be heard in silence. (Laughter)

DR BARYOMUNSI: You know, Mr Speaker, I speak for the Prime Minister as well since I am from Kanungu. (Laughter) I was just making a point that when you look at our calendar, we have a debate on the State-of-the-Nation Address, but also, soon, we shall be going into committees to consider the policy statements. I was saying that let me hope the Prime Minister is not using that opportunity for us to go into that period so that this report is strangled. We shall not allow.

Now that some Members of the front bench are saying they have not read the report, I think we are not saying that we are going to conclude and take a decision today, because from the look of things, most of the Members are ready to debate. I think the middle ground should be that those who are ready to debate start debating. This report is only 40 pages. Even the time we have spent on these procedural matters, was enough for them to finish reading it, then we can give them time tonight so that we do not conclude the debate today; tomorrow they can respond or make their submissions. 

Mr Speaker, the reason I belong to NRM is that NRM is committed to fighting corruption. (Applause) I do not want the public to think that we are scared of debating a report which is about corruption and theft. So, I urge the Frontbench to concede for the report to be debated. Those who have not read it, you will have time tonight and by tomorrow, you will be ready so that the debate is concluded tomorrow or the day after. Otherwise, Parliament might be misunderstood by the public if we do not start debating this report. 

But also, suspending a rule is part of our rules. So, the question of saying observing three days means suspending the rules is also part of our rules. Since most of us are ready, there is no reason why we should even spend a lot of time on procedural matters, and especially if the matter could be decided through a vote, so that the substantive debate commences on this reports. 

4.30
MR MICHAEL MUKULA (NRM, Soroti Municipality, Soroti): Mr Speaker and honourable colleagues, we have spent close to three hours going around an issue which, in my own view, would have been a simple matter. I have been in this Parliament since 1996 –(Interjections)– and in my position as a highly ranked Member, I would like to say that Parliament and this committee in its own right, has carried out, very effectively, its oversight function of checking the Executive. 

This report was presented yesterday and I am very sure that every time we sit in this House, we spend a lot of money. I am of the view that we save the country from wastage of resources and get down to business. I would like to suggest and persuade my colleague and brother, the Leader of Government Business, to concede and allow this debate ensue so that colleagues here who have now -by consensus, you can see that there is a huge appetite to have this debate take place. Therefore, I would like to urge and persuade colleagues in the Executive, and through you Mr Speaker, that in the interest of the NRM, this is a very important document and we are fulfilling a major point in our manifesto as NRM in fighting corruption in this country. 

Therefore, I would like to say, Rt Hon. Speaker, that you be persuaded - and honourable colleagues, take a position - to the effect that you rule that we go ahead and debate this report and let the people of Uganda get to know what went wrong in this country. Therefore, this matter, if possible –(Interruption)

4.33
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Mr Speaker and honourable colleagues, since I had hoped that hon. Baryomunsi, being my representative, would support my position –(Laughter)– and since he has clearly not, which is something I will sort out with him at home; and since it is obvious that there is overwhelming desire to debate this report now –(Applause)– on behalf of the Government of NRM, which is a Government that hears the voice of the people –(Applause)– and since I am hearing hon. Odo speaking for the first time out of the Rules –(Laughter)– Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Executive, who had raised this motion, I wish to withdraw that objection. But certainly, what we are saying is accurate, that most of us have not read the report. However, I hope we shall go and read the report and contribute before the debate closes. Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much, Rt Hon. Prime Minister. Hon. Mukula was calling upon the Speaker to rule on a motion. I wonder what rule he was going to recite to enable the Speaker rule on a motion that is being debated on the Floor of Parliament. That would have been impossible.

Honourable members, the motion is to debate the report of the committee. (Interjections) Is it still necessary to suspend the rules? (Interjections) Should we proceed to suspend the rules again? I think we have enough precedent not to suspend rules to debate. That is what we relied on yesterday and I am sure that is what has guided the Rt Hon. Prime Minister, so that we can have a way forward. Because situations will keep coming when reports come and they are urgent and they may not have three days to wait. So, it might be difficult for us to keep suspending all the time. So, can we go back to the position of yesterday that debate on this report starts today? –(Interjections)– So, it starts today. And that is not a vote by the way. By your saying “Aye” does not mean you have voted according to the rules. That is what happened yesterday; you said “Aye”, and thought that was supposed to be a vote. 

So, I am not going to put the question; I am going to open debate. We agreed yesterday, that each Member will take three minutes.

MS NAMARA: Mr Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the Prime Minister for conceding and accepting us to debate this report. There was a motion on the Floor, which has not been disposed of. So, I wonder how we are going to start a debate before we dispose of the motion. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, I thought that is what I was speaking about and I finished with it. I said, there was this motion, but now, there is no objection at all. Did I have to put the question to it again? And Members said, no, no, let us proceed and we treat it as something – maybe, we should conclude it formally for the avoidance of doubt. My problem is, if I take a vote on this motion of suspending the rules, it would be upsetting the precedent we have already been using in the past; that if a report is urgent and the House is in agreement, we proceed to debate it without having to suspend the rules. That is what I was trying to avoid, so that we keep that precedent there. And if we come forward and the report has been presented and there is unanimity from the Members that we proceed and debate it, we do not have to wait for three days, because we may not even have the three days, anyway, and we do not have to suspend the rules every time we have to do this. That was the agreement, hon. Namara. (Mr Vincent Mujuni rose_) On what point do you rise?

MR MUJUNI: Guidance. (Laughter)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay.

MR MUJUNI: Mr Speaker, there was a motion already accepted by this House. It is on record that there was a contest. I want to applaud the Prime Minister for giving in. But, Mr Speaker, you are already aware that there is Rule 171(1) that requires that the report be –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: 177.

MR MUJUNI: 177(1), - the report be laid before the House and debated after three days. Now, because of the contest, we had moved that we suspend the rule and allow debate and the motion had already been accepted and debated on. I need to be guided whether to dispose it would mean to withdraw this motion or that the House takes a position on this. I beg to be guided.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: You can withdraw the motion if it was your motion.
 
MR MUJUNI: I thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In the interest of Uganda –(Laughter)- and in the interest of my good party NRM, of my Prime Minister and Leader of Government Business, and in the interest of our mood to fight corruption given that we have even accepted to debate this report today, I beg to withdraw the motion.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The motion is withdrawn. Debate on the substantive issue before the House on the report of the Committee of this House on this matter of the national ID question is proposed for debate. The debate starts now.  (Members rose_) I will pick those who have not been speaking.

4.42
DR MEDARD BITEKYEREZO (NRM, Mbarara Municipality, Mbarara): I thank you very much, hon. Speaker -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: You have three minutes, remember.

DR BITEKYEREZO: I thank hon. Mulongo and his colleagues on the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs for a job well done.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, members of the committee will not debate this report.

DR BITEKYEREZO: Mr Speaker, I am very glad that you have given me chance to speak first on this item because I have been yearning to talk about this issue of IDs – Identity Cards. It is very unfortunate for this Parliament to witness a Ugandan stealing money meant for IDs for this country.

Yesterday, I was very astonished to witness - reading page 17 of this report, when they said that hon. Alintuma Nsambu included on his delegation two non-officials who were assigned false titles to his comfort. That “killed” me. This was a Minister for ICT and he opted to take some people for his own comfort to Germany and the man is there and I do not know what he is doing right now. (Laughter) 

I have a conviction that this person should be in the courts of law and the NRM is committed to fighting corruption and you know it – up to the bone marrow - and that is why some of us joined it because we read the manifesto very well. I would urge the Government of Uganda to apprehend this man and put him in the courts of law and the man brings back the money that was misappropriated.

I am telling you, for me, as Dr Bitekyerezo representing Mbarara Municipality, I will not support anybody in NRM, my own party, who misappropriates Government money including even hon. Adolf Mwesige, who is my closest friend. (Laughter) I have even been telling him here that it is very difficult for me. Even the Rt Hon. Prime Minister cannot misappropriate money and I support him. He is my uncle, but I cannot do that. So, that is why I am basing myself on this report that any minister of Uganda that bothers to do this - this is a very dangerous message to all of you on the front bench that I want to go in the Hansard that I will not support any minister in the Government of Uganda to misappropriate Government money here. Even if we caucus, we have nothing to change. There is a problem here because this is a finding of the Committee on Defence and it was carried out by people from both NRM and the Opposition, which is the Parliament of Uganda.

I want to urge my fellow Members of Parliament of Uganda to join me in urging Government to apprehend the people that misappropriated the money that was meant for the national ID and I am not ready to pay money. (Member timed out.)

4.45
MR AMOS OKOT (NRM, Agago County, Agago): I thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the committee for the report that they gave us yesterday. I went through this report and I was interested in Annex No. 5 because given what they have written, I agree with most of the issues that they have raised. 

When you read Annex No.5 and when you again compare with the report, it appears that the Ministry of Finance has not been touched. When I read Annex No.5 of this report, bullet no.3, if you allow me, I can quote some small portion there. The Permanent Secretary wrote it clearly that the honourable Minister for Finance requested the Minister for Internal Affairs to start on the procurement process. 

Bullet No.5 clearly stated that - and I can also read if it is allowed, “As mentioned in 1 (b), issues of potential service providers’ track record, results of the diligence tests, advantages of using contracting the particular providers, are taken care of - the Ministry of Finance and all the stakeholders are fully involved in this process.” This tells us that the Ministry of Finance was fully involved in this process, but the recommendation in this report did not touch them. 

My position is this -[Hon. Nebanda: “Mention the names.”]- the Ministry of Finance should be found responsible. It is very outright that when they were reading the Budget for this financial year, they still went ahead to include that I, Amos and the rest of Ugandans should pay for the national ID which I consider not to be fair. They should consider withdrawing that statement they made in the Budget Speech.

When I consider how we have been debating on many sagas that have been taking place in this country, the institution of Parliament is still being regarded as an honest institution in this country. This tells us that in many situations, when the issue of corruption comes up and yet we know that NRM, of which I am a member, stands for nationalism and protection of the rights of the people - though, some people sometimes misinterpret the President’s letter and use it for their own interests and then in the end, this creates trouble in the country. 

Parliament should come out clearly with the law so that the power lost by citizens of this country – we know that Government has the Executive and the Judiciary, but if Parliament presents issues to them and they are not addressed to its expectations,
 Parliament could, at an appropriate time, amend the laws so that issues of that nature can be well addressed. 

I believe that we have the mandate, as the people’s representatives, to do that because all we are doing is to ensure that the citizens of this country receive the services they are entitled to.

4.44
MR WILBERFORCE YAGUMA (NRM, Kashari County, Mbarara): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the committee for presenting this very good report. This report is not very different from the report on the KCCA/Market saga – the Haba Group of Companies. Ugandans lost many billions in that saga and even in this report, we read that Ugandans have lost a lot of money.

Mr Speaker, our three officers have stooped so low that they were even facilitated by the contracting companies. Imagine someone travelling at the expense of the company. Even the engineers were facilitated by the company. What do you expect?

I would like to propose that all those implicated should be made to refund the money. Ugandans have seen enough, and these billions should be refunded, and I can assure this House that the equipment will not help Ugandans. That we should pour in more money to make the equipment work,  will be  incurring more losses for Ugandans. Let us halt the project and whatever money has been spent be refunded for the good of Ugandans. I thank you very much.

4.50
MS ALUM SANTA (UPC, Woman Representative, Oyam): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to draw the attention of the House to Appendix 13 that talks about the Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Electoral Commission. 

When you read page 2, it is reported that the Commission was not able to utilise the procurement funds for the biometric voters’ registration system. I do not know whether the committee took the trouble to interact with the Electoral Commission on this matter in detail, because it is common knowledge that it was the Electoral Commission that had the consent, budget, programme, plan and activities and also the capacity to implement this project. It is also on record that during mobilisation the staff of the Electoral Commission actively participated in this project. 

But when you read page 14, you realise that in the middle of the programme, the Electoral Commission was thrown out of the project. Why? When you go to page 13, you will get the answer to that; it’s because it was the only institution of Government which - it. On page 13, observation (c), the former minister disguised himself as - in his own words - “the prime mover of things” and reported that whenever there was a barrier, there was need for the top administrator to have it removed. This is a very serious statement coming from the minister concerned. Actually, the barrier he is referring to is the one that made the Electoral Commission which was responsible for this project to give way, and later on it was the same Electoral Commission brought in to implement the project. How could the Ministry of Internal Affairs come in somewhere in the middle to just procure the equipment when the implementer was different? I am wondering how the Ministry of Internal Affairs went on to implement a project they had not conceptualised.

Mr Speaker, on page 39, the report says that the Ministry of Internal Affairs is the mother ministry, yet, when you read the Appendix, you realise that the people who went there as the technical team does not include the Ministry of Internal Affairs – the mother ministry as being involved or participating. As a mother, I have never seen a mother who remains absent-minded when something is happening to her child. So, I am wondering –(Member timed out.)

4.54
MR JOHNY SSASAGA (FDC, Budadiri County East, Sironko): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have two issues to raise. One of them is about the list of the committee members who signed the report. I notice that the name of hon. Mike Mukula has a big star against it. I had thought the star was about the spelling, but that seems to be okay. So, I have failed to understand what the star means. I am trying to suspect that either his signature was forged or somebody doubted his party as being NRM.

The second one is about the committee itself. In my view, the committee may have tried, as much as possible, to protect the President. I am saying this because several instances clearly show that the President could have violated the PPDA regulations. On all these appendices and annexes, the President wrote in person. When you go to page 35 - (h), the President was directing that the information about the contract be treated as classified. Why is it classified?

He moved on to advise the minister that the contract be carried out as single-source procurement. We got a chance of interfacing with the Minister of Finance in a retreat together with the PPDA. The PPDA insisted that they kept on advising the President against single-sourcing because it would cause trouble,, because a contractor would be hand-picked, and they may do substandard work. And it was a big loophole on how the money was to be stolen.

Therefore, I believe that the committee could have gone ahead to even make the President responsible, because quite often, the President wants to use members of the front bench as his rubber stamp to achieve what he wants, but after sometime, he sacrifices them. I am saying so because of the advice that the President had got from the PPDA, which was in charge of regulating the contract.

I want to conclude by saying that Members of the frontbench, you can stand here and always support the President and sometimes own the mess, but that damages your reputation. I am of the view that always let the President come and face it. If he has directed you in a wrong way and you believe it is wrong, always stand by your word. Otherwise, we shall always ask you to pay back the money yet the President who is the Chief Executive of this country is always protected. For how long will that continue? You remember when Temangalo came up with other issues, but the name of the President surfacing –(Member timed out.)

4.57
MS JESCA ABABIKU (Independent, Woman Representative, Adjumani): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to also thank the committee for presenting this report. On page 19, recommendations are given, based on the content, specifically on the financial challenges and the corruption, as a result of the way monies were abused. In that regard, I would like to know the sources that we shall use to get the funds to implement these recommendations.

Two, on page 32, there is some recommendation to clear the former Minister of Finance among the stakeholders who possibly misled and mismanaged this project. The justification given is that the role of the former Minister of Finance was only to mobilise funds and disburse. But I strongly believe that beyond mobilisation and disbursement of funds, the ministry has got responsibility to see to it that monies mobilised and disbursed, should be properly used. So, I am not totally convinced and I believe it is a way of discriminating, maybe, picking on some stakeholders who may have mismanaged these funds.

There is an indication that the equipment, which was shipped was not checked properly. Therefore, the issue of the quality of the equipment is not answered. As they recommend that this project should be continued with, what are we saying about the equipment? 

More so, the chair did say that now the way the equipments are kept, there is no total responsibility. So, what is our take on the equipment?

I also have a concern about these monies because it has been indicated that these were borrowed monies. It shows that we have financial constraints and again we are abusing what we borrow. That is the pain that I have.

Lastly, often, we are being told that when the President advises and directs, people normally take their own stand. (Member timed out.)

MR BENJAMIN CADET (Independent, Bunyaruguru County, Rubirizi): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity. I want to thank the committee for the wonderful report they made. When you read this report, you find that when they contacted our beloved security agency of ESO, it gave them a clear report that this company you are talking about, gets tenders or contracts by manipulating friends in the political circles, as well as the military and it is good at bribing people. It had also been involved in criminal activities in other countries. Now, we ask ourselves how such a company got a contract even without bidding and after the minister had been briefed that this was a ‘negative’ company. It did not bid, it was not interested, but from the report, it is clear that some officials just went there because of the big monies involved and gave this company a tender basically to benefit from it. I do not know if it was a deliberate effort by our beloved Government. We have had scenarios where we failed because we did not have the IGG for more than two years. When ‘big’ officials were taken to court because of corruption, they started challenging the legality of the office of the IGG, which is not properly constituted. 

In this report, you can also see that the same thing is happening. We do not have a Solicitor General who is supposed to advise the Attorney-General and even Government, in terms of contracts. For two years he has not been appointed. Is this by mistake or it is deliberate? Those are the loopholes that our colleagues are utilising to swindle resources from the country.

To know that this was a scheme that was designed, stakeholders like UBOS, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of ICT were not invited for the State House meeting except for one individual, who assigned himself, and called Nabongo, a worker of UBOS; and he was not even sent by the director of UBOS. He went to the meeting and then they said that it was fine.

I feel those are not right and should be condemned. Because of time, all the officials that were implicated it is unfortunate that most of them have left Government - hon. Kivejinja and hon. Alintuma - as they are out of Government. I want to urge Parliament that the thieving has become too much. (Member timed out.)

5.05
MS JACKLINE AMONGIN (NRM, Woman Representative, Ngora): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I want to commend the work of this committee for coming up with such a report. What I want our emphasis to be - it should not be business as usual. First of all, the committee has come up with recommendations. To me, they are very key recommendations and I would still want to see a report later whether these recommendations were implemented, because fighting corruption in Uganda today - I imagine that most of the Members in this House and those who were here prior have been named in this report.

Hon. Kivejjinja was a senior member and a legislator in this House; hon. Alintuma Nsambu, who is actually struggling to come back to this House - and even other members whom I am not going to mention here.

I think this is too much, when it comes to the issue of corruption in this country, we are not going to support anybody and let this be on record. The honourable ministers, the Executive who sign papers in the various ministries -[Hon. Members: “Where are they?”]- should be in position to carefully look at what they sign before a cliques take advantage;  because as far as I am concerned the President was doing this in good faith, but different stakeholders have taken advantage of the recommendations of the President to fulfill their personal interest rather than fulfilling the interest of the people of Uganda. 

As I speak now, I came from Ngora a few days back. We still do not have health centres and schools in some sub-counties because we have policies. But now, the money which is supposed to do a particular activity and especially the national IDs is being diverted. It is very shameful for a senior minister to go abroad on Government money with the secretaries. (Member timed out.)

MS NEBANDA: Thank very much, Mr Speaker. The matter that we are discussing is a very important issue that pertains to this nation and taxpayers’ money, but as I look on the front bench, I do not see the Leader of Government Business, and we were not informed on who he has left in charge. Therefore, sincerely, I want to know whether it is right for us to proceed without the Leader of Government Business noting down the issues of Members.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, this matter is from a committee of this House and this House is debating.

5.09
MR PATRICK NAKABALE (NRM, Youth Representative, Central): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. First, I would like to appreciate the committee for the good work done and also observe as follows; this matter of the National IDs is a matter of a national asset. Issues concerning the national IDs are national matters that deserve the attention of everybody. This is because when it comes to planning, we need them; when we go for effective communication and monitoring, we need them. We need our country to develop, and today, if we are to develop, we need to reduce the AK 47s on the streets, for example. 

How are we going to achieve this? It is by the people of Uganda easily being identified using the National IDs. In the interest of all this, the matter should not be of a hide and seek nature. It should rather be of national concern and this is how we should address it. I, therefore, urge Government and moreso, the investigative and prosecuting organs of Government to take action as far as those mentioned in this report are concerned, so that they can bring them to book.
 
I would also urge you, honourable colleagues, to support Government to ensure that this issue of National IDs is complete by finding resources using all the possible ways. Thank you very much.
 
5.11
MR FRED EBIL (UPC, Kole County, Kole): Thank very much, Mr Speaker. Let me join my friends in thanking the committee for the good report. This was a good job done. It has produced good investigations, excellent observations and recommendations.  
Article 164(2) of the Constitution is very clear, “Any person holding a political or public office who directs or concurs in the use of public funds contrary to existing instructions shall be accountable for any loss arising from that use and shall be required to make good the loss even if he or she has ceased to hold that office.”  We have been debating these matters in this august House even in the last sittings. We saw the report on bicycles; we saw the report on Basajjabalaba about the compensation and now, it is the same kind of report on the Floor, and we have seen all these people go scot-free, Mr Speaker, not even with an interdiction or being held liable for the crimes they have committed. 

Article 164(2) of the Constitution is very clear; my opinion is that those who are found liable in this report - we are tired of always losing a lot of taxpayer’s money. The government releases money, but it ends up in the hands of a few people without providing services to the people of Uganda. Everybody liable in this report is not going to escape Article 164 of the Constitution. (Applause)

5.14
MS GRACE NAMARA (Independent, Woman Representative, Lyantonde): Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is less than a year since this Parliament and the public received a shock from the bicycle saga and here we are, receiving yet another shock. I thank the committee for this elaborate report from which I would like to dwell on single-sourcing. It is true that in this procurement, the minister was supposed to first of all work with the PPDA, which they never did. PPDA went ahead to advise them to go for open bidding, but they never listened; the Solicitor General went ahead to advise them on open bidding, but they still did not listen and opted for single-sourcing. Even in the President’s letter, they are basing on, was only advisory. If I can specifically refer to his letter in Annex IV, the President is saying that if they want to go for single-sourcing, they should first of all get the facts about this company that took over the project, which they did not do.
 
He went ahead to recommend that the minister should first go to Congo Brazzaville to find out how far they had gone with the project there because they were also had a contract there. But they never did it. 

He went ahead to recommend that they go out in the market to compare the prices if they were seriously interested in single-sourcing, but they still did not do it. They only opted for single-sourcing as a deliberate move to maybe make money or to reap from public coiffeurs. 

So, Mr Speaker on that note, I would like to recommend that the minister then and the honourable Alintuma Nsambu should, first of all, be prosecuted for not adhering to the PPDA advice and secondly, for not adhering to the letter which the President wrote. Thirdly, for not adhering to what the Solicitor General advised. 

5.17
MR GODFREY LUBEGA (Independent, Kassanda County North, Mubende): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. It is very unfortunate that one of the candidates is being discussed in the House as a corrupt person. To my surprise, as you may be aware, he is one of the candidates being backed by the ruling party. You can imagine what is on the ground when you say or when a team from the ruling party goes to convince the voters that he is the right candidate. Is it not wise and time that the party withdrew his candidature? (Laughter) 

When you come to Kassanda, Mr Speaker and see how schools and hospitals are collapsing, you would wonder why we still have corrupt ministers in this nation. I think this is a very unfortunate situation because anytime he is announced a winner, he will come back for the ministerial post. My opinion is that if the ruling party is in position, this is the right time to check and withdraw the candidature of this gentleman. That is my opinion.

5.19
MS SARAH KAYAGI (NRM, Woman Representative, Manafwa): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the committee for the report and I want to register my disappointment that in this House, the Members of Parliament and the Executive have been implicated in issues to do with corruption. We are voted by our voters, to come here and speak for them not to steal.

Politicians have taken the political responsibility by stepping aside. Some have taken administrative responsibility by leaving their offices. But what they have failed to do is to take the financial responsibility of refunding the resources that have been embezzled.

We are doing a disservice to this country and to our voters. If one person or a few of them can take Ugshs 200 billion or can lead to a loss of Ugshs 200 billion and we let it go, what is the use of us coming here, debating such a motion or report and in the end there are no results regarding recovery of resources that have been embezzled?

I think it is time that the recommendations made by Parliament be implemented, and that those who have stolen this money be brought to book. If they have left Parliament, they have some assets around. We should follow them up, confiscate them, sell their assets and return the money to the Ugandans so that we can develop our country.

In Bududa people died. If we had utilised these resources and had this system in place, maybe we would have known how many people were in that village and in that sub-county and we would not just be estimating and saying maybe the number was this.

So, Mr Speaker, the idea was good, but the way the money is passed on to these ministries and the way money is utilised and is being taken day in, day out is really a serious issue. It is something that the country outside there and the voters that sent us here are crying about.

I want to implore the House that you should join me to condemn - (Member timed out.)

5.23
MS JUDITH AMOIT (NRM, Woman Representative, Pallisa): Thank you so much, Mr Speaker. In the same vein, I also want to thank the committee for the work well done. I would also like to thank Parliament for the spirit that they are mounting against corruption. I think this is the way to go.

I also want to rise and condemn our leaders on the front bench, whom we have entrusted, and whom we believe in to deliver appropriately, but it is very unfortunate to see our Executive using their offices to embezzle, swindle and enrich their selfish ends. Theft is condemned even in the Bible. Who are we to continue holding these people with us? We must hold these people accountable and they should refund the money to help Ugandans.

When I read on page 15 paragraph (e) where they evoked the PPDA, it states, “In the same response, PPDA clearly stated that it was not changing its position and if this was not agreeable to the ministry, the accounting officer would take full responsibility for the conduct of the procurement process in line with Section 26 of the PPDA Act.”

But you will realise that in paragraph (f) it reads, “The accounting officer issued a response to the authority in this letter dated 15 March 2010, annex 5, informing the authority that the procurement was not the business of PPDA.”

If the Executive cannot understand the Acts of PPDA, what about the rest of the civil servants down at the local levels? They are misbehaving and have financial indiscipline. How far should we continue with our people in this corrupt manner?

My prayer in this context is that these people, Nsambu and the NRM flag-bearer, must return our money. I serve in Pallisa District and in this budget we have had a raw deal for the district. Maybe if this money was available, it could help me to get a passable murram road -(Member timed out.)

5.26
MR BAKER SSALI (NRM, Buikwe County West, Buikwe): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to start by thanking the committee for coming up with such a report. The way I look at this report and the recommendations that were made by the committee, I think that they were not enough. They were shallow in nature because we have had many examples around here where people have been taken to court and they have come back scot-free and some of them have not been charged. 

Others have been cleared and others charged and fined peanuts. That is why I say that the recommendations have been shallow. As some Members have put it, I recommend that those who have been implicated in this report should have their properties confiscated and sold off to recover our money.

The former Minister of Finance that is hon. Syda Bbumba has been exonerated, but the way I see this issue and this report, it is almost the same as that one of the bicycle saga. Because they went ahead to pay the money without questioning where that money was going or whether that money was being paid in order or there was value-for-money. Much as their duty was to mobilise the funds and ensure that the money had been paid out, they also had the duty to make sure that this money must be accounted for and there must be value for that very money paid out. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, let me make a small procedural communication. Our Rules of Procedure prescribe the dignified manner in which a Member of Parliament should cheer the other one speaking. Our Rules of Procedure even prohibit clapping of hands and yet I think clapping of hands is more dignified than clapping chairs. But clapping hands is prohibited by the rules. 

What the rules, however, allow, is that for the honourable member to be called “honourable”, he or she must politely hit on the bar under the seat to celebrate. It is called foot stamping. The wooden thing behind your seat is what you hit to show -(Laughter)- The rules of the House also insist that every Member must wear a pair of shoes. (Laughter) That is part of the facilitation for you to be able to stamp on the wooden bar. So, it is not dignified for a Member of Parliament to rise up and start hitting the chair so loud. Even the sound that you portray on the wooden panel under your feet should be dignified. (Laughter) It is becoming a matter of concern to the Chair to see honourable members rising up and almost standing and starting to beat the chair so viciously. So, honourable members, I urge you to observe the rules and behave in a manner that -(Laughter)

Honourable members, the Parliament has received a request from Dr Mike Findley, Associate Director of Political Economy and Development, and Professor of Political Science at Brigham Young University, USA; and Dr Helen Milner, Director of Nehru Centre for Globalisation and Governance and Forbes Professor of Public Affairs at Princeton University, USA, to conduct a survey among Members of Parliament up to 30 July 2012. The survey seeks to understand what preferences MPs have over development projects and the roles of NGOs in the development process. It is hoped that this will lead to projects being implemented where they are most needed. Please, accord them the necessary co-operation to enable them complete this valuable assignment. Thank you.

Honourable members, those of you who contributed viscously to the earlier debate, the matter is still the same. Let us give opportunity to the other Members who did not say anything. The debate is not ending today, so would you allow the Chair to exercise his discretion in the catching of his eye? 

5.33
MR MUDIMI WAMAKUYU (NRM, Bulambuli County, Bulambuli): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for this opportunity. I also thank Members for the report. This matter started sometime back. It is not recent. This project was supposed to be handled by the Electoral Commission and Uganda Bureau of Statistics, but it was frustrated at the initial point by Ministry of Internal Affairs, which clearly explained to the President that this was a security issue which must be handled by Internal Affairs. So, the other agencies were left out. It is clear in the report here. I have seen where the report is recommending that they pay the balance. What are they paying the balance against? The 200 IDs produced or against what? There could be benchmarks. You pay against specific activities. I do not think the paying of their obligations is correct because we should have only paid for 200 IDs and I am among the 200 who have got the IDs. 

It is clear the President was correct in his writing. He said they have to work with other agencies, but these people hijacked the directive of the President. I do not think Electoral Commission and other agencies were involved very much in this process. I have seen where he has indicated that the Miluka chiefs - this could have reduced the cost of the project, but the Miluka chiefs were not involved in this process.

What I want the committee also to find out is the big sums of money, which they paid out as allowances for those people who attended the committee. I was in the ministry one time and I saw a certain payment in dollars. You sit for a day and they give you $400 just for 200. We need to find out. There is more money, which was paid out as allowances for those people who are part of the team, which is not indicated here. I want the minister to ask the PS to avail the list of the payment in dollars. We are Ugandans, we sit and they pay you in dollars? Are we honest to our country? Are we protecting our currency? That means in future even the tax payments will be in dollars. I want the minister to give us all the payments, which were made because I have seen some in dollars - huge sums of money!

As Members have clearly indicated, we have to find a way to bring these people to book. Hon. Kirunda-Kivejjinja is out, but he is a Ugandan and he is around -(Member timed out.)

5.37
MS EVELYN ANITE (NRM, Youth Representative): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I want to first of all thank the chair of the committee for ably and eloquently presenting the report to us yesterday. I want to extend special thanks to the committee members because their report has acted as an eye-opener to very many Ugandans and very many Members of Parliament.

As Ugandans, we are almost getting tempted to go with the whole idea of saying that Ugandans should contribute towards the national identity cards. At this point, I want to categorically and clearly state that not a single soul in this country should contribute towards the national identity card! The reason is, the money was stolen and we cannot pay for what we have not done. The people who are involved in this saga, the PS, Ministry of Internal Affairs, the former minister, hon. Kivejinja and the Minister for Finance should take full responsibility and even finance and facilitate the identity cards for Ugandans because that is a double loss.

The money that they have stolen is taxpayers’ money. Why are they again coming to us? Why is Government again coming to Ugandans asking them to pay more money? We cannot pay twice for something that we have already paid for. So, I am urging that we move around the country to discourage Ugandans and tell them, “The person who has eaten your money is called honourable so and so, and is in this place; do not pay, but rather ask them to pay on your behalf.” Thank you.

5.39
MS FLORENCE NAMAYANJA (DP, Bukoto County East, Masaka): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to air out my views. I would like first of all to thank the committee for the work they have done to expose some of these people who have been posing as straight people and yet they are not.

On page 17, in the report, I am surprised that non-officials are included in the transactions of Government business. I wonder what kind of interest hon. Alintuma Nsambu had to bring non-government officials and even pay for them to go and transact business on behalf of the government. It is also very unfortunate that the Electoral Commission is using kits for the voters’ registration, which are being used in the by-elections. We are aware that Alintuma Nsambu is contesting in Bukoto South. He is pausing right now as having imported the software, which is being used for the voters’ register. We are even worried that these systems may have been manipulated. 

I would like the NRM Government, if they are committed to fighting corruption, to come out and make a statement and pronounce themselves on the candidature of Alintuma Nsambu. If he is one of the people who are mentioned in this report, I wonder whether NRM Government still owns Alintuma Nsambu as their flagbearer and moreover a person coming from another constituency in the same term of office -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, I think you are going beyond what you are permitted under the discussions beforehand. Please, decency requires that you stay within the rules.

MS FLORENCE NAMAYANJA: I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker. This Parliament is committed to fighting corruption and it is the pronouncement of the President of Uganda that we fight corruption. I am seeing personalities mentioned in this report and one of them is John Chrysostom Alintuma Nsambu -(Member timed out.)

5.43
MR KENNETH KIYINGI (Independent, Mawokota County South, Mpigi): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for this wonderful opportunity given to me. Allow me to add my voice to those voices from honourable colleagues that thanked the committee for a job well done.

Allow me yet again to address the plight of millions of Ugandans out there, especially the young people, the Ugandans below 20 years that are going to actually sweat to pay back the loans that we are actually passing as Parliament. It is really absurd. To what extent shall we go to pass loans and at the end of the day have all these monies misused by people in public office? I am really getting very intolerant to this kind of act and it is my humble appeal to Government to actually act critically to avoid such incidences from coming up. It is going to hurt the future generation because when I look at maybe the Parliament of 2030, which I will be very eager to observe, it will be very absurd if we do not address this matter to avoid the Ugandans that will be actually fighting hard to pay back the loans that we are actually amassing and having misused by people in public office that are not acting in the right way.

I also need honourable colleagues for us to look into the matter of warrants or insurance on this equipment that we did get that is actually lying misused in Entebbe. Is there any warrant attached to this equipment? Was there any insurance? Is the equipment now not expired? If it is in that nature, we need to actually look into how much we can get back if the equipment was insured. If the equipment has warrant, we also need to fight hard to see that we get the money back or we get equipment back from the manufacturers as early as possible.
 
As I conclude, Mr Speaker, I believe it is high time we have zero-tolerance to corruption in our country because it is becoming too much. We need to fight hard as a country; we need to set an example as the Ninth Parliament to fight corruption. The time is now and we shall not wait for tomorrow to beat corruption from our country. Thank you.

5.46
MR JACK WAMANGA-WAMAI (FDC, Mbale Municipality, Mbale): Thank you very much, Mr speaker. May I also thank the committee for the job well done. For a country to plan for its people, you need a national ID and it is indeed a great shame that Uganda, of all countries in the region, does not have an ID.  If we had an ID, there would be no need for us to rush during elections because everybody would have been registered and this country would not spend resources on carrying out census. You would know the number of people we have in the country. This was a wonderful project that should have been done some years back, but we see the money stolen here and there, and Ugandans up to date do not have an ID. 

I feel ashamed as a Member of Parliament to have been given an ID and I want to declare today, that the ID I was given as a Member of Parliament was a bribe and I am going to return it. Ugandans are entitled to national IDs as Ugandan nationals, and the government must bear the cost. To provide every Uandan, who is born an ID, is the responsibility of Government. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, which was given this responsibility, mishandled the issue and singlehandedly, the Permanent Secretary with the Third Deputy Prime Minister known as “KK” took the whole issue in their hands and mismanaged it. They did not do due diligence to find out about this company in Germany. Singlehandedly picked on this company!

Now, the committee in this report did not identify the person who convinced this country, who convinced the President with the Third Deputy Prime Minister when they met. This person who went and convinced the President and pointed out only this company is not mentioned. 

There are two other companies, which were interested in printing the IDs for Ugandans. Member timed out.)

5.49
MS ROSEMARY NAUWAT (NRM, Woman Representative, Amudat): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for this opportunity. I would like to thank the committee for their report and I would also like to add my voice to that of the Members to condemn the anomalies in the ID project and the level of corruption exhibited by the officers mentioned. 

On page 5 of the report, we are told that the purpose, among others, of this project, is for personalisation and issuance of the ID cards for efficient proof of identity. Already, some Members have received and I am one of them. However -(Interjections)- yes, I have already received the national identity card and there are a lot of inaccuracies in those IDs. Whereas they want proof of identity, you will realise that on some of these identity cards, for example, in mine, I come from Amudat District and they say – when they were capturing our information, they were asking for our home address and the address of the areas where we reside. What they have captured is the address of my place of residence here in Kampala. But now, what I know is that we shall use that identity card for quite some time, and with such inaccurate information, it will tantamount to something like forgery. 

On page 40, we are also being updated on the status of the project and we are being told that, among other things, that this company has fulfilled its obligation under the contract and, therefore, it had already done something like mass enrolment of the nationals and they are looking at the final contractual payment close to Shs 40 billion. With the inaccuracies in these identity cards so far issued to the citizens, I request that before giving them the Shs 40 billion, they should first make corrections. They withdraw those identity cards from the Members and put proper information on the identity cards.

I thank you.

5.52
MR REMIGIO ACHIA (NRM, Pian County, Nakapiripirit): Thank you, Mr Speaker. You know, one day the Pharisees brought an adulterous woman before Him and asked, “Jesus, this woman is an adulterer. We need, according to our rules, to stone her.” Jesus told them, “If any of you has not committed any sin, should be the first to throw a stone.” Where is the frontbench to throw the first stone at corruption? 

Secondly, when you want to steal, a thief does not steal at leisure. Time is of utmost importance; very fast, very quick and out of the gate. If you go to the annexes, the President wrote to the Minister of Internal Affairs on the 2 April 2009, but the minister did not reply until the President wrote again on the 13th of February 2010, that is Annex 2, reminding the Prime Minister and Minister of Internal Affairs to go ahead with the project. What is happening to the ID project? Let none of you remember that this project was National Security Intelligence System. It was basically an ID and the committee has confirmed that.

From then on, when they got some form of green light to go ahead, on the 4 March 2010, that is a year later, these people are into action. The Minister of Internal Affairs wrote to PPDA demanding that they had been directed to go for single-sourcing. They wanted permission. On the 11th of March, seven days later, the PS of Internal Affairs also wrote demanding for single-sourcing. On the 12 March 2010, the following day, the director PPDA replied and said, “We have rejected this,” and he said it clearly. Let me read it: “The procurement of a national ID should be subjected to open and competitive bidding. In the event that the above position is not acceptable to your entity, should you decide as the accounting officer to proceed under national security concern, you should take full responsibility.” 

The following day, the 15th, the PS, Mr Kagoda, wrote a very angry letter, that is Annex 5, and basically told off the Executive Director, PPDA in his letter point No.6: “Procurement was not a business of PPDA but could be handled under classified expenditure.” So, he dismissed them. Immediately after the 15th, on the 18th, he sought permission from the Attorney-General, Khiddu Makubuya. Makubuya cleared him and the following day, actually on the 19th, Khiddu signed clearing them. The same day, the contract was signed. A few days later, money was paid -(Member timed out.)

5.56
MR VINCENT MUJUNI (NRM, Rwampara County, Mbarara): Thank you so much, Mr Speaker. I want to thank you for this opportunity. I want to refer to the Bible. When you read John 10:10 it says: “A thief comes to steal, kill and destroy.” So, they came to steal; they got the money and they have destroyed the ID project and that’s it. We cannot sit down and see this thieving with impunity. We must make thieving with impunity very risky. Today, I met someone whom we implicated as having stolen some property; because the DPP said there was nothing, there was no case they almost pushed us. One of these days we shall be killed for no good reason. I mean - the reason is, where is the moral authority, where is the will to fight this corruption we are talking about? They find you with a mast, they go there, then the one of 75 percent, they say “No, you did not steal.” Then the one of 25 percent - because Magyezi has no money, they say, “Go to prison.” It is actually becoming more honourable to steal than not to steal!

Mr Speaker, Attorney General; I invite you to Article 119. You were among the framers of the Constitution - I do not know, but you will guide me. I think we give so much power to the Attorney-General. We need to maybe amend the Constitution. If you went to the Solicitor General’s Office and saw how many agreements - and you know how bulky these agreements, treaties and everything are – and they are there and they are under-staffed. You would imagine they make these mistakes sometimes unknowingly. Why don’t we allow every department to employ a legal officer and they scrutinise the agreements, scrutinise the documents? For how long shall this Parliament kill Makubuya? Because he was on the frontbench, he is gone. Now they are saying we chase him from the backbench; where shall we find him? Do you want this man to commit suicide?

We need to find the cause in the law; the accounting officer. Mr Speaker, I want to invite you to look at Article 164(1). The permanent secretary has the guts to tell you that the PPDA is none of your business; and he is still in office. The other day on the bicycles scandal, we interdicted the people responsible for it. Now I want to see his interdiction – if he is still in office – immediately of this very office; that is how we shall rid that ministry of corruption. 

Finally, I want to support that bill if it comes for your leave; give them leave. We must attach the property of the thieves. They have stolen the money, they have it and they can kill us, they can beat us, they can even pay off the court. They can do anything because they have all it takes. Thank you very much and may our country be at peace.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, we will be closing at 6.00 O’clock to go and freshen up so that we can come back tomorrow at 2.00 O’clock and continue with this debate. So, I will allow only one person to contribute.

MR XAVIER KYOOMA (NRM, Ibanda County North, Ibanda): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the chairman and his committee and also congratulate them upon this report. Surely, we are looking at a situation where people are openly stealing the resources of this country at the expense of our people. When you look at page 5 of the report, you find that the whole project was supposed to be implemented in three phases. 

The timeline is not indicated. When you look at page 9, you find that by now the project should have been completed because, first of all, the intentions were good. The first was to cover the elections in 2011. The elections were completed, but they were not covered by this project, meaning that there was a serious opportunity cost to that effect. 

Secondly, it was supposed to be concerned with the issuance of national IDs. That too has not yet been done, which is a very big opportunity cost. And also, local governments were supposed to use the same project to update births and deaths. It was also supposed to be used in the census, which was slated for this year. 

All these activities were supposed to be aided by this project and we suffered a very big opportunity cost. And this implies that Government incurred a cost that would otherwise have been met by the project. So, to that extent, we have to note that there was no value-for-money –(Interjection)– before I am cut off, I support the recommendations and conclusions and all the content of the report. 

Mr Speaker, on page 10, we see a scenario, where an organ of the government, PPDA, took a step and objected to single-sourcing. But because of the ill-motives of the people who were involved, they ignored that. You also notice on page 10(g) that a report by ESO indicated that this company which was given the contract had a bad report –(Member timed out.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I will very grudgingly allow hon. Alice Alaso to be the last one today because she has some issues. Tomorrow, I will start with the Members who are here now. Those who attend the House and go away will not catch my eye tomorrow. So, please be punctual tomorrow and we start with you.

MS ALICE ALASO (FDC, Woman Representative, Serere): Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you for understanding my plight indeed. Mr Speaker, whenever there is a financial scandal in this country, whether it is CHOGM, Temangalo, bicycles, Basajjabalaba and now the IDs, there are four or five things you will find. 

First of all, there will be bad advice from the Attorney-General’s Office; two, they would abuse the PPDA; three, there would be expenses not appropriated by this Parliament. Once they begin using money before we budget for it, you should smell a rat. Four, there would be a President whose advise has been misunderstood; and five, there would be all sorts of excesses and no deliverables at the end of the day and Ugandans will be the losers. 

Mr Speaker, I would like to advise the President; if he does not want to be associated with corruption, he should stop giving advice that will be misinterpreted! (Applause) 

Secondly, while I appreciate the great work done by the committee, they continue to state that the stakeholders asked for more funding. May I suggest to the committee, that if they had referred to the implementation plan for this ID project, there was a point where we should have 3.5 million IDs issued before we paid the final monies. Can we first have those IDs at the cost of what we have already paid before this House recommends additional money to Muhlbauer or any other thing? 

Mr Speaker, the other thing I would like to raise here is whether the committee actually visited the house where the equipment is kept. We are told the house is rat-infested, and the equipment has been stolen. What is the status now? Should we just disband this whole project at the expense of Ugandans who have paid?

Finally, over Shs 250 billion is what we are talking about. Can the honourable Prime Minister come here and withdraw that portion in the budget speech, which requires Ugandans to pay for IDs or cost-share because we have already paid. It is our entitlement; we need these IDs for immigration, voting and for everything and we cannot pay any additional shilling. Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much, honourable members. I re-state my ruling of yesterday, which I repeated today that tomorrow will be the last day for us to receive ministerial policy statements. So, the ministries that have not yet tabled their ministerial policy statements before the House should do so tomorrow. Otherwise, they will have to take it through the back door which will not be proper for the House. House adjourned to tomorrow at 2.00 O’clock. 

(The House rose at 6.07 p.m. and was adjourned to Thursday, 5 July 2012 at 2.00p.m.)
