MINISTERIAL POLICY STATEMENT FOR THE MINISTRY OF EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY AFFAIRS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2012/2013

2.28
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION (Mr Asuman Kiyingi): Mr Speaker, I beg to lay the ministerial policy statement for the Ministry of East African Community Affairs for the financial year 2012/2013 - Vote 021. I beg to lay.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let the record capture that. Thank you very much. 

Honourable members, it does seem now that six ministries have not as of today presented their policy statements to this House, which is a violation of the ruling of the Speaker, which has been made, re-made, emphasised and they are required to make this presentation and also to make an apology to the House for delaying their committee work. It is not fair to this House. These policy statements should have been made available to this House by the 30th of last month. Today is the 5th and these statements are not printed. They are delaying the committee work and this House will be delayed. We should not be blamed for any delays which will happen during the budget process. 

Honourable members, in the Distinguished Strangers’ Gallery, we have law students and lawyers from Uganda Christian Lawyers Fraternity and their colleagues from Lawyers Christian Fellowship based in the United Kingdom. They have come to observe the proceedings of Parliament. Please join me in welcoming them this afternoon. (Applause) You are very welcome. 

2.31
MR ODONGA OTTO (FDC, Aruu County, Pader): Mr Speaker, in line with your communication that the ministers were directed by the Speaker to present the policy statements - they should have done that five days ago. In the circumstances, I see the front bench is fairly empty. I do not know if the deputy Government Chief Whip, hon. Bahati, could take it up and explain or inform the ministers that violation of the Speaker’s directive amounts to a breach of our Rules of Procedure and has grave implications. I thought it would be prudent for someone from the government side to make a formal commitment to that effect other than it passing with the wind. I think it will be very important for residents in this House. Mr Speaker, I beg for your indulgence.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, this House is supposed to start at 2 O’clock. That is when we start business. Do I see some ministers ready with the ministerial policy statements? Can we start with – is that Finance and Internal Affairs? Can we go to item 3(VI)? 

MINISTERIAL POLICY STATEMENT FOR THE MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2012/2013

2.32
THE MINISTER OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr Hillary Onek): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am going to table before Parliament our policy statement, which contains votes 009 and 120 –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is Vote 009?

MR ONEK: These are the expenditures -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: State the details of the vote.

MR ONEK: Vote 009 is the vote for the Ministry of Internal Affairs headquarters, and Vote 120 is the National Citizenship and Immigration Control -(Interjections)- Vote 144 is Uganda Police Force and then Vote 145 is Prisons Services. 

Mr Speaker, I hereby table this. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: For which financial year? 

MR ONEK: For the financial year 2012/2013 presented to Parliament for debate of the estimates of revenue and expenditure by hon. Hillary Onek, MP, Minister of Internal Affairs. (Laughter)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let the records capture that. Thank you, honourable minister.  Can we go to 3(VII)?

MINISTERIAL POLICY STATEMENT FOR THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2012/2013

2.34
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (PRIVATISATION) (Mr Aston Kajara): Thank you, Mr Speaker, and honourable members. First of all, I apologise for being unable to table this statement as per the requirement of the Budget Act. The reasons were that the printing took long. It took long for the service provider to have it in place, but we have managed to secure it. I wish to table before the House the Ministerial Policy Statement for the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development for the financial year 2012/2013. In this policy statement is included Vote 008 for the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, Vote 130 for the Treasury Operations, Vote 141 for Uganda Revenue Authority, Vote 153 for Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority and Vote 143 for Uganda Bureau of Statistics. I beg to lay.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let the records capture that. Thank you. Guidance?

MS ANYWAR: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am seeking your guidance. I was seeing the honourable Minister of Internal Affairs laying the policy statement on the Table. But I am not sure whether it is a draft copy or a final copy. I am familiar with the policy statements given to this House. What I can see is a spiral-bound document. I do not know whether it is a draft or a final copy, which the Minister of Internal Affairs is trying to present to this House. If so, should it be received as a policy statement for the Ministry of Internal Affairs? I need your guidance, Mr Speaker. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a duck. This is a ministerial policy statement. I have looked at it. It may not be bound in the normal form, but it is a ministerial policy statement. [MS ANYWAR: “Is it a draft? We need a clarification from him.”]

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: It is already laid before the House, so it is property of the House.

2.37
THE MINISTER OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr Hillary Onek): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to clarify to my sister, Beatrice Anywar -(Interjections)- and the House that the document I presented is a complete document. The other copies are being bound and will be brought here. Since a complete -(Interjections)- what you need is the content not the form. 

MS ANYWAR: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I stand on a point of order. I have been in this House for six years and we have been receiving ministerial policy statements. I have not, even once, seen us receive a ministerial statement in the form the Minister of Internal Affairs is presenting it to the House today. Even as he is laying it, it is the only odd document in appearance from the rest of the documents from other ministers. We had asked for clarification because it is not the normal way of presenting this document. Instead of the honourable minister apologising –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The order?

MS ANYWAR: Yes, instead of him apologising for trying to smuggle into the House a new form of presentation of a ministerial policy statement, he is going on to justify that that is the document which we should accept yet it is not a precedent of this House to receive ministerial policy statements in a spiral-bound form. Is the honourable minister in order? Instead of apologising he wants to enforce a procedure that is not acceptable to this House. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I have ruled on that matter, honourable members. There is the policy statement. Can I have hon. Banyenzaki?

2.40
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR ECONOMIC MONITORING (OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT) (Mr Henry Banyenzaki): Mr Speaker and honourable Members of Parliament, I beg to lay on the Table the ministerial policy statement for the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives for votes 015, 110 and 154. 

2.40
MR ODONGA-OTTO (FDC, Aruu County, Pader): Mr Speaker, earlier on, I asked hon. Bahati, the Deputy Whip of the NRM, to respond as to why the ministers had not followed the Speaker’s directive to present ministerial policy statements by the end of last month. 

Now that the Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Leader of Government Business, hon. Gen. Moses Ali, is in the House, could I find out from him why the Speaker’s directive has not been followed in ensuring that all the ministers present their policy statements before this House so that the committees can begin their work? Let him explain what is happening to the members of the front bench.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members and Leader of Government Business, we have not received ministerial statements from the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Justice – we have not received those statements. And as you are aware, the law dictates that the statements should have been in the House by the 30th of last month. I made directives in this chair for the last three days, today being the third day and I still do not see total compliance. Could you explain to the House what is going on?

2.42
THE THIRD DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND DEPUTY LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Lt Gen. (Rtd) Moses Ali): Thank you, Mr Speaker. First of all, I would like to apologise for the ministers not following your instructions. In fact, after meeting you yesterday, we even informed the ministers in Cabinet that you have given this directive. So, why they have not done so, I do not know; I cannot even explain. 

So, it is not proper really for honourable members to ask somebody who does not even know why they have not come.(Laughter). So, I have no answer for – the Minister of Agriculture is here. We may give him a chance to explain. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can we go back to item 3(III).

MINISTERIAL POLICY STATEMENT FOR THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL INDUSTRIES AND FISHERIES FOR FINANCIAL YEAR 2012/13

2.44
THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL INDUSTRIES AND FISHERIES (Mr Tress Buchanayandi): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I beg to lay on Table the ministerial policy statement for the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industries and Fisheries for the financial year 2012/2013. I beg to lay. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: There are some other ministries which have not complied, who will take appropriate action on this? 

QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER

2.45
MS JESCA ABABIKU (Independent, Woman Representative, Adjumani): Thank you, Mr Speaker and honourable members. 

QUESTION 20/1/09

2.45
THE THIRD DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (Gen. (Rtd) Moses Ali): Once again, I am sorry, Mr Speaker, but I will find out why –(Laughter)– I beg that we stand over this question until the minister is available. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Rt Hon. Prime Minister, are you also from Adjumani by any chance?

GEN. MOSES ALI: Yes, I am from Adjumani and she is also from Adjumani, but I am not the Minister of Local Government.(Laughter)

2.46
DR FRANCIS EPETAIT (FDC, Ngora County, Ngora): Mr Speaker, we have a very serious lacuna on the side of Government. The Prime Minister’s Office is now being put into ridicule trying to explain things he does not know. We really have to fault the Frontbench. We have a lot of business to handle; we have to debate the State of the Nation Address; we have to debate the Budget and pass it within the legally allowed time, and there is a lot of pending business. The Frontbench on the Government side is just not serious. I think there is need for the Prime Minister’s Office to take more serious steps in whipping the Frontbench rather than just saying, “I will find out”. 

This particular question has a timeframe. We have been asking Government time and again about LCs. Perhaps the increased crime rate in the country is because of this lacuna. We need answers rather than just saying we shall find out. I think the Frontbench owes this House an apology.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Rt Hon. Prime Minister, this matter is becoming a problem. This is not fair any more.

2.48
MR ODONGA OTTO (FDC, Aruu County, Pader): Mr Speaker, I think we need to be a little more resolute on members of the front bench. The Order Paper is processed by the Clerk’s Office. The Clerk to Parliament is appointed by the President and many times the Order Paper is done in consultation with members of the Executive in consideration of their priorities and interests of Government. 

This casual approach of the Executive coming to this House properly dressed in suits and neck ties, knowing very well they are mean’t to come and transact parliamentary business - there are people from various constituencies all over the country and they are not getting appropriate responses. 

Mr Speaker, I seek your guidance on whether it would not be prudent to move a motion at this particular moment, expressing displeasure in the conduct of Government business in this House and asking the President to take immediate action –(Interjections)–  we cannot continue like this. There are so many people willing to be ministers; some are even more competent than those on the front bench. Parliamentary business should not be conducted at the mercy and will of those who are on the front bench. 

2.49
MR BAKA MUGABI (NRM, Bukooli County North, Bugiri): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I also what to thank hon. Otto for giving way. I think the ministers are overburdened. We know that the Frontbench lacks about 10 ministers and that means that some of the ministers are overburdened. Don’t you think that it is also high time we called upon the President to fill these vacant posts? (Laughter) It has taken so long and our colleagues are really overburdened -(Applause)- the members are not here, and so, we want to call upon the President that the cadres are already here to finish this work; otherwise our colleagues are very burdened. (Laughter)

MR ODONGA OTTO: Mr Speaker, I appreciate the fact that some positions of the Frontbench have not been filled. I also know that very many colleagues have been expecting to be ministers, including some of my personal friends –(Laughter)- they have been waiting endlessly. 

I will seek your indulgence to give me leave to move a formal motion to express displeasure on the casual manner in which members of the Executive are taking parliamentary business, moreso the directives of the Speaker. If it was a normal back bench Member of Parliament, probably I would sit down and relax, but for a Speaker to direct that these statements be brought before the House and the minister does not bring it to the House and no one is even there to apologise on behalf of the minister who is not present in Parliament - this is contempt of Parliament. 

Given the grave nature of this concern, I would not fall short of requesting that to show our seriousness in this matter, probably you consider adjourning Parliament for 10 minutes so that the Minister for Local Government can come and present that statement or the Leader of Government Business should come and apologise to this House that they are not in position to present that statement, because if you do not do that, tomorrow we shall have the same kind of situation. 

I seek your indulgence on whether it will not be prudent to have this House adjourned for some few minutes so that the Leader of Government Business can be more certain where the Minister for Local Government is so as to come and explain the status of LC I elections all over the country. I seek your indulgence.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, you have raised two issues; the issue of a formal motion to express displeasure, and you have also requested that this House be suspended for 10 minutes to show displeasure. If there was no other business on the Order Paper, I would be obliged to suspend the House, but we have other business coming soon and it is of great interest to the Members.

On the first request, I give you leave to present. I receive this as a notice for a motion. This motion should be received by Wednesday next week to express displeasure at the way business is being conducted in this House. So, notice is granted. The next item.

CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE SECTORAL COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE AND INTERNAL AFFAIRS ON THE INQUIRY INTO THE PROCUREMENT OF EQUIPMENT FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (NSIS); THE NATIONAL ID PROJECT

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, yesterday we started debate on this report and I made an undertaking to the Members who sat with me up to the end. Those of you who came and sat briefly and went away, you will not have audience quickly, so that you also sit with the Speaker for a long time. So, the Members who were with me up to the end – I will start with the honourable member for Fort Portal Municipality. You have three minutes.

2.54
MR ALEX RUHUNDA (NRM, Fort Portal Municipality, Kabarole): I thank you very much. Honourable members, let us direct our attention to the report, and I quickly want to commend the committee for the detailed research that they made, but when it comes to recommendations, it is an area where I felt that we needed to add more meat. For instance, on page 11, the recommendations made are obvious because these technocrats including their supervisors – we expect them to know the laws and regulations according to the PPDA. So, we do not even need to remind them about that, but I suggest we go straight to the sanctions and punishments. I am of the view that we need to see more concrete recommendations where the culprits are brought to book and are being punished.

When you get to page 14, our elderly politician, hon. Ali Kirunda Kivejinja – I was wondering at this point in time, when he is already out of the office, what kind of punishment we can really have for him, because he is out of the office – (Interjections)- [HON. MEMBER: “What are you talking about?”]. Now this is the time –(Interjections)- please Members, just be patient because we have found some weaknesses in the law. [MR HAMSON OBUA: “Information.”] Okay, allowed.

MR HAMSON OBUA: I thank you very much. May I inform the honourable holding the Floor that Article 164, Clause 2 of our national Constitution provides as follows, “Any person holding a political or public office, who directs or concurs in the use of public funds contrary to existing instructions, shall be accountable for any loss arising from that use and shall be required to make good the loss even if he or she has ceased to hold that office.” So, whether they are holding offices or they are outside, they can still be held accountable as per this provision of the law. I thank you. 

MR RUHUNDA: Qualifying that information, when we were scrutinising the Anti-Corruption Act, we realised there are gaps, and this is where I would urge the House to support one of us who is bringing a Private Member’s Bill in the amendment of the Anti-Corruption Act, to ensure the confiscation of the property; we really should have this Bill speeded up to enable us address this kind of scenario. 

When I read the entire report, I did not find this German company being implicated and sanctions put against it.  You have read in the papers that they are blacklisting our companies here. I hate using the word “blacklist” because it has racial connotations, but why can’t we do the same to this company. We have even heard what they did in Congo Brazzaville and we have not gone ahead to take any measure against this company. What they are recommending is for us to pay the balance of the money to this reckless company, which has really done a lot of damage to our country.

I would like to see stern measures also being taken against these crooks from abroad who pose because they have technology and take advantage of our vampire elite human beings who are here. We really need to be taking tougher measures on that.

When it comes to the accounting officer on page 16, the committee is non-committal to even name this person – the accounting officer - and yet in the bicycle saga, the accounting officer by the name of Kashaka was mentioned, and we asked the Prime Minister to take immediate action against this accounting officer. I would love to see the same principle being applied, Mr Speaker.

MR YAHAYA GUDOI (NRM, Bungokho County North, Mbale): Thank you, Mr Speaker –(Interjections)– don’t get surprised because I am one of the humble citizens in this country. But I would like to inform you that the report we are handling is a very sensitive one. Whenever I am in Mbale and also in my constituency, and people look at the size of my stomach, they say, those are corrupt Members of Parliament. But that is not all. Corruption is also associated with the President of Uganda, other Members of Parliament and all civil servants.

I don’t normally stand to say nothing – corruption has touched me a lot. When this report came out, I read it. And as a former teacher, I tried to understand it correctly, line by line. I would like to say that somewhere somehow, the evidence was adduced with the suspects being known.

My advice to Government is that it is time we handled situations as they are; we should not hide anything. Let all those involved in this mess be brought before the law. I am saying this because we have always debated issues of corruption very well, but after the debate, we tend to leave those implicated at large. That is why my suggestion is that at least this time, we should have these people arrested and taken to prison as we talk about this corruption matter. I think that will have some impact. You know that when we started, people said that this Ninth Parliament was doing a lot of work on corruption. But where have we reached? The trend of events shows that things are changing from face to face.

So, as an elder and a senior citizen of Uganda, I would like to call upon you to handle corrupt people with an iron hand, especially those who are reflected in this report – and I hope the Prime Minister is hearing. Please let us have these people arraigned before courts of law and we see how they will defend themselves. I thank you.

MS GRACE FREEDOM KWIYUCWINY (NRM, Woman Representative, Zombo): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I stand to support this report and thank the committee for the good work done. The report clearly says that PPDA wrote to advise the ministry on the procurement procedure, but that this advice was not followed.

The PPDA wrote its advice on 12 March and the contract was signed on 19 March, but on 17 November 2011, two and half years later, the contracts committee met and resolved that they had observed that the contract had already been signed. Their opinion was that it was an emergency situation in which the equipment supplied would seriously deteriorate – they approved the procedure retrospectively.

Mr Speaker and honourable members, I have never seen an irresponsible contracts committee as this one. Imagine they met two and a half years after the contract had been awarded with some work already going on, but they could not even help in monitoring it. That is why the report says that there was no progress report given anywhere up to the time when this committee was meeting.

From this, I note that the committee did a lot of disservice – I actually do not know how to describe the members of this committee. I don’t know whether they are the right people to be there. My sense is that they should be the first people to be disbanded yet I don’t see any recommendation in this report about them.

It is this same committee that was involved in the preparation of the contract in which they recommended that 1.5 percent of the total invoice per month be added if payments were not received by maturity date. You can imagine these people recommending such, yet they know some of our challenges about the release of monies on time. They shouldn’t have been the ones to make such a recommendation because that meant that Uganda would start to lose money immediately, given such delays in the releases.

That is why the committee observed that over Shs 7 billion has accrued as a result of that 1.5 percent per month. Given that background, should someone really still sit in that office?

As a way forward, why is the committee recommending that the Ministry of Finance should release more Shs 127 billion? Who is going to implement this project? What has changed now? What shows that this same committee or any other person now present is going to do a better job? I would like to suggest that the permanent secretary and all the other committee members should give way for a new team to come on board. We still need this ID project. We need this data to plan; we need the register for our elections and many other vital activities. So, we need to have committed people to implement this project and not those who will take us through this kind of mess again. 

3.08
MR STANLEY OMWONYA (NRM, Okoro County, Zombo): Thank you, Mr Speaker. First of all, I would like to thank the committee for doing a commendable job. It is unfortunate that we are starting this Session again with a discussion on corruption. I am saying this because we started the last session with a discussion on corruption. So, where are we going and where shall we end? It is unfortunate.

On page 39 of the report, it is stated that the project was procured in haste without plan, no budget and with no clear source of funding. How could this happen when the contractors were paid for the project? Where did they get the money to pay these contractors? If they got it, under what budget line was it.

Mr Speaker and honourable members, you will realise that last year when we wanted to increase the salaries for teachers, Government said they did not have the money. But for this very project the money was found. Why? Was it because those people concerned knew they would not benefit if the teachers’ salaries had been increased?

My other concern is the involvement of His Excellency the President in procurement-related issues. Why should a whole President get involved in the procurement issues? What interest did he have? And why did he advise the Ministry of Internal Affairs to consider single-sourcing for the project.

I totally agree with the recommendation of the committee that all those involved and implicated in the loss of the ID project should be brought to book because we need to fight corruption up to its logical conclusion.

3.11
MR EDWARD BALIDDAWA (NRM, Kigulu County North, Iganga): I rise to support the recommendations in the report and I would like to express our appreciation to the committee for presenting this report. I want to draw the House to two things; this project, right from the beginning, had two major misrepresentations. 

One, was that this was considered a classified procurement. This project had nothing to do with classified procurement. The context of classified was used to hoodwink Ugandans in order to hastily go through the procurement procedure. What is classified on getting generic information or data? This is information that is collected in the passport office, by the Electoral Commission, and by Bank of Uganda when issuing financial statements; there is nothing classified here. However, because they wanted to circumvent the system, they classified it as such and in order to hoodwink Ugandans further, they went and added in the aspect of security. That is why the national ID system was renamed, “National Information Security System”.

This is not the first time we are dealing with the ID project. I do recall that six years ago, we had an ID procurement process where Contex Global and Face Technologies were involved. That bidding process was stopped because there was alleged corruption. But now it turns out to be a national security information system and this explains why this project was placed under Ministry of Internal Affairs. This is because the minister of Internal Affairs is naturally the Chairman of the National Security Committee and that is how you have hon. Kirunda Kivejinja in it.

The second form of misrepresentation was that the company that was procuring lied to us that they were going to give us “a turnkey” solution. Meaning that you pay the 64 million Euros and you get five million cards. That was total misrepresentation because after giving them the money, you would need money for operations, for collection centres, and for mass rollout, and that is why they are asking for more money.

We owe Muhlbauer Shs 40 billion as the balance on their contractual payment, which we should pay, and we need another Shs 87 billion if we are going to have any single ID out of this. I believe no one in the Executive knew this because if they had known, they would not have signed such a hopeless contract. (Member timed out.)

3.15
MR EDDIE KWIZERA (NRM, Bufumbira County East, Kisoro): I want to commend the committee for the work done. If you look at page 37, they talk of the President’s letter, and there is a tendency for some people to hide behind the President, and we do not know for how long people will continue robbing this country using the President’s letters. I think the President’s letter was advisory. We have not even seen the minutes of the meeting that took place at State House. 

On page 37, the committee made a general observation or recommendation when they say “the Executive.” Here they are blaming all of them; why can’t the committee be specific? It is better that the committee tells us who these members of the Executive are that connived with these thieves. So, on pages 34 and 47, the committee mentions the Executive, even when they know that it is the President and Mr Kirunda. So, why do you put in hon. Moses Ali and others who were not involved?

This project did not have any feasibility study, and so, they could not even determine the cost or timeframe. 

The involvement of Mr Nsambu should not be left hanging. By this time he should be at Police answering these queries.

Another undefined relationship was between the Ministry of Internal Affairs and that of Electoral Commission. These are two different entities and actually, there is no relationship.

We do not know whether this project performed. If it performed, can we have a performance report? And to what level? We do not even see any progress reports. I think that even Government of Uganda should start using its departments effectively. If ESO had done its work and the information had been taken up, this mess would not be there. 

I realise that there is also a problem with Bank of Uganda. I think that it is high time this Parliament came up with an amendment, because you see the Government of Uganda picked money from Bank of Uganda and. This is not different from what happened during the time of the helicopter saga. Money is spent when Parliament has not even appropriated - Government borrows from Bank of Uganda when there are no approvals. 

The involvement of the Germany ambassador should be investigated. I want to see what interest the Germany Ambassador had in going to advance the business interests. Was he here as an agent of Muhlbauer.

We want to also know how much money has so far been spent and when we expect to get the national IDs.

3.18
MR JAMES KABAJO (NRM, Kiboga County East, Kiboga): Mr Speaker, I take this opportunity to thank the committee for a job well done. I concur with all the committee’s recommendations and generally, even for the people who might have been responsible for any losses. I concur that they be brought to book in accordance with the laws of the country.  

Mr Speaker, this project is very important to the country; it is important to the country’s security and the development of information technology plus other subsequent projects, including the National Data Bank. I, therefore, urge the House to support the continuation of this project. If there is need to change some of the players, so be it, but it is very important that we continue with this project. 

We have had cases in this country where other projects have stalled like the case of the Workers’ House. Workers’ House stalled for almost 30 years, but now that it is complete, you can appreciate that it is an asset to the country.  Therefore, even if a child who is starting to walk falls down, it doesn’t give up just because it fell. It continues trying until it eventually starts walking. So, I don’t agree with Members who are suggesting that we abandon the project just because we had put in some money and there have been some failures.  A single failure doesn’t mean that you stop. If business people were working like that, each time they would fail and stop, we wouldn’t be having successful business people. 

I also think that starting this project without adequate financing was a big mistake and it is partly a reflection of the fact that the project was not properly planned. So, some of the failures we are seeing are due to lack of proper planning before the project implementation began.

In addition to that, I heard a Member saying that the President shouldn’t have been involved. I personally don’t have any problem with the President being involved because he is the Chief Executive of the country. As the ICT Committee, we went and met a delegation from South Korea and we were discussing  E-Governance projects in South Korea, which entailed the national ID and other related information systems. South Korea is one of the top most-rated countries in information technology and their President was fully involved in all those projects. But maybe they did better planning than we did.  

3.22
MS RONAH NINSIIMA (Independent, Woman Representative, Kabale): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to pronounce myself on this subject. The Ninth Parliament has been able to set a precedent out there where we are all applauded for steering the fight against corruption. But the people we represent say, “Thank you for fighting this vice, but how is it helping us when the culprits involved go without bringing back what was stolen?”

For the short time that I have been in this House, I realise that there is a lot that we are yet to see beyond what is here. But we need to move a step forward and see how we can recover some of these funds so that they can be put to their rightful use and the people may be able to see us as people that are focused and willing to fight for them to ensure that they get what they are entitled to, especially these IDs that are very critical to our masses. 

I would like to assure this House that once a President of a nation doesn’t take the lead against corruption - we are half way the journey we are taking. We need to look at the President as not just coming to give direction over how issues should be handled, but to see him taking the lead in fighting corruption. 

I am hesitant to blame the PS and the others that may be involved here with the continuous involvement of the President, because when I put myself in their shoes, I imagine the kind of stamina I would need in order to resist the President’s directive and I cannot find it. It is, therefore, important that the President of this country joins us in the struggle against corruption because we need a leader with a heart for the people of this nation; a leader who is going to put himself in the shoes of the people he is leading in order to see corruption kicked out of this country. 

Lastly, my view is that all those implicated should straight away be prosecuted –(Member timed out.)

3.26
MR BENSON OBUA OGWAL (UPC, Moroto County, Alebtong): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the committee for a job well done. I stand to support the proposals of the committee. When you look at page 4, the committee has listed at least eight very important purposes which this money was going to serve, but alas! €64 million cannot be properly accounted for. For as long as we pay lip service to corruption, we are going to move in circles. 

In countries where corruption has been stamped out, the corrupt have not been treated with the kind of kid gloves that we see in this country. Think of the South East Asia; if you are found to be corrupt - most of them actually prefer to jump off skyscrapers because the alternative would be far more disgraceful and so they prefer to commit suicide. Even in neighbouring Rwanda, where I have been not too long ago, corruption is treated with ferocity. But when you come back to Uganda, the corrupt go free; actually, we glorify corruption. So, let us start to see some movements in the effort to fight corruption. 

I have found so many names of people who have been labelled corrupt in this particular report. If we do not see any action, then we are going to just move in circles, which I have already mentioned here.  

As I sat down here, I thought through the African Writers Series titles and particularly thought of, No Longer at Ease and Arrow of God; it is already facing us. I have thought of Things Fall Apart; the country is falling apart. I thought of Betrayal in the City; we have been betrayed in this city. Mr Speaker, we need some movement to fight corruption. I thank you. (Applause)

3.29
MR GILBERT OLANYA (Independent, Kilak County, Amuru):  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Allow me join my colleagues in thanking the committee for the good work done. When the government came with the idea of providing identity cards to all the citizens of Uganda, I was very happy. You know my district borders Southern Sudan, and when my people cross the border to run their small businesses, they are normally asked for identification. You know our brothers who are there are quite rough compared to this side; if they find anybody moving on that side they ask you, “where is your identity card?” Therefore, when the government came up with the idea, I was very happy and confident that my people would run their businesses without interference.

Mr Speaker, I was very disturbed when I heard that the process of providing the identity cards has been jeopardised by some corrupt people. Let the Ninth Parliament be the turning point for corrupt officials. I would like to thank the committee for the good work they have done. Let us expose each and every corrupt official in this country. Let us squeeze their necks until they vomit whatsoever they swallowed. The unfortunate part of it is that when we are squeezing their necks -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member for Kilak, if you squeeze somebody’s neck do they really vomit? (Laughter) Or it is if you push your hand into their mouth?

MR OLANYA: Mr Speaker, let us get up and make sure that they stand responsible for whatever they have done. In the process of doing so, we need to investigate all the properties they have. Now the corrupt are very wise; wherever he or she has acquired a property, he will register it in the name of the son or daughter. Therefore, I feel that in order to deal with them well, we need to investigate the whole family. You find a son who has just completed senior 4 owns a very big building and you do not know where the person got the money from.

Let the Ninth Parliament be the turning point for all the corrupt. Let us expose them so that the future leaders will come and walk on a clear path. I thank you, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The honourable member for Usuk.

MR MICHAEL OROMAIT (Independent, Usuk County, Katakwi): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. My names are Oromait Michael, Member of Parliament Usuk County-

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The rules allow me to call you by your constituency.

MR OROMAIT: This is for the benefit of others who do not know my name. Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to contribute on the topic. First of all, I would like to thank the committee for the work well done. I would like to urge my distinguished parliamentarians of the Ninth Parliament to continue the war against corruption.

I would also like to thank the President for spearheading and encouraging this Parliament to fight against corruption. The President has never sheltered any corrupt person here. We have so many ministers who were advised to resign because they were implicated on corruption and they are now on the back bench. It is true! Where is hon. Kabakumba? (Laughter) Has hon. Muhwezi been appointed a minister? How about my brother, hon. Mukula? They are all languishing behind there. (Laughter) This is a spirit-

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, there is no corner of this House, no space in this House, no seat in this House that can be referred to as an area for languishing. (Laughter) Kindly, withdraw the word “languishing”. You cannot languish in the House. This is an honourable House.

MR OROMAIT: Mr Speaker, I would like to withdraw. I meant to say that they are seated behind. (Laughter)

So, it is the technocrats who are performing the work for this nation that are stealing from it. Why are they doing this? Why are you looting this country? I am encouraging my fellow members of the Ninth Parliament to amend the Anti-Corruption Bill so that we tighten the noose on these people who are robbing this country. 

How far has Basajjabalaba gone in returning the money which he stole, and where is he? Bring him here to answer. We want to see that these people who have been implicated in this report are brought to book. They should refund the money, which belongs to this country. We are not going to beat about the bush, blaming the people who are not - (Interruption)

MR SSASAGA: Thank you for giving way. The information I want to give my brother from Usuk is that as we put up a fight against corruption and ask Basajjabalaba and others to account, we as Members of Parliament must also desist from conflict of interest, which brings out corrupt tendencies. 

When you go to page 22, my brother and colleague, hon. Mawanda, MP Igara East, is mentioned. His company had the interest of taking up the ID project. I believe that as Members of Parliament, we cannot do the oversight role and at the same time get involved in this. The information I would like to give to the member and to the House, therefore, is that it would be proper if hon. Mawanda came -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: On what point did you rise, honourable member?

MR SSASAGA: Mr Speaker, it was on information.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: You are still giving information, honourable?

MR SSASAGA: Yes, I am still giving information. As I conclude, our brother, Mawanda, who is a member of this House, which is fighting corruption, should come and give a statement on this so that he clears his name concerning this because he has been mentioned.  Thank you very much.

3.38
MR JOHN-KEN LUKYAMUZI (CP, Rubaga Division South, Kampala): Mr Speaker, I would like to congratulate the committee for producing a notable report. After reading the letter by the President dated 13 February 2010, I smell a rat. The President had the following to say: “I demanded to know whether they had succeeded in capturing people’s pictures and fingerprints.” How can a whole President of a country bother to know the details of the printing on those cards when he has very many people? That is suspicious.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Ken-Lukyamuzi, as president of a political party, you don’t want to know that?

MR KEN-LUKYAMUZI: No, a whole President of the country!

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I thought you were a president in waiting also.

MR KEN-LUKYAMUZI: I am talking about the President of Uganda. I could also take my own turn at a different moment, but in regard to the letter written by the President, that letter was so committing. In law, a written word is commitment. He used to hold meetings. He can solicit and give advice orally but once you go to the extent of writing - a whole president - to know the details of the printing of the cards, it means you can as well seek to know whether proof-reading has been done. 

This is a very important point and I am concerned about the President. Why should the President be involved in every saga of procurement? The saga of bicycles, the saga of Owino Market; what about that? Where is this country going? If I became president, I would not bother to know all the details of what is going on. (Laughter)

Mr Speaker, if the beginning of the printing of these cards has been satanic, then there is a problem. It means even the purpose the cards was meant for could breed suspicion. Why am I saying so? I would like to propose that this matter be taken seriously because the cards were meant to work as voters’ cards. Uganda is one of the countries in Africa which has had very many cases of vote rigging and voter bribery. 

Therefore, I propose, in my capacity as President of the Conservative Party, knowing that the Conservative Party attaches a lot of importance to citizenship and its identity, that after going through this saga, we should not begin using those cards until Article 11 of the Constitution is amended. The Article says that any child below five years found loitering around is assumed to be a Ugandan by birth. What a calamity! (Laughter) (Member timed out.)

3.41
MS FLORENCE EKWAU (FDC, Woman Representative, Kaberamaido): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. This House owes the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs applause. We thank you very much. I think the myth will definitely and progressively fade. You brought a report that will stand unchallenged and will stand the test of time, and will be a point of reference. So, thanks for the good work done so far. 

I generate my concern from page 3 by questioning the use of the National Planning Authority. I think the institutions of this country should help to advise Government. We have information calling this by four different names. You begin with Ministry of Internal Affairs calling it National Bio Databank; Ministry of Finance will call it National Population Databank; Ministry of Information will call it National Identity Card Project; Ministry of Security will call it National Security Information System. In each case, taxpayers’ hard-earned money is lost. Where do we have institutions of Government at this point doing away with duplication and advising Government so that we have one well-coordinated body? Where, in this case, is the National Planning Authority? If we are running a country and we are planning activities, you should not have these horrible cases of duplication. 

Imagine in each case funds are lost and you have one activity called four different names, what a shame to this country. One would say “cry the beloved country” indeed. In this age of computers and the information technology that we have, I think someone owes this country an apology for such lack of planning and lack of coordination, moreover in a case where we have the structures in place. 

Secondly, I want to advise the President that next time there are appointments, the first issue to be concerned about is the issue of personal integrity.  If your name has surfaced once in any scandal, the President should save himself from the shame around corruption cases. (Applause) Some of these names keep reappearing. We remember the case when the Rt hon. Third Deputy Premier then was a minister in his department and he was implicated in cases of misappropriating funds for fuel. This is the same minister who resurfaces in another coat sown with another cloth in a different ministry, and this time - (Member timed out.)

MR RICHARD TODWONG (NRM, Nwoya County, Nwoya): Thank you, Mr Speaker. This report is yet another report that we shall always keep lamenting over. It is embarrassing that every time we sit and every time a committee of Parliament submits a report to this House, there are always issues of corruption. I ask myself: is the country officially corrupt? (Laughter) Right from the districts to municipal councils, to the ministries, all Government contracts have problems. To get a letter from the LC, you have to pay for it. To get a job, you have to either know someone or pay for it. 

It concerns me deeply because as a generation, we are wondering whether the future we are going to inherit is a mortgaged future. What debt do we have? Everything is wrong with this contract, according to the report. Yesterday my colleague, hon. Alaso, said it openly - for every contract that has been messed up, there is always a misinterpreted presidential directive. For every contract that has been messed up, there is always a legal mistake by the legal department of Government. For every contact that has been messed up, there is always a problem with the PPDA policy that has not been followed. 

Mr Speaker, I feel very concerned because everything nasty seems to be going around the former Attorney-General. I wonder what was within those chambers under his leadership. I would request that Government takes special interest and properly, technically and specifically, investigates the former Attorney-General.  

Mr Speaker, I also request to know how many foreign contracts we have signed. If Parliament can have the list and the records of all these contracts that have been signed in foreign currencies – For this contract, in particular, because of the inflation and changes in exchange rate, we are going to pay more money. We have loans that we have negotiated for; all these loans are suspicious now. The terms and conditions that we have signed - (Member timed out.)

3.49
COL (RTD) FRED MWESIGYE (NRM, Nyabushozi County, Kiruhura): Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the committee for a job well done but also add that the Parliament, the Executive, especially the President, and the population are concerned about this contract-thieving by people in responsible positions.

There is evidence in the State of the Nation Address by the President on page 16, where he says, “There are two other factors I need to talk about; these are sabotage or delay of vital projects as well as corruption and selfishness”. Therefore, it is not correct to say that the President is not concerned about what is going on.

It is the duty of the President as head of state and as a fountain of honour to give direction and guidance on how matters should be run in the country. Therefore, when he is giving direction in writing, he is emphasising. However, the problem which has been pointed out by the various speakers and the committee is that those in places of responsibility normally do not follow his directives and they should be held responsible. Therefore, I think and I believe it is right to be involved in matters of managing this country because he is obligated by the Constitution.

It is right that this country should have identity cards. I therefore urge Parliament to urge the Minister of Finance to find funds to carry out this project to its logical conclusion. Otherwise, we cannot allow to be left behind by other countries in East Africa as non-identifiable citizens. It is absurd because we cannot track criminals and we cannot track illegal immigrants in this country; anybody comes into this country and enters anyhow. I am sure we can support this project but punish those who culpable. Let us carry out this project. It is important for any country to have a registrar of births, deaths, marriages and even professional skills. (Member timed out.)

MS SARAH NYIRABASHITSI (NRM, Woman Representative, Kisoro): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the committee for the good work done. I would really want to appreciate that this is work that already started and should continue unless we really do not want the IDs. 

When it comes to districts bordering other countries, we face a serious problem especially some areas where we speak almost the same language. You find that somebody is arrested in Uganda and he is a Ugandan but they tell them they entered Uganda illegally yet actually, they are Ugandans. I come from Kisoro and we speak almost the same language like the Rwandese, so I really feel that this project should continue. They should fund it and it continues.

Secondly, I would request that they really carry out a complete financial audit. There might be very many things that are hidden down there that have not come out. I feel that the committee was not given enough time. I feel there are more things that are hidden behind there. 

I feel that right from the beginning, when they were carrying out this project it failed because I see there was no feasibility study that was carried out. There was no proper design for the project. I think the technical officers must be held liable because if there is no feasibility study, I feel that you cannot even guide the President on what you are doing. Thank you very much.

3.54
MS NAOME KABASHARIRA (NRM, Woman Representative, Ntungamo): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I also thank the committee for the work well done. I come from a district which neighbours Rwanda and our people cross freely, but at times they get difficulties because in Rwanda they have what they call “indangamuntu”, that is their national identity card. The other day the locals asked me, “Why can’t Uganda give us also the indangamuntu?” I had no words because I had known there was some investigation concerning the identity cards. 

People have talked of corruption and corruption. I said one time here that we shall lament until we lament no more. I think it is high time we thought of some stringent measures that can make people fear that corruption is a sin. One time, a Member of Parliament in the NRC stood here and mentioned something that made the whole country alert. People were defiling young children and she said that for it to stop, those who do it should be castrated, and people took it as a joke and laughed it off. 

I want to borrow that. We should think of something that is of that nature to those people who steal Government funds. (Interjections) Women do not steal, if you follow the recommendations, if you follow those people whom they asked. I know there are women in those ministries, there are women in Attorney-General’s chambers but you do not see a name of a woman. Let the chairman challenge me. They are men. So, let us follow that and maybe corruption will stop.

We are now lamenting. A member mentioned that we started this session fighting corruption. We are yet to be done, because I know there is a committee which is handling Umeme and it is the same thing. We shall still come here and lament and we do not get anything out of it. For how long shall we continue lamenting? I want some stringent measures, and therefore, I propose that the technical audit be put in place and that a recommendation be added for two weeks to audit that equipment that is lying in Entebbe.

MR PETER OGWANG (NRM, Youth Representative, Eastern): Mr Speaker and honourable members, I have been in Parliament for one year and I have witnessed the loss of Shs 369 billion. Now, within the next five years I am to be here, it implies that if per year we are losing Shs 369 billion, where are we going? 

I want us to get serious here, and I think as Members of Parliament we need to define our roles which are defined in the Constitution. Honourable colleagues, if we have seen a lacuna in the laws of this country, I think we should move to cover up those gaps. We need to amend the Constitution in line with issues of fighting corruption. The law is weak. We pick people here - for instance, I asked a question as to where the PS of Ministry of Local Government is today. Is he not at his home? But a young person who must have stolen even Shs 500,000 is rotting in Luzira. Let us be honest. Where is the country going?

If you look at page 15 of this report, it is very clear. Despite the cautions by the authority for the PS to adhere to PPDA procedures, he adamantly deviated from the law and even had the audacity to dismiss PPDA. What then are we doing here? To be fair, what are we doing here? If the PS can totally ignore the law, then why should we say that we are following the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda? Let us be honest.

Let us ask ourselves, what is that PS still doing in the Ministry of Internal Affairs now? I want to ask Government: up to now, when we are debating this issue, do you still want to know that you have not looked at the issues which have come up from here, that that PS should remain there still working in his capacity as a PS of Ministry of Internal Affairs? 

Honourable colleagues, as we continue debating, can we first resolve that the PS of Ministry of Internal Affairs be interdicted immediately. That should be point blank. He must leave office now before even investigations commence. I also have a problem there. We send these people for investigations and they are cleared. Really, where will they be? It goes back to the question of hon. Todwong - as a country, have we unanimously accepted that we are all corrupt? (Member timed out.)

MRS MONICAH AMODING (NRM, Youth Representative): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would also like to join my colleagues in thanking the committee for coming up with a very expository report. I think it is one of the milestones which we can count as the Ninth Parliament once again in terms of our efforts to work against the corrupt gangsters in this country. I just have two observations. It has already been noted that this project was paramount to this country, and of course, in terms of its importance, it was going to give every Ugandan a national identity. 

The second issue I want to note is that the amount of money which we are talking about here would, for me as a National Female Youth MP, be sufficient to vaccinate all the female children in this country against cervical cancer. Such money can solve a generational problem once. However, here we are talking about a few individuals, a few gangsters who just swindle, choose to thrive on money which our people should be helped with. I think this is a very bad thing in our country. We are standing here tall as youth Members of Parliament and saying this is a legacy which has to change. 

As a country, we cannot proceed this way. As the custodian of the young people in this country, we are saying this has to stop. We want to send a very strong message to the fountain of honour of this country. We are saying the young people of this country do not want to inherit a country which is already mortgaged, a country which is very sick, a country which is about to die. 

We have a lot of anger because when we are out there, they are saying, “What are you doing you young Parliamentarians?” This is something which we are inheriting from the previous leadership, and I want to challenge the senior Members of Parliament and ministers here. A Member of Parliament like hon. Kivejinja is supposed to be retiring to babysit his grandchildren in a very peaceful way, but see how he is going to end. Hon. Alintuma, oh, let God have mercy on Alintuma because I do not want to go there -(Laughter)- but hon. Kivejinja should be retiring in peace as a senior citizen and we go to visit him in Busoga seeking for counsel. But honestly, how can I, Amoding, walk to Kivejinja for counsel? Which kind of counsel will take our country forward? 

We do not want senior leaders to pass on a very wrong attitude to our young people in this country because 20 years from now, what is the country talking about? We want to recommend that as the Ninth Parliament, again we are at a turning point and we want to say, please, give us a better future. Give those people who are younger than us a better future. Let us not only be taking them to court. Let there be some other stringent measures. Some cases of China are coming up although I think that is too much. I think they have to recover - (Member timed out.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, after the speech from the member representing young people, let us acknowledge in the gallery this afternoon young people, pupils and teachers of Covenant Primary School from Mbale Municipality represented by hon. Wamanga-Wamai. They have come to observe the proceedings. Please, join me in welcoming them. You are welcome.

MS ANIFA KAWOOYA (NRM, Woman Representative, Ssembabule): Thank you, Mr Speaker, I want to thank the committee for a report which has attracted serious debate, which cuts across political lines. This afternoon you observed that what walks like a duck, thinks like a duck, sits like a duck is definitely a duck. My question is one; when you see us on this side and you look at our faces and the way we are debating, we are not happy, and you can tell that there is something wrong within this Government. (Applause)

I was here in the Eighth Parliament with my other colleagues. The issue of this ID project was brought on the Floor of this House and was debated. Issues were raised, irregularities were raised; I cannot see why the government cannot use its God-given sense of smell. They should have smelt that there was a rat in this project from the day it began. (Interjections) Why? From the onset of this project, we debated, we referred it back and we are here debating. 

The machines were brought. You can imagine when I went to check on my own card, the record showed that I am born in Amudat; me, Anifa - (Laughter) – Amudat! They asked for my residence and I said Ntinda; constituency, Ssembabule. All the information was mixed up. 

I think Parliament must do something. We should not continue just doing a post-mortem. At what stage should Parliament come in before these Government projects take off? All the people who were involved from the onset – the person who gave the concept to whoever bought it - what did they have in mind?  There was no feasibility study. (Interjections) Hiding on what? What we are only told is that there was political influence, political interference, political directive, political responsibility at every level after things have gone bad. We are not going to continue like that. (Applause) We are not! 

I was convinced, Mr Speaker, when you saw me stand up, that maybe we should amend our rules which we have just amended to have a committee in charge of criminal investigations and prosecution. (Laughter) (Member timed out.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, yesterday I made a communication on the Rules of Procedure as they stand. The Speaker is speaking right now and those of you who are still beating the chairs are demonstrating that you were not here yesterday. Yesterday, I communicated the rules. The rules prohibit us from even clapping, which is more decent than beating the chair. I have seen members continue to pound the chairs. The rules provide for a dignified way of cheering members by hitting at the bottom wood on your seat. You do not stand up and start beating the table, beating the chair; that is not dignified.         

The rules also require you to come in this House in shoes to enable you make that sound. (Laughter) So, please, if you continue in this undignified manner of beating the chair, I will rule you out of order.

MR WILLIAM KWEMARA (NRM, Kyaka county, Kyegegwa): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Like the rest of my honourable colleagues, I want to thank the committee for the work well done. However, I would like to express concern about what I have decided to coin as “executive corruption”. I want to implore the committee to think outside the box like I have done, to know that all that was done was possibly deliberate. I am pessimistic about the future of this project simply because today, there are new forms of corruption which are more sophisticated. I want to explain two and talk about the characteristics of these two forms of corruption.

There is what we call “looting”. This is a new term in corruption now whereby the bureaucrats create a project and then funds are released but at the back of their mind, they know that it is not their intention to have that project completed. I am afraid the ID project could have been one of them. There is a very good example, the LC bicycle scandal. When you study it very well, you see that the intention was not for the project to be completed. It is a new form of corruption which is also manifested in this project.

Then there is what we call “grand corruption”. In grand corruption, the bureaucrats start a project but create all the conditions to get pecuniary advantage. One of such conditions is ambiguity. They take advantage of ambiguity in the law or possibly even create the ambiguity. If you look at the different interpretations or misinterpretations of the President’s letter, it is one characteristic of creating ambiguity so that they can take advantage of it.

Then, also, there is discretion. When we go back to the Basajjabalaba case, you find that the Attorney-General chose to make decisions on his own; that is discretion, which is a precursor to corruption. When you transpose all those, you find that they closely fit in this ID project. 

Also, there is a tendency to rush the project on account that it is classified procurement. So, I am afraid and I am pessimistic that this project or whatever was done was premeditated.

Mr Speaker, looting as a form of corruption, grand corruption as a form of corruption – (Member timed out.)

REV. PETER BAKALUBA MUKASA (NRM, Mukono County South, Mukono): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I also join the rest of the members to thank the members of the committee for this wonderful work and presentation. We should also admit that this committee was somehow polite while handling some figures. We should also admit that the President made a very big mistake in this country while handling this matter. 

I have been in this Parliament for quite some time. This process of identity cards started way back in 2004. A number of companies put in their bids - about 20 – and they zeroed down to about three which were shortlisted. I remember we had Fontek Global, Face Technologies – they even put in their cost. At a later stage, these two could not move on and the President had time in State House to hold a reconciliation meeting with these two companies to see how they could forge a way forward. It had been discovered that some of the members in the President Museveni’s family, relatives, friends and others were involved in this dubious deal and these contracts could not move on. 

It is very absurd to see that right now the President forgot all they had gone through including the reconciliation process and handpicked Muhlbauer again. It hurts to read his letter: “...the German Ambassador brought me somebody called Muhlbauer. This gentleman is not just a trader in identification products. He is, actually, a maker of the machines that capture people’s pictures...” When you actually analyse these statements, philosophically and theologically – (Laughter) - what do they imply? Imagine, if you are a minister of a subordinate receiving this kind of letter? This was a direct command from President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni! 

He goes ahead to say: “I, therefore, have to conclude this matter by requesting you and the Minister of Finance to look at this group with a view to using single sourcing...” He actually introduced the idea of single sourcing. What do you do if the fountain of honour proposed this to you? What could hon. Khiddu Makubuya and the rest of the members really do? This time, as a Christian, President Museveni should come up and confess. (Member timed out.)

MR MARTIN DRITO (NRM, Madi-Okollo County, Arua): Thank you, Mr Speaker and honourable members. What is most important in a deal normally is not the overtones but the undertones. There are fundamental clauses in this deal. One, the PPDA law was totally neglected and the advisory role that the President tried to play in this deal was totally abused.

Mr Speaker, in this country we have had two big companies, a German company, which is 160 years old, and a British Company which is 200 years old. These are the two companies which have been doing business with Uganda in the security printing industry since the time of Independence. Without having to name these companies, I would like to pose a fundamental question: if the German Ambassador was really interested in this deal, how come he fronted a company with very little experience of 31 years as opposed to a German company with a very reputable background of 160 years? The failure by the technocrats to do due diligence on this company, Muhlbauer, with zero experience, is one of the reasons why we have incurred this massive loss. 

Mr Speaker, I wish to take the officials responsible - the PS, the former minister and former Prime Minister - to task. In 2010 when this contract was signed, the Euro Bank offered a rate of 0.391 percent. That is the rate at which penalties were paid as far as interest is concerned. How come this country could commit itself to an interest rate of 1.5 percent per month, meaning a 300 percent increment on the normal interest rate that should be charged? In the process, this country, on each unpaid bill, is paying Shs 11.5 million plus per month, yet the figure should have been about Shs 2.8 million. Finally - (Member timed out.)

DR KENNETH OMONA (NRM, Kaberamaido County, Kaberamaido): I stand to support the report of this committee and also condemn corruption with the strongest contempt that it deserves. A post-mortem is already done in this case and I do not want to waste more time doing a post-mortem. 

What we need to learn from this is that those who are responsible should be apprehended and also indeed, a report like this will also help us to learn how to prevent corruption. Corruption has been commonly defined as abuse of public power for personal gain, but it also includes bribery, kickbacks, extortion, graft, embezzlement, fraud, nepotism, voter bribery among many others. 

I think that it is important that other than fighting corruption, we must also create an environment where corruption is prevented. We must create a country where there is a value  system. It is important for us to understand that we also as leaders must take a lead in creating a corrupt-free environment.

Other than fighting corruption, we must also prevent corruption. If a bribe is corruption and many elected leaders bribe their way into positions, including into Parliament here where they also talk about corruption, then where are we, Mr Speaker?

As elected leaders, we must also take a lead in preaching against corruption at all levels of society. We must also help our community in understanding what corruption is. People buy votes to get to this House and it has even now gone to a very bad extent that in primary schools, people bribe to be elected prefects and we are here talking about corruption. I think preventing corruption will save us a lot more than the fight against corruption. It will begin with you and I at Parliament. We should preach a corrupt-free environment.

I wonder when we will have huge billboards erected at strategic points where names of corrupt people are freely written. I am looking for a time when we shall write the names of the corrupt people in public toilets, where we shall pin the names in churches, print them on dining tables, hang them in such places. It is important for us to try as much as possible to see how we can fight corruption at the primary levels and indeed –(Member timed out.)

MRS JOY ONGOM (Independent, Woman Representative, Lira): I thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs for the work well done. I do not know what I should say but corruption in this country is eating us up and we should do something about it.

In most cases, when we are discussing issues of corruption and when people are named in some of these issues, you will find that at the end of it all, it is the technocrats that suffer. I have this question: what is the role of these ministers that are put in these ministries to oversee their ministries? What do they do? In most cases there are correspondences; what do they have to say when these messages are going on? 

When we are always burying our dead, we do not preach to the dead but to the living. It is my appeal to the ministers that you have a great role to play in the ministries – (Interjections) - They are saying the shadow ministers inclusive - (Laughter) – but I am saying you are government ministers and you have a great role to play. The other time during the bicycle scandal, the technocrats suffered. In UBC, the technocrats suffered. In this national ID, I know that our ministers are going to go scot-free. What is their role? It is not long before we throw a vote of no confidence in some of you. We are tired as women of Uganda. We are tired, and I am again declaring that as women of Uganda we are tired. Please, wake up and play your role.

I do not know, but I think that at an appropriate time the President of the Republic of Uganda should wake up. On many occasions, once he writes a letter to some of these ministers they misinterpret his letters. Soon we are going to have this same flow in the issue of PRDP. Recently, the President wrote to the minister about the Shs 20 billion to be set aside to pay some people in the North, but we have realised that they messed it up because 4,000 people benefited from Shs 20 billion. It is too much for us.

In his letter, the President stated that PPDA be consulted about getting a no objection to single sourcing in line with the provision of that law. Mr Speaker, if we so –(Member timed out.)

MR STEPHEN OCHOLA (FDC, Serere County, Serere): I thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I want to join my colleagues in appreciating the work of the committee for doing a good job. This project was a very good one. You realise that in our country, when we get very dangerous accidents on our roads and we lose friends and relatives, the bodies are not identified just because our citizens do not move with identification, they do not have identity cards. When this project was started, I was one of those people who were always saying our people can now have national identification and this will reduce on bodies being abandoned in the mortuaries in this country. I am very disappointed with what has happened. 

In this country, the one thing I have realised is that the institutions are not performing. We have not allowed the institutions to perform their duties. There is a lot of interference. You find that many mistakes are committed because of the political interference in our institutions. We have not allowed our institutions to operate normally.

Mr Speaker, when you read Annex 3, which is a letter written by the Permanent Secretary to the Executive Director of PPDA, you realise that it says that if the authority had not been given that week we would have been in serious trouble. The letter reads in parts, “Please, as a matter of urgency consider this request”. I have had the opportunity to be an appointing authority at the district level and my interpretation of this letter is that there was a lot of pressure on the part of the technical people. 

In many cases, we have always said that the Permanent Secretary should take responsibility and we have them fired from office. That is just a small fish; the big fish is somewhere hiding. It is high time we went for the big fish. Ministers and the President must now take responsibility, and in this particular one there is no way he can run away. 

I am saying this because apart from the letters where he is always very careful, nobody has given us the minutes of the meetings they had in State House for us to know what was said there. There is also need to know what was said during the telephone calls. You might find that while in the letters he wrote this and that, in the meetings - You know when the appointing authority talks, nobody can question his directive. I know for sure that if the President called some of our colleagues here and asked them to change this and that, they would do it. (Member timed out.)

4.31
MR MATHIAS MPUUGA (Independent, Masaka Municipality, Masaka): Mr Speaker, I thank you. I join colleagues in thanking the committee for authoring this courageous report. I will restrict myself to the contract, the institutions and the characters involved in this whole saga.

On the contract and institutions, we were duly informed that the institution of the External Security Organisation (ESO) was tasked to provide background information on the company. At the end of the day, we witness a minister moving, on behalf of Government, with an inconsequential team of people to negotiate Government business. To us, this puts into question the character of this institution and the nature of the individuals involved therein.

Secondly, one reason why this project was taken up in haste, especially the procurement bit of it, was because at some stage it was considered a very serious national security matter. As such, it was cleared to be undertaken without competition. However, this makes me wonder. The Commander-in-Chief, after detecting a very serious national security matter, gave guidance but went to sleep. Now we are here lamenting about this great swindle.

Without delving into the barriers that divide us as Members of Parliament from the different sides of political thinking, I am wondering as to why we should not hold the President personally and politically liable for this swindle. I know the mention of the word “President” sends a shiver down the spines of some of the colleagues here, but I think at some stage we need to do justice to this country and especially to posterity, if we have to clean the mess that has become of this country.

On page 29, the committee rightly observes that the Ministry of Finance refused to appear before it. The word is “refused”, and they recommended that the Ministry of Finance ensures it finances – Really, Mr Speaker – (Member timed out.)

MS BEATRICE ANYWAR ATIM (FDC, Woman Representative, Kitgum): Mr Speaker, I thank the committee for the work well done. What is at stake in this case are the following: the health sector; mothers in this country will continue to die while giving birth, our children will continue to nod without help, and our medical personnel will continue to also nod with empty pockets because they are not motivated. Our teachers are not motivated because we have not increased their salaries. That means our children are not going to receive quality education. This is likely to affect the levels and quality of education in this country for the new and future human resource. What I am saying is that the economy at large will be at stake because the tax administration will not be realised. Also, the electoral process has led to some elections bringing on board questionable leaders. This puts the country into a state of emergency.

As I contribute to this topic, I am really missing my colleague, hon. Hussein Kyanjo, who has been very pertinent about this issue. How I wish he was here to give his submission. 

Mr Speaker, we have said a lot about these issues. Today, I am very happy that we are now talking at the same pace with my friend, hon. Anifa Kawooya. Please, let us keep this up. We shall reach somewhere. (Laughter)

The facts about this matter are so glaring that you can see that right from the beginning, the political directive and a hovering hand was at play. (Member timed out.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, it has come to the attention of the Speaker that while some members would like to be listened to, they do not want to listen to others. Once they have contributed, they just leave. I would like to inform you that when you do that, your name will enter the blackest spot of the Speaker’s eye and the Speaker may never be able to see you again. (Laughter)

MR BERNARD ATIKU (FDC, Ayivu County, Arua): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Once again, let me join colleagues in appreciating this report. Straightaway I would like to take members to the annexes, specifically annex 3, which has been written about in paragraph 3, and corroborate it with annex 4. If you closely look at these annexure, you will stand with me and thank the PPDA board. Even after the PS of Ministry of Internal Affairs writing that if authority is not given that week, they would be in serious trouble, the PPDA board rejected all these pleas and stuck to what the law as per the PPDA is supposed to be. 

This takes us to the point where many members have mentioned the name of the President, the fountain of honour. You will clearly believe with me that this was an implementation of a directive from the number one of this country. Honourable members, recently, we read in the papers and saw on TV our beloved Speaker being mentioned as being caught across the borders and detained for about 20 minutes. The reason was that he needed to identify himself and give a reason why he had crossed over, and that is how serious the tool we call an identity card is. As soon as he produced his identity card, he was released and apologies were made and all of us were relieved because to us, that was a serious case. 

When you read the observations on page 26, the committee noted that, “The representative of the Solicitor-General argued that the meeting held at State House under the chairmanship of H.E the President cleared for single sourcing.” (Member timed out)

MR JULIUS MAGANDA (Independence, Samia-Bugwe South, Busia): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I also join my counterparts in appreciating the effort that was made by the committee in coming up with this wonderful report.

I wonder when presidential advice or a presidential directive has ever been objected to by any person. We have on many occasions got reports that come here and there is an assumption that when the President has given a directive, then it is taken. The issue here is that we need to demarcate whether the President has advised or whether the President has given a directive. As much as we know, on the record people have taken the President’s advice as directives, and in most cases that is where we have messed up all the processes that come up even if the intention was in good faith.

The idea of an identification programme was perfect for all Ugandans. I come from the border point of Busia and Kenya, and we have brothers from the other side and we speak the same language. The idea of identity is going to solve a lot of problems that come up with issues concerning people crossing, which cause problems on this side of Uganda.

In Kenya, this is a programme that was implemented 20 years ago. For them, they call it “Kitamburiso.” I do not know how we would have called it in the local language here, but it is something that we would have also taken as an identity for Ugandans in the East African Community. Countries like Rwanda and Burundi have also just come up today and they are already establishing these programmes and they are being implemented. For us in Uganda, we are still lagging behind.

What surprises me most is that when you check on page 34, there is a claim that hon. Alintuma, who was the deputy minister of ICT then, is the one who came up with the programme and that means that there was a lot of interest when he introduced this whole idea to the President and other stakeholders. But where are these people? If it was in any other county, even in Kenya, the moment somebody or a committee like this does an investigation like this, these people would have already left their offices. Here, we still have them in the office. We have the Permanent Secretary in office, we have some people vying for positions of leadership to come here and they are part of the team.

MS MARIAM NALUBEGA (Independent, Woman representative, Butambala): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have stood on this Floor since the Eighth Parliament condemning the corrupt because I know that is the highest degree of showing and exhibiting patriotism in this country. We have spoken enough, what we lack in this country is the commitment of our political head, the President. Yesterday, a colleague quoted Matthew but this is more than prostitution. This corruption is worse than prostitution because a prostitute can only be affected individually but corruption will affect the whole country.

The issue of the national IDs came to our committee in 2009 and we put up a fight for this matter as ICT because we knew that this was going to be the outcome. I remember vividly begging hon. Kivejinja to abandon this project but he assured us that the President has directed that this is a national security matter. Where is the security in this thing? 

This project has had 14 milestones and it was supposed to be completed in 2010. We are now in 2012 and we cannot see any product. The contractors are saying that they have delivered six million virgin cards; where are they? They say that they have issued cards to people; these cards cannot stand any test. If you put them to a test of arithmetic audit, these are not national security cards. They can be printed even at Nasser road and in a minute, you have this ID. 

How much money have we wasted in this? This project was supposed to commence with the construction of a national databank; where is it? We were supposed to have the personalisation data centre; where is it? Where is the data that was captured? Where is it kept? Where is the equipment?

When the President was talking about corruption in his State of Nation Address the other year, he said that he cannot touch the corrupt with a long stick. He had said that we were going to institute a commission to fight corruption. In this current State of the Nation Address, he is now diverting to bringing a law; which law don’t we have in this country to punish the corrupt? We only do not have a law of commitment. 

I would like to warn everybody who is in the struggle fighting the corrupt, that in the process of fighting these monsters we should not become monsters ourselves because we seem to be turning into monsters. We speak what we do not mean and we act differently from what we say. A lot of money has been wasted in many projects. What Ugandans need are services. (Member timed out)

DR SAM OKUONZI (Independent, Vurra County, Arua): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I stand to support this motion and I would like to congratulate the team for having done a very good piece of work. I would as well like to air some concerns about this report and what should have been done plus what could have been improved. 

Before I go into that, let me just say that there are two main questions on my mind which need to be answered by this report: One is, what do we do with this project now that we have gone this far? Now that we have messed up ourselves this far, what do we do? I would like to suggest that we bring this project for overall overview for re-conception, re-design and re-planning. The way it is, it is not sustainable, it is no longer credible, and yet I have not seen such a recommendation in the report.  So, I would like to suggest that it be included that this project be re-designed.
 
Secondly, we need to ensure that the people who are culpable must be seen to be prosecuted. We would not want to let people just get away with the law. Some are no longer in their offices but there are those that are still there who should start by stepping aside. We have had such an experience in the past; those who have done something wrong have been mentioned and they should be able to give way so that investigations can take place. So, I urge those who are still in office to leave their offices and allow the law to take its course so that we can investigate those who have been mentioned. 

There are a number of things that have been mentioned in this report and my colleagues have already commented on them, but let me just highlight where my concerns are. The first one is with the implementation of the presidential directive. I would like to believe that the President had a very good intention of designing and urging that this project be taken forward. So, the directive that he has given is what my concern is about. That directive has been mismanaged, and for the future I would like to suggest that presidential directives be managed in a different way. I am not sure whether there is a committee in Parliament that vets and oversees presidential directives, but I think it would be good for a committee of Parliament to always look through presidential directives of that nature where a lot of money is involved.

MR IBRAHIM SSEMUJJU (FDC, Kyadondo County East, Wakiso): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The committee has done a fair job by lifting some of the suspects and recommending for further investigations. Even where the committee has not been bold enough to make more direct recommendations, it has given us information. I would, therefore, like to thank the committee. (Applause)

We have censored ministers in this institution even before some of us joined it. There are those that the Ninth Parliament has forced to resign. There are those who took leave because of the cases going on in court. There are also those that were asked to step aside. The number comes to about 10. So, for diagnosis, we have done fairly well but we have always prescribed the wrong medicine.   

All these transactions that have gone messy start in State House and there are letters from the President, whether it was the bicycles or award of huge sums of money to Basajjabalaba. I think time has come for this Parliament to say enough is enough. We simply cannot continue mortgaging our country. Maybe the President has good intentions but he is tired, which is human. He simply cannot follow a matter that he classifies as first class security. So, in the end they bring him a report that it was messed up. 

Mr Speaker, I look at hon. Alintuma Nsambu; he is the one who is introducing the company to the President and the following day he is the one leading a technical team to go and verify. Really, those of you have attended the campaigns in Bukoto South-(Laughter) - you just have to see the amount of money he is using preparing porridge for every primary school and going around the constituency distributing money. He is not known to be a very good businessman but he has huge sums of money. 

On page 34 of this report, it says that the company was introduced to the President by the Ambassador and by hon. Alintuma Nsambu. On page 35 he says, “There was no time to follow the tendering/procurement process owing to the desire to use the software, starting with the 2011 general elections...” There are two problems with this; we kept saying that maybe there was a conspiracy to rig elections, but we were reminded that this had to be done because it was going to be waterproof. You can see waterproof here. Maybe they were tightening to have money stolen. 

This Parliament can skin the old hon. Kivejinja, you can skin hon. Alintuma Nsambu, but hasn’t time come for you to ask the right questions? Who sends these people to go and sin, one after another? We shall finish this Cabinet here but corruption will not go away. (Laughter) Who is the greatest beneficiary of corruption in this country? Who does not care; even when recommendations are made by Parliament, he will remind a certain caucus that he is a political chief justice, therefore his decisions are final? (Member timed out)

Mr Speaker, initially I was very sad when we were discussing this but from listening to what our colleagues have said, it is very encouraging particularly this topic and subject, which we are looking at in a bi-partisan manner. This means that we have all put our country first and that is how it should be. We are really encouraged by that.

The biggest challenge for our country in service delivery, good management, good governance and leadership is corruption. We all know this and we lament about it. The 2005 World Bank report put the amount of money our country loses to corruption at about US$ 500 million but it has been growing and growing. Possibly now we are losing over Shs 1 trillion through procurement.

The sad thing is that most of the mega corruption scandals and loss of money is around the presidency. I remember in the 1980s when the President was the Minister of Defence in the then UNLF Government and he was very revolutionary at that time, he criticised the President, who was his boss, that the President had turned State House into a clearing house for proforma invoices. What has he done himself? He has turned State House into a clearing house for bogus contracts.

Whenever we write reports, we do investigations and we fail to prescribe the proper medicine. These reports always fall shy of mentioning the President as being responsible for some of this mess. I think -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Oguttu, are you suggesting that the Office of the Attorney-General no longer clears contracts?

MR WAFULA-OGUTTU: Mr Speaker, I know the Office of the Attorney-General receives directives. Hon. Khiddu Makubuya told the committee several times, the Governor of the Bank of Uganda told a committee several times that they were directed. All ministers say that they have been directed. Therefore, it starts there in State House. I think the President does this in good faith but the problem is once they have got that “okay” from him, they go into overdrive to steal.

This House should ask the President to desist from writing letters directing people on contracts. Corruption will not stop in our country unless the President stops clearing contracts and stops meeting business people who want to supply our country with whatever they want to supply and he gives his officials a directive - (Member timed out)

MR MOHAMED KAWUMA (DP, Entebbe Municipality, Wakiso): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I also stand to pronounce my position on this subject. In the first instance, I want to thank the committee for the explicit report and the recommendations made therein.

Since yesterday when debate on this subject started, I feel we are talking on the same wavelength condemning corruption and seeing how this problem can be addressed. However, I want to remind us of previous similar reports that have come out in this Parliament mentioning areas of corruption, and I will mention a few. We had the jets purchase, monies of NSSF, and remember the Temangalo saga and how it ended. We have the UBC, the bicycle problem, the CHOGM funds; the list is staggeringly long.

What total cure have we given to this problem? Members have mentioned the equivalent services or works that could be done with such monies lost. Remember UBOS failed to undertake a census because there was no money. We have failed to raise salaries of teachers because there is no money and yet there are individuals specifically known that are eating this money.

I want to make suggestions to this House because we are talking on the same wavelength. A few days ago, we learnt of a judgement made by court which subjected one of the persons questioned to a fine of a relatively small amount of money. A person steals Shs 200 million and is then requested to pay a fine of Shs 20 million and she is even happy in court! I think this is unserious.

I want all members to support the proposal in the amendment of the Anti-Corruption Bill that for any person in this country, including the President, who is cited in matters of corruption, a recovery of 100 percent of the monies lost has to be made, otherwise we are going to be debating. How did Temangalo end? I know some members who were even invited to Entebbe and were compensated or rewarded with ministerial positions. We are just going to talk here and then the problem is going to continue on and on. (Member timed out)

MS BETTY AOL (FDC, Woman Representative, Gulu): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Yesterday, I was so disappointed by one Member of Parliament who got up and said, when a woman committed adultery and was taken to Jesus He said, “Whoever thinks that he or she is sinless, throw the first stone.” This was really a wrong quotation brought in, something which is not relevant at all in this case. Really, if you want to quote the Bible, let us do so for the right reason. 

I cry for my beloved country when I see children going to hospital and health centres and are not attended to. One time I went to Palaro Health Centre III and I found panadol being broken into two to be given to the children. That was not a dose. They just had to take half and the other half was to go home with because you have very little, and adults were not attended to.

Today, we are all actually speaking with the same voice. I hope we are going to continue like this. When we handled issues of CHOGM here in this Parliament and members of NRM were called to State House, the next day when all of us were speaking about reproductive and maternal health, there was a complete U-turn. I went to some Members of Parliament and asked, “Are we going to stand firm to make sure that we protect the women of Uganda and make sure that service delivery reaches them and make sure that our women do not die because of bringing new life to Uganda?” Some members told me, and some of them are not here, that “We are not going to cross the Floor. We were told that if you have to oppose then you must cross the Floor.” (Member timed out)

MR VINCENT SSEMPIJJA (Independent, Kalungu County East, Kalungu): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Firstly, I thank the chairman and his committee for a job well done – (Interruptions)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, you can yield the Floor if you have been interrupted unduly and speak tomorrow. 

MR SSEMPIJJA: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I stand on two points. One, to thank the committee and the second one is on the issue of flouting our procedures. One wonders why we put in place institutions and then we disregard them. On page 37, the committee categorically says that the President’s advice was not followed; it says the PPDA was neglected and even their advice not taken; the ESO report was not followed and their advice was not even listened to. There are others of course. So, one wonders why we put in place these institutions which we pay taxpayers’ money. I think one time this Parliament must pronounce itself on flouting procedures and disregarding the institutions that we put in place.

Lastly, when you look at the monies that are involved in these things - My district, Kalungu District, celebrated recently when we passed a budget of Shs 11 billion. When you look at the monies that Basajjabalaba took, Kalungu District would take about 15 years to get that kind of money. (Member timed out)

MR ANDREW BARYAYANGA (Independent, Kabale Municipality, Kabale): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the committee for a report well done. I also want to thank the Ninth Parliament. By the way, I want our children’s children to know that when the Ninth Parliament stood up against corruption, it did not leave any stone unturned. Let it be known that the Ninth Parliament, as far as it is concerned when it comes to zero tolerance of corruption we are there. 

I shudder when I look at the people who are corrupt. They are people of ages 45 and above. These are men and women who believe that money is finite, and for them to make money somebody must lose. In this scenario, the country is the one to lose. 

Recently, I was in my constituency and when I went on radio, everyone was calling in and asking, “What is this that is going on with this ID project? They are telling us that we are going to pay money for IDs when those who got them got them for free.” Indeed, it was very absurd. Rwanda, which just emerged from war recently, has it in the name of Indangamuntu but for us here in Uganda, we do not have a national ID. Where are we heading to? I want to tell you that if we do not stand up and fight this vice, we are doomed. 

Nowadays they even take us for granted. They think that the Ninth Parliament will tell them to step aside and that is all. They must pay back. When the Executive comes back to ask for money, we will not give them the monies they want until these people bring back the monies they have stolen. We are not ready to keep on dilly dallying here and there. We have to stand firm and these people should pay back what they have been stealing.

I want to thank this committee. Thank you very much. Let us keep the spirit high. Let the fight go on. Let the Ninth Parliament be known to fight against corruption for the people of Uganda. Thank you.

5.16
MS BETTY AMONGI (UPC, Oyam County South, Oyam): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I think we need to congratulate this House because it is emerging that on key issues, especially those of corruption, we debate in a non-partisan way. I think we need to congratulate ourselves. (Applause) 

Mr Speaker, I have noted that over the years, as we debate issues of corruption a pattern is emerging where procurement is one of those key mechanisms of swindling resources. Whether it is sourcing or it is procurement through open bidding, it is emerging that procurement is one of those key mechanisms being used to swindle public resources.

Abuse of institutions to cover up corrupt tendencies is also emerging. If you look at this report, they tell ESO to investigate in five days; ESO then brings a report indicating that this company does not have capacity but the ministry continues to use this same company. Why would you go to an institution of Government to investigate if you know you do not want to use the information? Isn’t that to rubberstamp, to try and give credence? 

I also see a pattern emerging where politicians use the name of the President, not only the name of the President but the so called advice. When you read that particular letter - I read it clearly - it says first of all do single sourcing but make comparative analysis, go to Congo Brazzaville. The President also says, “Make sure you consult with the PPDA Act.” But these people ignored that and they continued saying the President has said go for single sourcing. Why are you not reading what the President has said - comparative analysis? You refused to go to Congo Brazzaville. You all selectively said, “The President has said single sourcing” and yet he has said, “in compliance with the PPDA Act.” I think that is why even in public accounts they failed to fault the President.

MS FRANCA AKELLO (FDC, Woman Representative, Agago): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I actually get a lot of comments from the public, which had high hopes for the Ninth Parliament, applauding Parliament for the fight against corruption. Should we make any mistake of condoning corrupt acts, the public has already started speaking that the Ninth Parliament has become a toothless barking dog. That is true. This Parliament must prove beyond doubt that it is not a toothless barking dog by standing by our word.

By the time people in high authority involve themselves into bargaining on behalf of the highest bidder - Tell me, under the sun, I come to offer US$ 150,000, the other one is offering US$ 95,000, the other US$ 30,000 and you are choosing the one who is offering US$ 130,000, which is higher than the others, you must know there are some fishy things happening. I want to request that this Parliament pronounces itself like the committee has recommended, that everybody whose name has been mentioned in this act must be arrested, prosecuted and must vomit the money they have eaten. This must be our stand as a Parliament and we are not yet about to reverse this.

On corruption, if Parliament has stood as one - you can imagine this side of the House and the other side of the House is speaking the same language - we must applaud ourselves for that. I really want to thank the committee so much. In fact, I am making the shortest speech today. 

I want to conclude by requesting the committee also - Anyway, it has now reached Parliament level for approval of all members, but it would have been important for you to include the role of the Inspector General of Government. I have not seen anywhere where the committee has invited the Inspectorate of Government. What is the role of the IGG in this case? We would have got advice from the inspectorate before we would go into all this mess. (Member timed out)

MR KENNETH LUBOGO (Independent, Bulamogi County, Kaliro): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I stand to commend the committee for the work that was done and for the wonderful report that was given to us. In my brief submission, I want to bring out three issues. It was noted in the report that this was classified as a security transaction. I have read pages 4 and 5 of the report to understand why it was necessary to have this project procured. I really find nothing so peculiar that qualifies this project as a security transaction that would otherwise warrant circumvention of the PPDA Act.

For that reason, I would want to get clarification from the government, when you are giving your side of the report, what unique ingredients made this particular project a sensitive security matter that there was necessity to circumvent the PPDA Act. I want to understand that because for me, I do not really see anything that makes it such a unique project; it is not like procuring guns or something like that. 

What I also get from this report is poor planning and a desire to have no regard to the budget of this country. It is stated on page 36 that when this amount of money was conceived, there was no idea of where the money was going to come from. This Shs 200 billion that we are talking about was not budgeted for and we are going for it as a contingency transaction. One wonders, how could a nation fail to budget for a project that is Shs 200 billion and go for it in a hurried manner to try to swindle money from the coffers of the nation.

One honourable member has noted that actually, the President wrote and the President said that “go and follow up this to verify the credibility of the supplier”, but there are contradictions within this report. When you read page 9, it is the President who told that committee that there was no time to follow the PPDA Act. That is the statement made by the President. Now one wonders, how can somebody who has given instructions that “do it in accordance with the PPDA” at the same time speaks and says that there was no time to follow the PPDA? There is a conflict here, something that we need to understand better. 

Today I was reading in the newspapers that hon. Khiddu Makubuya threatened that if he is pushed too hard, he is going to reveal details and expose what hidden agenda was there in State House and the other agencies of Government that are involved -(Member timed out)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, in the gallery this afternoon we have pupils and teachers of Mbogo Primary School from Kawempe North represented by hon. Latif Sebaggala. They have come to observe the business of the House. Please join me in welcoming them. (Applause)

5.26
MS FLAVIA KABAHENDA (NRM, Woman Representative, Kyegegwa): Thank you so much, Mr Speaker. I would like to also appreciate the work that the committee did and also really condemn corruption. I am one of those who cry for the dead but never go with them into the graves. Whoever is culpable in morals stands dead, and if they are investigated let them enter their graves. 

In the recommendations, we have some issues that we do not seem to look at from the way I have been following up the discussions from members. From pages 35 to 37, I see us having an obligation. We entered a contract, we have not paid off. I want this Parliament to pronounce itself on whether or not we are going to pay, and that the Ministry of Finance is ready in the budget that we are yet to pass to provide for the payoff of the remaining amount as per the contract.
 
I observe that even the storage at Entebbe may not be safe because the whole project has no home. Where does it belong anyway? It seems to me we have no home or even a ministry to operationalise issues of this project which were not funded. We do not seem to specify an owner and we do not seem to specify where we must store this equipment. Some of it seems to be getting lost along the way. I do not know between when the audit was made and now if we have not lost even more than we had lost by the time of the report from the audit.

I would like to concur with the committee that we get insurance for the equipment. Although when I see all this, I get even worried about whether we have really got the right equipment. Did UBOS certify the equipment? I do not know. That raises an issue in my mind. (Member timed out)

5.29
MS ANNE AURU (NRM, Woman Representative, Moyo): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the committee for a very good report. The importance of national identity cards cannot be over-emphasised, and right now it is being demonstrated by the very ministry, that is, the Ministry of Internal Affairs; in Moyo District, for the Sudanese who want to come to Kampala there is always a road block and they are stopped. That is a state which got independence only one year ago compared to our own country which is 50 years old. 

I want to support the recommendations of the committee, especially on hon. Kivejinja and the permanent secretary because all advice was given to them but it appears they were just determined - they had vested interests in single sourcing. They should really get that punishment.

I want to propose that a value-for-money audit be carried out first to establish the real loss which we have incurred because in the committee report it says the Electoral Commission received 4,000 kits. Also in the same report, on page 21, it is stated that there is expensive equipment which is stored with UPPC in Entebbe. 

I also wish that the report mentioned all the titles and names of those who are involved in this corrupt issue. The names of some have been mentioned but I would like to observe that a person like the chairperson of PPDA needs to be commended for work well done. She stood her ground despite the many meetings. She even wrote to the minister that single sourcing is not good. In the same vein, I want to commend the chairman Electoral Commission for taking a personal initiative to send three of his staff to go and establish whether those machines, which are to be brought, conform to the required standards.

On John Alintuma Nsambu, who decided to assign false titles to two people with whom he travelled privately - (Member timed out). 

5.39
MR DENIS OBUA (NRM, Ajuri County, Alebtong): Thank you so much, Mr Speaker. I want to commend the committee, and I want to say that I have perused through this report and as a standard practice in this Parliament, I think we are not just a barking dog. It is unfortunate that legally, we have limits. 

I have perused through this report from cover to cover. One fundamental fact which is so critical is that this committee has helped us in establishing a prima facie case against personalities mentioned and implicated in this report. At such a critical point, I think it is incumbent upon Parliament to implore the relevant state organs if there is a will. If there is a will in the other relevant state organs, they must swing into action while using this report as a working document to get those public officers, including politicians who were implicated. 

That same position of establishing a prima facie case is further supported legally by Article 164(2), which I read to this Parliament earlier on. I believe under Article 98(4) and (5) it is only the President who is immune to both civil and criminal prosecution but the rest, while holding office and are implicated, must pay the price for causing this financial loss to the state and to the people of Uganda. 

Mr Speaker, I want to re-echo about two or three strong recommendations which must be taken up. One is that as a Parliament, we have set a precedent and we must continue biting in our own ways. We have set a precedent of not approving some nominees for ministerial positions because of their records. I think we must also strongly recommend that as a Parliament, for some of these people when appointed into public offices, we shall not approve their appointments basing on their records. This must come out clearly. 

Two, we should appeal to the relevant state organs that the time is now for them to swing into action and investigate these personalities further with the ultimate goal of imputing judicial proceedings against them. That is not the end; we want this money to be recovered. (Member timed out)

MS LILLY ADONG (NRM, Woman Representative, Nwoya): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me this opportunity. Surely, the country needs identity cards. If you move through the East African region, it is only Uganda which is still dilly-dallying with getting identification and soon we may get problems. 

The project was well conceived but the implementation, as usual, remained a challenge. We appropriate money to Government departments but when it comes to implementation, that is where we see the real colours of who is a nationalist and who is not. 

I want to ask this question: what role does the President and ministers play in the procurement process? The law is very clear. The technocrats and the board or the contract committees have their own roles to play. Why should they meddle in the procurement of ministries and then leave the country limping and going on with this corruption? Why should the President continue giving these directives yet they are always misinterpreted? Look at the case of the LCs’ bicycles; it was the same, the President was misinterpreted. Basajjabalaba’s case, the President is misinterpreted. Now this issue, the national IDs, the President is misinterpreted. All this yet we keep on losing millions and millions of shillings! When is this directive going to stop? 

Also, I want to urge the corrupt in this country to do us a favour and have the country at heart. It is not only their families. They are not the only people with ambitions in this country. We have women and children in the villages who need this money. We have patients, children, in Northern Uganda dying of the nodding disease. If that money was channelled to it, by now we would have history. 

The nodding disease started in 2009 but this ID project started immediately after that. What I want to say is that if that money was channelled into immunising children against diarrhea and pneumonia, which the poor people cannot afford, we would not have deaths of children. We have these vaccines available but Government cannot afford them but you see the unkind Ugandans swindling this money. 

I, therefore, want to submit that all the people who were implicated should not be spared. Let them answer. Let them go down the drain. We shall not sit, fold our hands and see a few individuals spoil the name of the government, spoil the name of the President and bring suffering to Ugandans. I beg to submit.

MS EMMA BOONA (NRM, Woman Representative, Mbarara): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I wish to thank the committee for presenting a very useful report. However, I would like to add a few comments and observations. From the time we started debate on this report, I can see all of us want the national identity cards, and this House is angry at what happened and killed the project. 

I, therefore, want to propose the following: Even in the NRM manifesto, the policy is zero tolerance to corruption. So I say it is in our hands to improve and make better laws. Uganda is well known for having very good laws written on paper but which we do not apply. Last week, I was at a UN meeting and the issue was corruption. I had to say something about the way we fight corruption in Uganda. All these are well written on paper but do we apply them? We need to show the population that we have recovered monies from people who have swindled the citizen’s money. 

Secondly, we need to amend the laws to hasten investigations concerning corruption. We wait forever, we hear investigations are going on and nothing comes out of them. We wait for one month, six months down the road and the population thinks we are enjoying it. We need to show the population that we are serious by quickly investigating these corruption tendencies. 

Thirdly, we, the Members of Parliament, what are we doing? Are we applying the Whistle Blowers Act we recently passed? There as so many people out there who know a lot of information but have failed to speak because we have not ably shown that we can protect people who report cases. We know, for example, some people who have lost jobs because they whistle blew or because they said things they knew were happening in their departments. What are we doing as lawmakers to protect such people?

May I also inform this House that I was a member of the committee which investigated the bicycles. I would like to say that there was no letter from the President changing any procedure that was happening. The contracts committee committed its errors and it is now answerable. The permanent secretary has been interdicted. I am even surprised that in this report, no interdictions have been recommended. (Member timed out)

5.47
MS HUDA OLERU (NRM, Woman Representative, Yumbe): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity. The committee did what it was supposed to do therefore we thank them for that. It is very difficult to find out what corruption is. Corruption is so ambiguous that getting a solution for it is a very big problem. 

On this ID project, my view is that the people who signed the project did not do their work. Maybe it was intentional so that they would eat the money, or they did not have the skills to analyse the project and come up with a project design. If all the five stages of the project design were followed, I do not think we would be complaining now. 

Mr Speaker, some of the areas where the project design was very poor was on storage. Those who designed the project did not even know the size of the equipment and did not even prepare any space where the equipment would be stored. They did not even ask whether this equipment would be stored centrally or whether they would be taken to the districts where the activities would be done. So when the contractor brought in the project, he was stopped because there was no place to keep the equipment, which was so delicate. That is a problem of project designing and analysis. 

In the committee’s report, they talk about the advice and directive of the President. I have a question which has bothered my mind. The question is: why is it that the directives and advice given by the President on projects like the ID projects, the Basajjabalaba compensation and the bicycle saga are implemented immediately yet his directive on an issue like renovation of Yumbe Hospital has not been implemented for more than three years? Why do they implement some and leave out others? (Member timed out)

MR STEPHEN KAGWERA (NRM, Burahya County Kabarole): Thank you, Mr Speaker. The issue of the national identity card is very vital as shown on page 2. The issue of corruption has been on the Floor of this Parliament for quite long. Some of us were here in the Eighth Parliament and all these recommendations we are making were made on a number of things. I remember the Temangalo saga, CHOGM, the bicycles saga and now the ID project. 

I believe this report is as important as others, but the recommendations we have been making have not been implemented. If there is anything that has been implemented, it is very minimal. So I believe that what is lacking in this country is the political will to fight corruption. Let us put the political will in place to fight corruption and then everything else will be done. 

I remember the other time the IGG commented on someone in the CHOGM scandal, that he had done something wrong. Two days after, they said, “no, this man is very clean”, and the honourable member is now comfortable in Parliament. So, the will to fight corruption is not there. You even saw it yesterday. When the issue of corruption came up yesterday, everyone was up in arms quoting the Rules of Procedure, quoting the Constitution -  you really see someone coming out to fight. I asked myself, “What are these people protecting? That was here in Parliament. 

So I believe we need to sit down as Parliament and see what has gone wrong. Is it the Executive, is it Parliament or is it the Judiciary? These other institutions are lower than those; they are under Parliament, the Judiciary and the Executive. Let us take the three arms of Government and see where we have gone wrong, otherwise you will talk about the Police investigating but someone will call and say, “Please halt”, and they will stop. Do not let us tie the hands of people who are not supposed to be tied. Let us check ourselves.

Parliament has done commendable work, especially the Ninth Parliament, but we are yet to do a lot more because what the citizens of this country need to see is the implementation. We have asked people to step aside and they have done it, but very soon you will see them here. People did it in the Sixth Parliament and immediately they were promoted; those who were state ministers were made full Cabinet ministers. Now these ones you think are stepping aside are busy enjoying the money. Actually, if someone has stolen billions and you tell them to step aside you are giving this person a clear and good exit.

MR GEORGE EKUMA (NRM, Bukedea County, Bukedea): I thank you, Mr Speaker. Mine is to thank the committee for their wisdom. They have shown high levels of being nationalists. I also want to begin by thanking Parliament for talking in that tone, although I still want to see it after this debate when we are voting. How are we going to vote? It is a challenge. On voting day, people disappear and we say that “we are fighting corruption”. 

I want to bring this to my party where I have senior colleagues, ministers and leaders, here. Whenever we go for any caucus meeting or NRM functions, we have always talked about patriotism, nationalism, Pan Africanism, socio-economic transformations as a philosophy of NRM. I now want to ask that since we started preaching this gospel, who has been the convert from the time we came from NRM? If I amass wealth and construct huge flats around Kampala and yet people are dying of nodding disease, are infected with jiggers, hospitals cannot perform well, are we patriotic and nationalistic? These are the issues that we must ask. Whom have we converted from the time we started preaching about our philosophy? (Applause)

When Jesus Christ was preaching on this Earth, He had disciples. The 12 disciples would move with Jesus and they would preach the Gospel according to what Jesus was instructing them. What about the disciples His Excellency has, the ministers; why are we doing what is contrary to the message or principal of our good party, NRM? This is what hurts me most.

I want to thank PPDA. I want to join my colleague who commended PPDA for accepting to stand by their principle that the law states that this type of procurement should not be singly sourced but competed for, looking at the volume of the contract. The committee cited that the contract took only five weeks; it was initiated, the contractor was sourced and in five weeks it was implemented. (Member timed out)

MRS TETE CHELANGAT (NRM, Woman Representative, Bukwo): I thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for giving me this opportunity. I want to join the rest of my colleagues to sincerely thank the committee for the tireless work and labouring very hard to bring out this very comprehensive report. I want to be counted among the few that are fighting corruption in this country. I want that when they open the book of remembrance, my name is there. When I am not in this Parliament, they will know that I was among those fighting corruption. 

As Members of Parliament, we have publically proclaimed that corruption in all its forms is unacceptable. We call on the authorities not to merely condemn it on paper but to take action and prosecute those suspected of practicing it and to punish them if they are found guilty. When senior members of Government are punished for corruption, everybody will know and learn that corruption does not stay in this country. Uganda belongs to all of us and not to those who pocket lots of money, who leave the multitude in this country to suffer. 

I am not comfortable with the recommendation of the committee on page 19 which says that the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development should provide funds for the operationalisation of the project that has stalled at the moment. Mr Speaker, we know where the funds are and the people who messed up the project must vomit the money as other colleagues have said.

In this country, we have watched people embezzle public funds and left unpunished. We have seen the problem of bicycles, vaccines and people have gone unpunished and yet Ugandans are suffering and women are dying. Some of us are crossing through other countries to reach our homes and yet some other people are eating the money and there is no money to construct roads. I am very disappointed and bitter because this exercise that has been messed up affects me and my people. (Member timed out)

MS SARAH NDOBOLI (NRM, Woman Representative, Budaka): Mr Speaker, I want to join my colleagues in thanking the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs for the empowering report that has helped us understand what goes on in our country. 

First and foremost, I feel that as a country, Uganda, we must come up and get clear systems that define different roles and responsibilities which at the same time are well enshrined in our roles and institutions. However, what is happening is that everything is just being overlooked. The report clearly shows us the highest level of irresponsibility at different levels. It is very unbecoming of our political leaders that most of the time they want to cause the breaking of the laws that they should protect.

Secondly, on the side of the technical people, I think we are losing the fibre of the importance of technical competence and support. I wonder how all those senior people could have allowed a project to take off without proper planning, without ensuring where the project was going to be installed. I think this is the highest level of irresponsibility that should not be tolerated. I think that this is a clear sign of connivance that we are not going to tolerate. Whoever is mentioned should take personal responsibility. 

On the side of recommendations, I feel that as a country we have lost. The best we can do is save the little we can. The machines are already here and depreciating and some are being vandalized. I think Ugandans can only benefit when we save where a cost has already been incurred. In that regard, I would like to appeal to my colleagues to continue pursuing the project as we get onto those who have caused the losses. The taxpayer will only continue incurring costs in interest to the company, which might not benefit us.

Finally, I feel the issue of asking Ugandans to pay when people have swindled money is unfair. I do not think they will have any confidence in us as their representatives.

MS RUTH MOLLY LEMATIA (NRM, Woman Representative Maracha): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for allowing me the opportunity to speak to this report. Like other colleagues, I also thank the committee for authoring such a good report.

I notice that we are in a state of panic as Government. When I was coming to this meeting today, I bought a copy of the Red Pepper newspaper in which I read a story quoting a former minister saying “I am going to bring the secrets out.” What are those secrets?

I think we need to revisit the duties of the three arms of Government because there is need for us to know how they relate. When the President appoints these ministers – I have never been a minister - I do not know whether the ministers know that as part of their role they are supposed to advise the President. A person can advise their mother on one or two things, for example. It is not that as a child you have to take whatever your mother gives to you in totality. In that regard, I expect the ministers to advise the President on what may not work well. 

The President is very clear in his letter regarding this matter. I have taken a lot of interest to read the other letters that originate from the President to especially the ministers; he is always very careful in writing such letters. In this particular matter, he said “If it conforms to the Act that is in existence”. Many times I see ministers just panic and they end up acting on such instructions wrongly. That shames us so much. That is why I think we need to revisit our job descriptions or maybe there is need for us to write the job descriptions for our colleagues to help them know how to relate with the head of state.
 
On this issue of the IDs, I would like to say that I was so excited about it because Maracha is at the border of Uganda with the Democratic Republic of Congo. We are actually the people who need these identity cards very much because our colleagues in that country have their identifications, which they use whenever they come to Uganda. Our people face a lot of difficulties when they cross over to the other side. Yes, we are all Lugbara but because we do not carry any identification, they pick us very easily. (Member timed out)

MS FREDA KASE-MUBANDA (NRM, Woman Representative, Masaka): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for giving me this opportunity. I would like to congratulate the chairman of the committee and the members for a report very well done. I also would like to associate myself with those Members of Parliament who are calling for the punishment of those who are guilty of swindling our money. They are actually out there bragging that money is not a problem. Imagine they are doing all this to the poor taxpayers who have been toiling to pay the taxes from which they are swindling. That is very sad.

However, much as I associate myself with those who have said that we have to recover the money that has been swindled, we should also think about some deterrent measures to put corruption to a stop, especially regarding those people planning to become members of this House. I, therefore, would like to recommend that this House drafts a law to bar people who have been convicted of corruption related cases from ever seeking to be members of this House. That will be a deterrent measure to keep them away from such practices if they ever want to come to this House.

Mr Speaker, the last point I would like to make is about the equipment. On page 40 of the report, it is mentioned that the equipment is at Entebbe and that it is only waiting to be commissioned so that the ID project can move on. In that regard, I want to move that we go forward – (Member timed out)

6.08
MS PAULA TURYAHIKAYO (NRM, Rubabo County, Rukungiri): Thank you, Mr Speaker, for this opportunity. I also would like to thank the committee for the report but also go on to join my colleagues in expressing our concerns regarding the implementation of our own policies and law enforcement. I remember that as a country, we agreed to undertake a decentralisation policy. In there it was agreed that ministries should not implement projects. However, I realise that this practice has continued. That is why most ministries are implementing projects, most of which have failed to take off, for example, this particular one on the ID cards. In that regard, allow me to echo my views that ministries should desist from implementing projects because experience has shown that they do not have the capacity to do so.

Secondly, yes, we keep talk about laws, but law enforcement in our country is still such a big challenge. Now we are talking about the equipment that was procured being worth €64 million but as we talk, already 39 laptops, including the supporting systems, were stolen and the case was reported to Police and no follow-up has been made to date. So, Rt Hon. Speaker, I think law enforcement in this country has a serious problem and needs to be looked into.

I appeal to this House that we still need identification for our Ugandan citizens and this project should proceed, but should be well designed and well planned, because we still need to have deaths and births,  as well as marriages registered. 

We need to undertake electronic governance of all the systems and institutions in this country and we can only do this once our citizens have been identified and all systems and procedures put in place. Otherwise, I thank you Rt Hon. Speaker.

6.11
MR MICHAEL AYEPA (NRM, Labwor County, Abim): Thank you Mr Speaker. I thank the committee for this report. I read the State of the Nation Address and saw the budget for the roads and I was wondering how many of these roads would be repaired with Ugshs 2 billion. This Shs 2 billion would tarmac Hoima-Butyaba and Atyaka-Ajumani-Mwoyo-Ofunji; it would tarmac many other roads; it would do a lot for Uganda. So, we have really lost a lot of billions. 

I am a member of an accountability committee. Just last week we met some Members of Parliament from South Africa and they asked us one question: “Can you tell us one example of a case that you handled until you recovered the monies that was stolen by the corrupt in this country?” I got stuck because I had no answer; I started fidgeting around. I handled the bicycle case, but up to now we do not know how much money was recovered. We only know that the permanent secretary stepped aside. Where is the money and how much was recovered? Even this one here, we are going to handle and we say some people should step aside, but we shall not know how much is recovered.

I recommend that a committee should be put in place and we try to recover this money and even lay it on Table such that we know that this money has been recovered and it is here.

There was a guarantee by the German Government; we would also like to know the implication of that guarantee now that we have a loss. We need to have them pay back this money. I recommend that this money is recovered.

I also want to thank the PPDA for standing strong and resisting the pressure. Why didn’t the rest of the officers and ministers resist any pressures, if any? I also recommend that the ministers must be personally liable for the loss they caused this country. 

You can compare this with the CAOs in the district and the pressures from the chairperson and the political wing. Now, if the CAO accepts to go by that pressure, he suffers alone. So, let these officers who are responsible suffer because they are technical people and they should have handled these issues technically. They should stop hiding behind pressure from anybody because these are professional people who know what they are supposed to do.
We need these IDs and they should proceed to be produced. The people should not pay for these IDs because the money is already there. It was stolen, so we should only recover the money and proceed with the project of the ID, and give people IDs free of a charge.

6.14
MR TONNY AYO (NRM, Kwania County, Apac): Thank you Rt Hon. Speaker. As we talk here a lot of money is being stolen and people will continue to steal it right from parishes, call it NAADS, sub-counties, districts and in ministries.

This is happening because the benefit of corruption is much bigger than the punishment which is normally given. And because of that, too many people are stealing money and they live in circulation. They are adored and corruption has become pleasurable because the kind of houses and money they have convinces everybody to go and steal from Government.

I think it is important that this Parliament provides both vaccine and medicine against corruption, because while we celebrate the golden jubilee, if we continue with these tendencies of corruption, if it is not cured then the future of this country will be very bad for our children. 

Mr Speaker, as we propose an amendment in the Anti-Corruption law of confiscating the properties of the corrupt, I think it is time for us to move a step forward and include in the amendment a provision for a minimum punishment of life imprisonment to the corrupt and a maximum of death by hanging. Unless we do that, we cannot reduce the number of the corrupt in circulation, and then it will act as a vaccine and a medicine to scare people. Short of that, after 50 years, corruption will continue.

When I look at this document, the President initiated the idea and provided a guide, but the then Third Deputy Prime Minister   and Minister of Internal Affairs, hon. Kirunda Kivejinja, behaved like a dedicated hyena and went ahead to say that the President had emphasised single-sourcing. Even after he went ahead to threaten the PPDA that within a week if it was not authorised, they were in very serious trouble, the PPDA chairperson insisted that procedure must be followed. As a result these two people caused us this mess. So, if this amendment was done, these two would benefit from that. They would either serve a life sentence or they would be sentenced to death by hanging.

6.17
MS MARGARET BABA DIRI (NRM, Woman Representative Koboko): Thank you very much Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the committee for the report they have given detailing all the corruption in this project. Corruption seems to be institutionalised and individualised in every Ugandan. Why do I say so? Because this is not the first time we are talking about corruption in this Parliament.

There is corruption in Ministry of Education; there is corruption in Health, in Transport, in Water, Local Government; everywhere there is corruption. If there is a litmus paper to test corruption, I think everybody would be a victim and we would end up in Luzira. 

First of all, we individuals must convert; we must know that Uganda is our country. Whatever is given for Uganda is for all of us and we must safeguard it jealously like our own. But today here in Uganda, whatever belongs to Government is for nobody, so they want to grab as quickly as possible.
We have a problem with our civil servants in implementing our projects and even with political leaders who give directives. One way of corruption is delaying projects. This project was started in 2004, why has it staggered all the way up to now? It is because of corruption; and I think they want bribes all the time before anything can be done. That is where our President comes in; he wanted to see that things are done quickly because it has delayed. That is why he said; please try to be as quick as possible and consult the PPDA, but they ignored his directive of consulting and getting information; and if you look at ESO, which is our security organisation out there, they advised that this was a corrupt company that shouldn’t be involved, but nobody listened because they knew that if they worked together with the corrupt, they would earn more money. So, you can see what is happening. We don’t listen to advice of technical people and we don’t even listen to the advice of our President. I think the President is fed up with Ugandans and that’s why he gives directives, although people don’t implement the way he wants them to do. 

So, Mr Speaker, here we are with the people identified, especially the PS, who said it wasn’t the business of PPDA and they can do whatever they want; should be the first one to go, followed by the ministers who were supposed to give political guidance. I don’t know how much they know about contracts and that is why they misbehave in that way. Maybe when we are putting our ministers in place, let us go through their backgrounds. We cannot place anybody anywhere to do anything and be misled by the technical people.  

Mr Speaker, I, therefore, urge that we condemn corruption and as an institution, we make use of other institutions, which are in place to see that they can act like the IGG, and also we as individuals must convert to save our country from corruption. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Honourable members, I recognise all of you and each one will be given an opportunity to contribute. 

6.22
MS CHEMUTAI PHYLLIS (Independent, Woman Representative, Kapchorwa): Thank you Rt Hon. Speaker for giving me this opportunity.  I would like to say that I am equally touched by the corruption in this country. The intentions for the government are good, but corruption is killing all the good plans for this country. What must we do in order to fight corruption? 

Many people here have talked and given good recommendations for the fight against corruption. I am also saying that corruption should be fought. We need to wedge war against the corrupt and we need to be very serious to ensure that we fight all the way to the end. 

The corrupt are few in the country, but they are defeating us the majority, why? We need to come together and fight those few who are bringing corruption in this country. We need to equip ourselves with tools of war in order to overcome corruption. In fact the corrupt are ready to kill all of us. So, why can’t we kill them first? We should kill them and bury them completely.   Thank you.

6.24
MR ISAIAS SSASAGA (FDC, Budadiri County East, Sironko): Thank you Rt Hon. Speaker. Yes, the corrupt are very few and they are defeating us the majority. Why? It could be because of the weak anti-corruption laws that we have. That is why I implore Members that this is a golden opportunity where we have some Members of Parliament in the process of tabling a Private Members’ Bill, the Anti-Corruption Bill, because they have identified some gaps in the anti-corruption laws. 

So, I call upon Members to join hon. Ssimbwa and put heads together and come up with a strong Bill against corruption. In this Bill, if all Ugandans would declare their wealth, whether civil servants or peasants, then we have the National Auditing Authority, which would audit all this wealth and the excesses that would be got outside what somebody declared would definitely becomes Government’s wealth. If I am Ssasaga, an MP, and I under declared the wealth I have and its sources, should the Audit Authority move and discover the wealth I have to be more than the income I have been getting, then definitely, it will mean I would have got some of the wealth in a way that I didn’t declare.   

In this Bill, even if the President is immune and cannot be prosecuted, if we strongly set the anti-corruption laws, they can somehow maybe trim the powers of the President and make him realise that the law can catch up with him. 

This explains why you say people don’t want to leave power. Why? It is because of some of the directives they have been issuing right from 1986 to date. They know that at one stage they can catch up with them. But you need to protect the institution of the Presidency so that that law can strengthen it and the President will be refrained from issuing some of these directives which could be contradicting the law. I know some of them are good and Members interpret them, but the ministers are using them as an excuse and claim to be sorry for having misinterpreted the directive. 

6.27
MS RUTH ACHENG (UPC, Woman Representative, Kole): Thank you so much, Mr Speaker, for giving me the opportunity. I would like to add my voice, first of all, to thank the committee for the job well done, and also to congratulate and sincerely thank the Members of the Ninth Parliament for vigorously fighting corruption in this country.  

It is true that the money which this country loses through corruption is far much more than the money which we get through donations. If we can really fight this corruption and make Uganda a corruption-free country, we will not be begging donors for assistance all the time. 

It is so sad for the taxpayers’ money which should have been used to help the vulnerable women and children of this country to be mismanaged and misused by a few greedy men in this country, and I would like to say that God will judge them accordingly. 

In my constituency, I had to buy a bed for my women because in one of our health centres III in Kole, women were delivering on the floor. So, I had to pull my own money to buy a bed and yet it is not my work to do so because the money which should have been used for that purpose has been mismanaged. 

Our children are dying innocently in schools, lightning is striking them dead and we cannot even install all the lightning arresters at a cost of only Ugshs 1.6 million in our schools. Now, where are we heading? Where are we leading this country to? Shame upon us!

Mr Speaker, when you read the committee report on page 39 saying that: “The signing of the agreement was rushed...” The intention is that they wanted or they had already planned on how to eat this money and that is why they had to rush.

I respect this Parliament so much. In 2003, this Parliament passed the PPDA Act of 2003. It is being abused. What are we doing about it? Are we monitoring how the laws, which we pass, are being implemented? We have to do something about it. 

I am also very happy with the committee and their recommendation on page 14, where they say, hon. Kivejinja who is the former Minister for Internal Affairs takes sole political, financial and administrative responsibility for all -(Member timed out.)

6.30
MS KEVINAH TAAKA (FDC, Busia Municipality, Busia): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker and Members of Parliament. I just want to thank the committee for this wonderful report. I also want to thank all the Members of the ninth Parliament. Thank you very much for being together. Together we shall stand.

We were elected by the people as the voice of the people. So, whatever we are legislating here is in the interest of the people of Uganda.

I just want to tell you with authority that Uganda loses between Shs 300 to 500 billion a year according to the World Bank report on Uganda. So, I want to plead with the Ninth Parliament; you are a Parliament of revolution. Now that we have started this revolution, this Parliament should fight corruption, and once there is corruption, do not always forget Kevinah, I am always there.

We should let the law take its course. Whoever is implicated should be investigated and they should pay that money. On page 40 of the report, it is reported that the equipment is there and it is waiting to be launched. The equipment came in 2004 and this is 2012. It is almost ten years and technology changes every day. You never know under what conditions those machines are being preserved.

You remember the immunisation vaccines. If they are not kept at the proper temperature, they can get spoilt; so you never know how these things are.

Corruption brings poverty and it gives money to those who are rich while others remain without anything. The women - I want to thank UWOPA who were in Busia and that is why I was not here. We went to the hospital and there were no malaria drugs while the Mama kits are sold at Shs 17,000 and yet here we are told that they are free.

I also want to say that we are not disaster prepared. This is the money, which would enable us to help ourselves as a country to prepare for disaster. We had a report from UNRA that roads were bad; bridges broken like the Kanungu bridge; and also that the ropes were broken somewhere and anytime there could be a disaster maybe like in Bududa. We would have used such money to prevent such things. 

We need IDs. If you do not have an ID, you do not belong anywhere. You do not have a country. Uganda is our country, why don’t we have IDs? It means there is no Uganda. It is also an identity and shows one’s culture. I would want us to have IDs for Uganda. Let Uganda, as the Pearl of Africa, rise and shine again starting with the Ninth Parliament.

6.35
MR SAM OTADA (Independent, Kibanda County, Kiryadongo): Thank you, Mr Speaker and honourable members. It is yet another day that we are gathered here to carry out an autopsy to find out the cause of a miscarriage; yet another bad deal from State House, and with the title of single-sourcing.

Let me thank the committee for the good job that they have done and for making the following statement on page 38, because I have sat here and listened to colleagues but honourable members, I think we should pay attention or have an eye for certain details, which are subtle. For example, the detail on page 38 where the committee says a project of this magnitude requires planning; it requires identification of funds. By and large, it requires preparation because it is not a project that you can conceive in haste. 

I think the committee is trying to tell us that there was actually no need at all for single-sourcing to even be fronted as an idea. The committee is also saying in a subtle way that there was no need for the President to write the letter that he wrote. 

For the comfort of some Members who have been saying that the President should always execute his duty as the Chief Executive -(Interjection)- yes, I agree with you, but how comfortable are you when the President actually does this; steers the ship the way you like and the ship ends up the way it is ending up? How comfortable are you in regard to such a situation?

Mr Speaker, I want to thank you for consistently sticking by the rules all the time. You emphasise that the rules must be adhered to at all times. Mr Speaker, that is what makes sense. Why do we set rules when we know very well that we are going to break them? Why do you establish institutions and when you know that you are blatantly going to abuse them?

Mr Speaker, no wonder, Africa will attempt to transform itself like the guys from Singapore did, if you read that book entitled, From Third World to First World. They did not do that by accident. Rules are followed to the letter and responsibilities taken. People are serious about their countries but this sort of laissez faire attitude that I see where leaders in Africa are full with the principle of impunity! 

Our leaders want to exercise a lot of power in their attempt to have a hands-on approach while executing their duties, but one wise American person said that for those of you who have power, actually the best way to exercise that power is to refrain from using it. I think that makes sense; because that goes to the values of delegation of power; the values of building of institutions; and the values of taking responsibility which we really usually do not do.

Now, Mr Speaker, for the committee - and I want to disagree with the committee here - to think or even feel that Muhlbauer is not culpable, the hand that gives and the hand that takes away in a situation of connivance are both guilty as charged.

Honourable members, the degree of procurement -(Interjection)-  how do you tell me that Muhlbauer, which did not follow those rules is just as innocent as we would like to imagine? In our corruption situation here, we always say that he who gives and he who takes both partake in the corruption phenomenon -(Interjection)- I am not going to take that. So, honourable members, it makes no sense to me for us to say Muhlbauer is not culpable. Did they deliver all that they were paid for? I would want to know that. The guarantee that was provided, is it still valid? Is it still in place? I would want to know that. Mr Speaker -(Interjection)

COL. MWESIGYE: Mr Speaker, is the honourable member in order to say that Muhlbauer is culpable yet on page 40 of the report, part (d) it says Muhlbauer has fulfilled its obligation under the contract? Are you in order?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The honourable member doubts the truth of that and I think it is within his right to challenge it. Please proceed. 

MR OTADA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. You are not in that chair for nothing. So, there are issues of delivery of what these Muhlbauer people were assigned to do. Now, hon. Dr Okuonzi raised a very fundamental point: What do we do with this project? What do we do with it? Does a project of this magnitude which has suffered this major setback still have credibility? If it was founded on wrong principles like the report says - it was founded on wrong grounds - can it still apply? Honourable members, I would like to concur with the idea that yes, we need a national ID, but this whole thing has to be repackaged. We need to start afresh. (Member timed out.)

6.43
MR JOHN BAGOOLE (Independent, Luuka County, Luuka): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Before I joined politics and before I entered Parliament in this Ninth Parliament, I used to hear parliamentarians and politicians complaining about corruption and castigating the vice of corruption. But I want to equate corruption to a very serious disease. Hon. Mariam Nalubega said that corruption is like prostitution, but I think that is a simple term compared to how serious corruption is. I believe corruption is more serious than prostitution and it is even more serious than Cancer or rather AIDS because these days if you detect Cancer early it is curable. With AIDS there are ARVs which can relieve the pain.

A lot has been said, but almost nothing has been done about corruption. I want to commend the work well done by the Committee of Defence and Internal Affairs, but my discomfort is about the recommendations they are giving. Before I come up with a very strong recommendation on their behalf, I want to assure this House that Ugandans are tired. The Opposition is tired; we the Independents are tired; even the ruling party, the NRM, is tired of corruption. We should come up with a very serious measure to curb this vice.

Mr Speaker, in the interest of time, let me give my recommendation if we are to curb corruption. The recommendation by the committee should have been that we look for whoever is implicated, we arrest him, we detain him, we prosecute him - of course prosecuting will just be formalising because here there is no case of either confirming or not confirming whether the person is liable or not. After prosecuting that person we sell off all that belongs to him including his healthy children who are studying in very serious schools abroad. And after recovering all that we gazette a date in a year such that we parade them. Automatically that means firing squad. I want to thank you, Mr Speaker. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members I had seen a long list, I can still see a number of people standing. Those who spoke yesterday could give the others a chance. 

6.47
MRS SYLIVIA SSINABULYA (NRM, Woman Representative, Mityana): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the committee for bringing out this rot. I must say that I am very surprised that Government undertook a project of this magnitude without carrying out a feasibility study and without having a project plan to articulate the objectives of the project. I am not surprised that this project, unlike any other project I have heard about has had 10 names to date: National security information system; national databank; national bio databank; national population databank; information system; national identity card project; Uganda population database; identification and verification project; national social security documentation; and national security information system. So, this project was bound to fail from the onset. 

The other day I was watching the Rt Hon. Rebecca Kadaga addressing African Speakers in South Africa and she said that Parliaments in Africa must come together to fight the scourge of corruption that is bedevilling our continent. Mr Speaker, our commitment to fighting corruption must be shown now. The time is now for the Parliament of Uganda - and I am glad that everyone who has stood up to talk has stood up to be counted - is that from now onwards there must be zero-tolerance to corruption, and I hope that this time, this report is very clear and I hope this time there will be no caucusing to free the people who deliberately and intentionally took these decisions. 

When I was looking at the report in one of the letters from the Executive Director of the PPDA to the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Internal Affairs, he said that if the accounting officer decided to proceed under national security concerns, they should take full responsibility for the conduct of the procurement process.

As a House we must stand to this -(Member timed out.)

MR SSASAGA: Mr Speaker, we were listening to very important issues in the house, but hon. Ruth Achieng and hon. Betty Amongi are continuously and endlessly making noise from behind. I do not know if it is in order, Mr Speaker, that they should interrupt the business of the House?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Speaker did not listen into the interruptions so I am unable to rule. Please proceed.

6.51
MR GABRIEL AJEDRA (NRM, Arua Municipality, Arua): Thank you, Mr Speaker for giving me this opportunity. First of all, I want to thank the committee for a job well done. There are just about three or four points I want to bring across.

Honourable members, there was a report in the newspapers sometime back last year. My daughter was able to read a report about corruption and this is what she said - honourable members and the country at large, listen to what this daughter said - she said, “Daddy, it looks like everybody else in the country is stealing. Daddy when I grow up, I will do the same.” Now this is a child talking; she was 15 years old by that time; a 15-year old child talking about corruption. What you elders do, I will also grow up and do the same. So, what are we telling these young ones? What are we telling this country?

I want to go on record. On matters of corruption I will certainly confront head on. If you look at the President’s letter. He got it very well and said - I will paraphrase - that consult PPDA to get no objection to single-sourcing. Now, when the matter was referred to PPDA, this is what PPDA said, that whereas it is a national security issue, please follow the national security system of the open tender process; and the PS in the ministry goes ahead to say PPDA has no business. 

So, if it was going to be ignored at will - when I was working in Botswana, I participated in drafting the PPDA law and it was enacted by Parliament in 2001.  The sister law in Uganda here was drafted by the same person in Botswana whom I know very well, Mr Sessile, he comes from the Caribbean. If you look at the operationalisation of the laws of the PPDA in Botswana and Uganda, you see marked differences. The laws are similar in both countries. So, when we are talking about fighting corruption here - I used to advise His Excellency the President of the Republic of Botswana on infrastructure matters. Now, let me tell you what the problem is in this country -(Member timed out­.)

6.54
MR GODFREY KIWANDA (NRM, Mityana County South, Mityana): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I also want to join my colleagues to thank the committee for the report, but I want to invite Members to page 40 of the report. It is about the status of the project because I was looking through to see what the status of the project is now. 

“a)	That the NSIS equipment was €64 million and is kept at UPPC  premises at Entebbe. That it was procured and kept there.
b) 	Mubauer company has fulfilled its obligation under the contract; and
c)	the government is yet to attain the following as per the agreement with Muhlbauer:

i) 	building and setting up a national data and personalisation centre, and 

ii) 	mass enrolment of the nationals, refurbishment and construction of the data centre and final contractual payment close to Shs40 billion”.

Now, the chairperson will help me on this. What is the problem? The equipment here is worth $64 million and I expected to see a comment in this report that we paid a lot of money. I expected to see in this report a comment that probably the government - of course, I heard some people were saying there was underfunding of the project, but since we began debating on this - of course, there are also some procurement problems I have identified inside here.

If the committee comes out with a sentence saying that the equipment was bought and it is waiting and even tells us that the contract has no problem at all - now, what are we discussing? It is like the recommendation is defeating the report itself because the recommendation is so good compared to what is inside the report.

We spent three to four hours discussing this and in the conclusion it says that there is no problem, the equipment is available and it is actually upon Government to commission this project and the funding which is remaining -(Member timed out.)

DR JEREMIAH TWA-TWA (NRM, Iki-Iki County, Budaka): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Honourable Members of Parliament, first of all, I would like to join the rest of my colleagues in really supporting this report which has been presented to us. I have been around for quite some time, and I am a student of science, but I also read some history and I would like the Executive to be aware that really, they should look at history when they are taking some actions. The first Government of Uganda had its own vices and because of those vices they actually had a problem.

The second Government was also the same. As a Member of Parliament representing the people of this country, I do not want to be associated with vices of the current Government. What am I talking about? It is the issue about corruption because corruption looks to be the normal colour for our current Government. Ever since I joined Parliament, most of the things we have been discussing on the Floor of the House have got to do with corruption; I believe, this one is very retrogressive, it cannot contribute to development. 

I would like to ask the Executive to take note of this and save us, particularly we, the Members who are on the side of Government because tomorrow, I would like to have a clean name. They should not eat where they are supposed to be guarding. 

I would like to quote – I would have used my vernacular but I will not. Let me at least quote from the Bible, Acts 1:18. It says, “Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out.” I do not want this to happen to us. The Executive should behave in a normal manner and serve the people of Uganda -(Member timed out.)

MR WAIRA MAJEGERE (NRM, Bunya County East, Mayuge): I thank you, Mr Speaker. It is true that we may not be able to eradicate corruption but we should control it to a certain extent. 

Mr Speaker as you know, corruption has been around for some years. Even those who crucified Jesus Christ were given four nails and used three nails, and up to now, they have not established who took the fourth nail. 

I would like to thank my colleagues in the struggle of fighting corruption. I would like to thank the committee for the good report. However, I noticed some loopholes in this report. There are some weak recommendations. For instance, if you look at page 24, there is a gentleman called Geoffrey Nabongo. This man represented Government, signed the contract and he claims to be from UBOS. The executive director of UBOS says they did not sanction him to represent UBOS neither was he representing the Ministry of Finance. But you wonder, the report is just silent on this in their recommendations.

When you come to the recommendation on Syda Bbumba, the former Minister of Finance, the report is exonerating Syda Bbumba. But Syda Bbumba as the Minister of Finance -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Syda Bbumba. 

MR MAJEGERE: Hon. Syda Bbumba as the Minister of Finance; if you look at these documents, she was even more involved than hon. Khiddu Makubuya. But why are we hanging hon. Khiddu Makubuya and leaving hon. Syda Bbumba? When you look at the documents, the Minister of Finance was copied in on every document. But now the report is exonerating hon. Syda Bbumba. This is very wrong.

There are those minutes of 13 March 2010 which the report is lamenting about. Why can’t we have a copy of these minutes as Parliament? This is a test for Parliament. We are going to be tested on this if we can’t have access to these minutes. If it means a showdown with the Executive, let it be, but when Parliament has got access to these minutes. There is the Access to Information Act, 2005. We can use it to access this. 

It is still early to exonerate PPDA -(Member timed out.)

MS JOVAH KAMATEEKA (NRM, Woman Representative, Mitooma): Thank you, Mr Speaker and Members. I add my voice to those of my colleagues in thanking the committee for a comprehensive and well-structured report with fair recommendations. 

I condemn corruption in the strongest terms possible. I condemn the practice of Government officials abusing the trust of the people of Uganda and abusing the trust of the President by disregarding PPDA procedures and denying the people of Uganda valuable services. 

There is a difference between a directive and instructions or guidance from the President. The President guided on several things. The officials chose to do single-sourcing, chose not to check on the performance of the company and also chose not to consult with PPDA. There is no letter from the minister or the PS advising the President that what he had advised was not possible. That is why I join my colleagues in thanking PPDA for taking a firm stand. 

The Director PPDA has not been dismissed, why do the ministers and PSs fear to take a firm stand? The arrogance of the PS, Mr Kagoda, should not go unpunished by saying that this procurement was not the type which should be dealt with by PPDA. Actually, all accounting officers know that they are peculiarly liable for any loss; and for the other officers, Article 164 of the Constitution is very clear.

So, in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the committee, let all those who are responsible be prosecuted and made to pay.

Page 40 of the report says that the company met its obligations. How has it met its obligations when the 200 cards which were produced are sub-standard and faulty; indicating that the machines were not of good quality? When the information on the cards is faulty, indicating that the quality of the training was sub-standard, how has the company met its obligations? Ugandans paid for these identity cards and they should get them without paying any additional coin. The company should meet its full obligations before it is fully paid and I am –(Member timed out.)

MR ANTHONY OKELLO (NRM, Kioga County, Amolatar): I thank you, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, allow me to take this opportunity to thank the committee for the spirit with which they digested issues concerning the National Security Information System, which was given to them and it enabled them to come up with a very beautiful report which we are discussing tonight. 

I entirely agree with the report that the Ministry of Internal Affairs messed up with this procurement process right from the time they insisted on single-sourcing. Before I forget, allow me to take this opportunity to applaud the External Security Organisation for identifying the weaknesses which were unfortunately ignored by the Ministry of Internal Affairs as contained in Annex 10. I acknowledge that there was dire need by Government and the Electoral Commission to procure equipment that would be used in the 2011 general elections.

However, Government signed this contract without a proper plan. It was signed in a rush and there was no clear plan to ascertain the possible sources of revenue to facilitate this project. This forced Government to borrow money from Bank of Uganda to fund this project at a high interest rate of 8 percent which kept building up and this has become a burden to taxpayers. 

At the time of signing, the ministry should have put into consideration the possibility of inflation. That would have checked the figures which were put there. The currency which was used in this contract was euros. They should have agreed on a fixed exchange rate because at the time of signing, the exchange rate was at 2,814 but now it has fluctuated to 3,300 leading to an increase in the amount outstanding to  Shs 7,709,000,000. This should have been avoided by considering the interest rates. 

The biggest mistake that the ministry did was to enter a contract without the approval of PPDA, which is clearly stated in annex four, that the authority advised the ministry to consider open and competitive processes of procurement. But unfortunately, this was ignored.

I wish to draw your attention to page 38, the paragraph which says: “PPDA objected to this procurement.” The last sentence – I request that I read it verbatim. “The Permanent Secretary Ministry of Internal Affairs informed PPDA that this procurement was deemed classified and... –(Member timed out_).

MR IDDI ISABIRYE (NRM, Bunya County South, Mayuge): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Allow me, first of all, to thank the committee for having performed wonderfully. Parliament is mandated to legislate issues of governance. The fight of corruption should be shared. If there was a loan we had wanted to pass tonight, the front bench would have been full of honourable ministers. But because this is about corruption, I can see just a few ministers – they are just two because it does not concern them. 

Mr Speaker, the issue of corruption should be taken seriously. We are here because the people of Uganda entrusted us to take care of their country. But there are a few people that are determined to share out this country. This reminds me of one musician who told us that the country is being mortgaged in pieces. Whoever has money can afford to have shares. 

Mr Speaker, I am totally dismayed by our grandfather, Alhaji Kirunda Kivejinja. It is very unfortunate that he comes from my region, because is one person I would cherish and always consult on issues of governance. This is the second time that a report is implicating him. We must fight corruption jointly and with a will. We must fight corruption with an aim. 

The committee did very commendable work. It observed in its report that there was no plan; there was no budget; and there were no sources to fund this project –(Member timed out.)

MR IGNATIUS WAMAKUYU (NRM, Bulambuli County, Bulambuli): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I think, as Members of Parliament, we need to audit what we have done in terms of these reports on investigations carried out, so that we can see whether to change strategy. It is better than just debating and leaving them to go. Let us cause an audit and allow the Executive to account to this House; we need to change the strategy.

The issue started from scratch – look at storage. How do you keep equipment in Entebbe when you are working in Kampala? There is no value-for-money. Equipment cannot be in Entebbe with the business 40 km away. I think there was a problem from the onset. 

Mr Speaker, the report implicates some Members who are in the House here. I need your guidance; what is the way forward? Members like hon. Makubuya – the report says he should take full responsibility. Last time, he was on the front bench and he was pushed back. Now, what can we do for him as Members of Parliament? 

Secondly, they have recommended that hon. Mawanda was also involved in a similar business. By then, he was not in Parliament. So, I am asking, is there any law which bans Members of Parliament to do business with Government. Even the company which is mentioned; it lost business. It is one of the companies which made a loss. I think let us see how we can harmonise the situation. But I need the clarification of the chair on those issues.

Mr Speaker, Members implicated like KK and hon. Alintuma – it is unfortunate they are not in this House. But if they were here, they would be seated on the front bench; KK would be one of the ministers. Yet there is what we call vetting. Who does this vetting? Do they take into account all these wrongs - but even the appointing authority, because that comes in before vetting. 

So, I think in future, Members should pass a law where presidential appointees are vetted in public –(Member timed out.)

MR AMOS LUGOLOBI: (NRM, Ntenjeru North, Kayunga): Mr Speaker, in our neighbouring country, corruption had taken root to a point that the regime had to go. There was a common slogan there, “Kula kitu kidogo”. That eventually degenerated into “Kula kitu kyote”. They started from eating small to eating everything. And I can see us taking this dangerous trend. With this level of haemorrhage that is so appalling, I am worried about where Uganda is headed to. 

Towards the end of last year, we nearly had a crisis in the economy. The Governor Bank of Uganda used artificial means to fix the economy then and we have not fully recovered from that situation. That was largely because the capacity to supply goods in this economy has been very constrained against increasing demand, due to an increase in the population and integration of our regional economies. We are not responding to the supply needs of this economy because resources are being lost into projects like this one. We have 64 million Euros locked up in Entebbe, lying completely idle. Agriculture is suffering, industries are suffering and our supply capacity is being hampered. 

So, Mr Speaker, the monitoring of Government programs is the responsibility of the Office of the Prime Minister and I think this is wrong because the Office of the Prime Minister is involved in the implementation of Government programmes and so it should not be one of those institutions that should monitor programmes. We should copy the experience of other countries and regular monitoring is one way of avoiding these post-mortem reports where resources are lost; this is one way of arresting these losses before the resources are lost.

Secondly, Parliament is not immune. We have 41 value-for-money audit reports which would help to arrest similar situations –(Member timed out.)

MR JACOB WANGOLO (NRM, Bunyole County West, Butaleja): I thank you. I am also commending the work done by the committee. I commend the patience of the ministers in the House right now and honourable Members of Parliament available. I thank you.

I want to thank the Speaker for allowing all Members to debate because yesterday, people were very happy and they were waiting to see the fruits of this debate. Those who had 100 percent appetite have also disappeared and that means you have endured and have let Members satisfy their needs. I thank you, Mr Speaker.

The word corruption is very soft, but it is older than everybody in this country. In the Old Testament Book of Malachi 3, corruption is talked about. God was complaining about the corrupt. We do not pay a tithe and yet we are meant to pay a tithe, and this is a curse almost because we disobeyed the law. 

Up to now, everybody is corrupt. Why? We are supposed to be in this Chamber up to now. Out of 380, how many are here? Aren’t we corrupt? –(Interjections)- yes, and at the end of the month, we shall say we want salary. I think we should cease talking about the word, “corrupt” and put everything into action. We know –(Interjection)- is there but who wants to say that Jacob will do it tomorrow. I will say no and not talk about it. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, some members have been given authority to travel. They have requested for permission to be out of this House and that permission was granted by the Speaker’s Office and they are not few. Some of them have pressing needs and have sent notes to the Speaker explaining why they have to go; some of them have gone to hospital and so it is not all of them that are not here that fall in that category.

MR WANGOLO: I thank you for that clarification. Otherwise, I commend and I am also very happy to be here to consider and adopt the report from the committee. I recommend that all the recommendations be handled as they recommended. 

I would also like to inform the honourable members and the general public that the letters or directives from His Excellency the President of the Republic of Uganda were very clear, but the then Minister for Internal Affairs abused the directives given to him. I also agree with the recommendations from the committee.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I thank you very much honourable members who have braved it up to this moment. It is 20 minutes past 7 O’clock and thank you very much for sitting with the Speaker, enduring and performing your core responsibility of speaking in this House and making sure that business is conducted. I thank you very much. 

As I always say, if I had a Speaker’s Award, I would give each of you awards for enduring this debate up to this time. (Applause) Maybe in future, we should think of creating some kind of arrangement for this to recognise Members who sit up to the end of our sittings. I thank the ministers who are here. I thank the Leader of Government Business. 

I will alter the Order Paper and allow a policy statement that is already in the House to be laid before the House. Could the Clerk read item No. 3(II)?

MINISTERIAL POLICY STATEMENT FOR THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2012/2013

7.25
THE THIRD DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (Lt. Gen. (Rtd) Moses Ali):  Mr Speaker, I beg to lay on the Table the Ministerial Policy Statement for The Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2012/2013. I beg to lay.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let the records capture that and I thank you very much.  Honourable members, we have had almost all the ministerial policy statements with the exception of two, and we will be dealing with these accordingly.

Members and chairpersons of the committees, the matters are now in your hands and the work starts now. It should proceed because we have a timeline under the Budget Act. This time, we have lost only five days. Last year we lost three weeks and I think this is a great improvement on the Executive’s side; that the ministerial statements have almost all come in and are laid before the House by the 5th of this month. It is a big improvement and we should actually say – they have not been done according to the law, but it is a big improvement and hopefully next year, we will be able to meet the deadline of June 30th.

Statements are still pending, questions are still unanswered. We had agreed that this week and next week, we shall be dealing with this. I am, therefore, going to allow Monday and Tuesday to be for finalisation of whatever statement has not been finalised, questions and answers that have not been provided for. I am allowing tomorrow - Friday, Monday and Tuesday for these matters to be finalised so that this House can come back on Wednesday to deal with all the ministerial statements and answer all the questions that have ever been raised this year and last year so that we begin the session – when we begin debating the President’s State of the Nation Address and the budget, we should have no backlog in terms of ministerial statements and Questions for Oral Answer. The House is adjourned to Wednesday at 2.00 p.m.

(The House rose at 7.28 p.m. and adjourned until Wednesday, 11 July 2012 at 2.00 p.m.)
