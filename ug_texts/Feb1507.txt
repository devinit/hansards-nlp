COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I would like to welcome you to today’s sitting. I do not know whether it is too late to say, “Happy new year”; but I am delighted to see you and I wish you good deliberations. Thank you.

PETITION MOVED UNDER RULE 27 OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF PARLIAMENT ON THE SELLING OF PLOTS BY KAMPALA CITY COUNCIL

2.44
MR NATHAN BYANYIMA (NRM, Bukanga County, Isingiro): Madam Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to slot this petition on this Order Paper. However, I ask for your indulgence: there were some new developments this morning and when I consulted the many people behind me, we discovered that we had to make some changes. I beg that you allow me to present the petition on Tuesday. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay, the petition will be laid on Tuesday.

QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER

QUESTION 18/1/08 TO THE MINISTER OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENT

2.45
MR FRANK TUMWEBAZE (NRM, Kibaale County, Kamwenge): “When will the Ministry of water and Environment provide safe water to Kamwenge Town Council given that only 6% of the town residents have access to safe drinking water, with a jerican of water being sold at between Shs 1,000 and Shs 1,500?”  I thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I do not know who is in charge of government business today, but I think in terms of seniority, let me ask hon. Mbaguta to secure the Minister for Water and bring her here.

2.46
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PUBLIC SERVICE (Mrs Sezi Mbaguta): Madam Speaker and honourable members, I wish to request that we defer this item until next week Tuesday, until we have done more consultations.  

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable minister, we have not been given reasons why all the Ministers of Water are not here. You are undertaking to do it next week but we should know why the ministers are not here.

MRS MBAGUTA: Madam Speaker, our colleague, the hon. Minister of Local Government, lost his wife and his colleagues are attending the funeral service. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: What we can put on record is that we are displeased that the Minister of Water has not seen it fit either to send a representative or to tell us where she is. Even if we have a funeral I think some work has to be handled. Anyway, let us push it to next week.

MRS MARY MUGYENYI: It is true that the hon. Minister of Local Government lost a wife, but we were all there in the morning praying for her and we are back in Parliament. I would wish to inform the House that this is not a good reason why Government is not here.

MR STEPHEN WASIKE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. My concern is on the days that the Order Paper takes outside there to enable somebody to prepare. I remember when I presented my question, I learnt about it being on the Order Paper when I had come here whereas our Rules of Procedure provide that the Order Paper should come out early enough so that people are informed and they can prepare. If it comes on the Order Paper today and the Minister does not have the Order Paper in time, it also brings a problem.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: What I know is that before a question is put on the Order Paper, the Minister is informed. That is the practice. As for you, if you are the one asking you have already asked the question so you do not have to prepare. Normally they are informed. Anyway, they are not here so let us defer it to next week.

MR BARYOMUNSI: Thank you, Madam Speaker, I also want to confirm that the reason the Minister is giving is not really the right one. Most of us were at the service and the service has already ended and we are here. Also, there is growing discomfort among most of us Members of Parliament that the Front Bench is failing to bring business to this House. Even when we try as backbenchers to bring business, they are not there to answer. We want you to either caution them or remind them that they need to bring business to this House so that we are very busy.

MR NDEEZI: Madam Speaker, I am seeking guidance in relation to our conduct of business in this House. Right now, we know the Leader of Government Business is not here. Nobody has stood up and said that he or she represents the Leader of Government Business. The Front Bench is almost empty. I wonder whether we are actually doing the right thing to conduct business as things stand, without somebody representing the Leader of Government Business.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Well, the communication I received was that the Prime Minister is on leave, but in his absence the First Deputy Prime Minister, the Second Deputy Prime Minister and the Third Deputy Prime Minister are responsible for business in this House. At least one of the three ought to have been here. As for whether we should conduct business in their absence, I think we can. They can pick up from their colleagues.

Honourable members, I want you to join me in welcoming the students of St Henry’s College Kitovu. They are up in the gallery. It is a pity that they have come when we are not doing much. You are welcome.

CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION TO NANYUKI III

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Mugambe or any member of his delegation; there is no one who went to this meeting?

MR BARYOMNUNSI: Madam Speaker, hon. Mugambe presented this report to this Parliament and I think the next step was for the Members to read it and then debate. I do not know whether we are in a position to debate when the presenter of the report is not with us in the House. If the rules allow us, then we could debate in his absence.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: That is why I was asking whether there was any member of the delegation who could sit in for him. They were together and I imagine they compiled the report together. Is there anybody?

It seems we have no work today. Honourable members, unfortunately these were the items on the order paper. Since we cannot proceed on any, I will have to adjourn the House to Tuesday next week at 2 pm.

(The House rose at 2.54 p.m. and adjourned until Tuesday, 20 February 2007 at 2.00 p.m.)
