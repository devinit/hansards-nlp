COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Members, I want to welcome you to today’s meeting and to thank you for coming. I am aware of the environment in which you are operating, but thank you for the commitment. We shall try not to keep you very long. 

Before we surrendered our chamber to the East African Legislative Assembly, there was some urgent business which we had committed to some of the committees and which I will ask you to agree to come back and finish on Tuesday next week, that is, the Political Parties Code of Conduct. We are going into elections and we think that we should have a code of conduct. So, there will be just one more other business that we shall invite you back to come and handle on Tuesday next week.

BILLS
FIRST READING

THE INSTITUTION OF TRADITIONAL OR CULTURAL LEADERS BILL, 2010

THE MINISTER OF GENDER, LABOUR AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT (WOMEN) (Ms Lukia Isanga Nakadama): Madam Speaker, I beg to read the Institution of Traditional or Cultural Leaders Bill, 2010, for the first time and I lay the certificate of financial implications on the Table. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: It is seconded. Bill is committed to the Legal and Parliamentary Committee to report back.

PRESENTATION OF PAPERS

11.29
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (INVESTMENT) (Mr Aston Kajara): Madam Speaker, I wish to lay on the Table, Supplementary Expenditure Schedule No. 1 for the year 2010/2011. This is in accordance with Article 156(2) (a) and (b) of the Uganda Constitution and also in accordance with Section 12(1) of the Budget Act. 

Madam Speaker, this supplementary funding will be required to cover a number of requirements including salaries and wages, security related expenditures, election related expenditures and also for missions abroad which need funding. Others will include resettlement of displaced people from Bududa and State House on account of increased mobilisation.

Madam Speaker, among other things which we need to urgently consider in the House on Tuesday, as you suggest, we would request that this be among them. I beg to lay on the Table. Thank you. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: We shall ask our Committee on Finance to handle the supplementary schedule and arrange to report back on Tuesday. As you have noted, the needs are related to very contemporary issues.

I had committed the Bill to the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee, but I want to add that the Committee on Gender should work together with them so that they handle that Bill together. 

Honourable Members, with that we come to the end of today’s proceedings. House adjourned until 10 O’clock on Tuesday. Thank you very much. 

(The House rose at 11.33 a.m. and adjourned until Tuesday, 21 December 2010 at 10.00 a.m.)
