The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you and thank you for all that you have accomplished this week. I hope we will finalise the matters pertaining to the Constitution amendment. Today over the radio, and in newspapers, I heard about Members of Parliament returning money given to them for mobilising and sensitising people about the referendum. I understand those members who returned the money did not use it for that purpose. For that I thank those who have returned that money. (Applause) This shows the difference in running Parliament and running political parties. What is done in offices of political parties is not the concern of Parliament. If money is given in the office of political parties to their members, we are not bothered but if money is from Parliament, that money has to be given to all Members of Parliament. (Applause)

Parliament has no way of knowing what an individual Member of Parliament thinks about a particular programme. We do not recognise statements that are made in the offices of political parties and they do not influence us. That is why this money was paid to all Members of Parliament regardless of the parties to which they belong –(Applause)- and we shall continue to follow that policy. I am the Speaker of Parliament and not for UPC, DP, Movement, or any other political party. I am the Speaker for 304 Members of Parliament. (Applause) Therefore, whatever services and facilities there are they will be given to all Members of Parliament equally. 

For those who have done this very good thing of returning the money, I say we also pay round trips and I would therefore, expect any member that does not carry out the two round trips to return the money. (Applause) Those who asked where the money came from; you all know that Parliament has a vote. It is from that vote that we got the money that was paid to you. We do not use our vote to pay for officials of the Electoral Commission because the Electoral Commission has its own vote. Therefore, when you return the money do not tell us what to do with it. Just return the money and we shall receive it. 

By the way, we expected you to go to sensitise the people but we did not give you a write-up as to how you were going to sensitise them. Some might have been negative, others might have been positive. Therefore, those who are doubting how to return the money, you should return the money in the name of the Clerk to Parliament and send a draft, not a personal cheque. Thank you very much. (Applause)

11.14
MR JOHN KIGYAGI (Mbarara Municipality, Mbarara): Thank you, Mr Speaker for that clarification. There are those members who just go for purposes of popularity on radios while they have not even returned that money. I request that you quietly furnish us with a list of those people who have returned the money so that we know. (Applause)

THE SPEAKER: No, I cannot do that because as I have said I am not bound by statements made in various offices. As far as I am concerned, you swear to uphold the Constitution. If there is a constitutional programme, as a Member of Parliament I expect you to participate in it. So, even those who decide to keep it when they did not participate, I am not going to follow them up. It is really a personal decision for a member to return or not to return the money. However, as I said, members who did not use the money and are paid for the round trips please in the same spirit return that money. 

We are going to the Committee Stage because yesterday we left out one clause, to decide on the Title. Otherwise, we completed all there is for Constitution amendment. 

BILLS
COMMITTEE STAGE

THE CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL, 2005

11.15
THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, I put the question that the Title stands part of the Bill –(Interruption)

MR OULANYAH: Thank you, Mr Chairman. Parliament has taken decisions, which should now be reflected in the long title of the Bill. For instance, the regional government will be the highest political authority in the region with political, legislative, executive administrative and cultural functions. This is totally reflected in the long title and I propose that it should be inserted. 

This Parliament has also created a new provision relating to grants to districts not forming regional governance. I propose that we also reflect it in the long title. I now read the formulation as it should be: “An Act to amend the Constitution to provide for Kampala as the Capital City of Uganda, to provide for the districts of Uganda; to provide that subject to the existence of regional government the system of Local Government in Uganda shall be based on a district as a unit; to provide for the creation of regional government as the highest political authority in the region with political, legislative, executive, administrative and cultural functions in the region; and to provide for the composition and functions of the regional government; to provide for regional assemblies for each regional government; to provide for grants for districts not forming regional government; to replace the Fifth Schedule to provide for details relating to regional governments; to amend Article 189 to recognise the functions and services of regional governments; and to provide for related matters.” I beg to move.

THE CHAIRMAN:  Let us vote on this long title.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position on the amended long title is: one abstention, none against, and those for are 173. The ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

THE CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that the long title as amended stand part of the Bill.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, in the strangers’ gallery we have Prof. and Mrs. Lloyd and family from the United States. (Applause) They were the guardians of hon. Alintuma Nsambu in his early age and they have assisted schools in Uganda to get computers; a number of them have been procured through them. Thank you and you are welcome. 

Then we also have pupils of St. Claire Girl’s Boarding Primary School Namigo from Budaka. You are also welcome.

Honourable members, the Bill we have been handling is conditioned by Article 260, which states that: “A Bill for an Act of Parliament seeking to amend any of the provisions specified in clause 2 of this Article shall not be taken as passed unless it is supported by the Second and Third Readings in Parliament by not less than two-thirds of all Members of Parliament and it has been ratified by at least two-thirds of members of the district council in each of at least two-thirds of all the districts of Uganda”.  

This Bill is also conditioned by Article 262, which states that, “The votes on the Second and Third Readings referred to in Articles 259 and 260 of this Constitution shall be separated by at least 14 sitting days of Parliament.” 

I confirm that the Second Reading and the Third Reading of this Bill have been separated by 14 days. (Applause) For purposes of voting, two-thirds of this Parliament would be 196 members. 

The position on this Bill for the motion for Third Reading is as follows: no members abstained, six voted against, and 249 are for the motion. The ayes have it. (Applause)  

(Question agreed to.)

THE CHAIRMAN: Thank you very much. As far as we are concerned we have completed the necessary process that we were supposed to take concerning this Bill. The next stage is to seal the Bill and that requires ratification by the district councils. Otherwise, we have finished with this Bill. I thank you for what you have been able to do -(Applause)- and for the mature manner in which you have handled it. (Applause) You have indicated that you can handle this business without emotions and tempers. Thank you very much.
 
BILLS
THIRD READING

THE CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT NO. 3) BILL, 2005

12.31
THE MINISTER OF STATE, JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Adolf Mwesige): Mr Speaker, I beg to move that the Constitution (Amendment No.3) Bill, 2005 be read the third time and do pass. I beg to move.

THE SPEAKER: Okay.

12.32
MS SARAH NAMUSOKE (Woman Representative, Rakai): Mr Speaker, I want to move for a recommittal of Bill No. 3 for the purpose of amendment of Article 29 of the Constitution in regard to the control of pornography in this country. This amendment was brought to the committee and I liased with the relevant stakeholders and was informed that I could bring it as a recommittal.  

I beg to request that I be allowed to bring this amendment, which also rises from the Select Committee on Pornography that was instituted by this House and which amendment was brought to the attention of the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs. I thank you.

12.33
THE CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS (Mr Jacob Oulanyah): Mr Chairman, it is true that hon. Kiyingi submitted a memoranda to the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee as far back as when we were examining the Government White Paper and even before the Bills we have been examining. The first letter was dated 16th December 2004. 

In the committee’s report on page 9, paragraph 8 we made reference to hon. Kiyingi on behalf of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Pornography who proposed an amendment to Article 29 to, “Qualify the right to freedom of speech, expression and the press to exclude engaging in any behaviour or publishing, broadcasting or presenting in any manner or for any reason any matter whatsoever of sinful or pornographic nature.” 

The committee agreed with the principles of that proposal but recommended that at that time it fell outside the scope of the Bill. However, taking into consideration the nature of business in this House and especially the fact that we have allowed amendments of this nature that are of significance, I propose that this amendment be considered for adoption. (Applause) Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Did you provide members with copies of this amendment?

12.36
THE MINISTER OF STATE, JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Adolf Mwesige): Mr Speaker, I oppose the motion -(Applause)- for recommittal on three grounds. First of all I have studied the amendment and I am satisfied that it is not a constitutional issue. There are related vices like obscenity that are clearly provided for in the Penal law. There is no doubt that pornography, like obscenity, can be accommodated in that law. Therefore, if the mover seeks to prohibit the vice of pornography, there is no problem with moving a formal Bill for an Act of Parliament to provide for that offence.

Secondly, the original Bill contains 98 clauses. In the interest of time this House agreed to defer and delete 53 of them. Therefore, we have passed only 36 clauses. This House has other constitutional programmes to handle more particularly the constitutional program. Today is 18th August, we should be in the middle of the Budget debate and to allow a recommit one clause would not prevent other clauses from being recommitted. 

Mr Speaker, there must be an end to constitutional amendments and as far as I am concerned this constitutional amendment process has achieved the purpose it was intended to achieve. I, therefore, move that this motion for recommittal be rejected by this House and the mover be advised to move a Bill for an Act of Parliament. I thank you.

12.37
MRS MIRIA MATEMBE (Woman Representative, Mbarara): Mr Speaker and honourable members, in an environment of all this pornography that we have been trying to -(Interjections)

THE SPEAKER: Order, please! Please allow her to make her contribution.

MRS MATEMBE: Mr Speaker, you have just thanked this House for the manner in which it has handled the Bill without passion, with patience and listening to each other, and I would imagine that the same honourable House would like to retain the same dignity. It is against this background that I am requesting this House to give me a hearing because it has a right to reject, and as a matter of time – anyway, against the environment of pornography that we have been suffering and this is the time where we are making a Constitution -(Interruption)

MR OCHIENG: Order, order!

THE SPEAKER: I think we will save time if you give her time to complete.

MRS MATEMBE: Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your good ruling and I know deep down in your hearts honourable members you know what I am talking about but because it is - I want to say that this is the time when we have an opportunity to give a constitutional provision that would give a backing to the law that would protect us against pornography. When you read the constitutional provision on which this proviso is supposed to be put, it gives blank freedom to people to publish and involve in pornography but when this proviso is there in the Constitution it gives the foundation and the basis for Parliament to eventually make laws to govern and protect us against pornography. 

I am sure the hon. Minister of Information knows that, the hon. Minister of Ethics and Integrity knows that; I am sure they know this provision would help us in dealing with this matter. Therefore, I must beg the indulgence of this House honestly to allow the recommittal for purposes of putting this good, useful, strong provision that will help our Constitution to enable us make laws to protect this nation. It is unfortunate for a House at this time to refuse that provision. Therefore, I appeal to the honourable members to see the value and essence of this simple, innocent, harmless but powerful Article that would help us to fight pornography. I thank you, Mr Speaker.

12.43
MRS CECILIA OGWAL (Lira Municipality, Lira): I thank you, Mr Speaker for giving me an opportunity to support the amendment, which is being brought to this House. This country has made history in many ways. One of the ways that Uganda has made history is the way in which we have handled the control of HIV in our country. We have now become an example to the whole world and we have been able to prove that even before the cure can be found, we can fight it, and I think we have been succeeding. 

Mr Speaker, one of the ways that we can be assertive in this crusade, which is global, is for Uganda to be more serious than simply talk about HIV. We have to show that even in our Constitution there is a provision that will help us fight this global scourge. That is why I implore you humbly that whatever it may cause, we are losing people everyday because of HIV, let us be serious at constitutional level and not simply pass laws but let us prove to the world that we are serious that we have entrenched a provision in our Constitution to ensure that every government that comes to power will at least use that law to help fight HIV. 

There is no better opportunity than now for us to entrench it. It does not cost anything. If you want us to kneel down before you, we will kneel down but this provision must be passed. I want to thank you, Mr Speaker.

12.45
THE MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER (Prof. Mondo Kagonyera): Thank you, Mr Speaker and honourable members. I just want to add a few remarks to what hon. Mwesige, the Minister of State for Constitutional Affairs said regarding this proposed amendment. We all totally agree that we have just about done all we can do with the Constitution and there are probative restrictions about the time we have. However, let me add this regarding pornography. 

I am one of the people who re-authored the media law in the NRC and one of the most contentious subjects we had to deal with was the issue of pornography. We spent several weeks studying the subject of pornography and publications all over the world. One thing we discovered is that there are as many versions of pornography in the world almost as there are heads of people. Therefore, there was no way we could establish a standard for Uganda let alone the consideration that there are many ways in which pornography can be published: electronic –(Interjections)– honourable members, I think that is well established; I do not want to rub pepper into the wound.  

Hon. Kalule Ssengo remembers this because he was a member of the committee, our chairman was a priest, Rev. Ongora-Atwai; we had hon. Kalule Ssengo, we had a saved man from Ntungamo. These people put up a big fight but we did research and the office of the clerk can produce for you tonnes of the research we did on pornography. For example, in Scandinavian countries pornography is only pornography when it is exposed to young people and what does a young person there mean? Someone who is 12 years or less. Anybody more than 12 years old can see and watch and handle anything. That is what those people say. Of course you go to other more conservative states and if you take people like Jerry Falwell in American - and we have some Americans in the gallery - that man would probably not want anybody to expose their breasts.

In my culture the navel of a woman is a private part but her breasts are not, that is among the Bakiga. So, when you try to constitutionalise the issue of pornography I do not know how many versions of interpretation - with these few remarks I want to support what the minister said. This thing cannot be constitutionalised because it has no standards and we cannot put in our Constitution a thing we cannot define in one uniform manner. I thank you, Mr Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, let us vote on the motion to recommit so that we deal with this one first. 

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, the position on the motion to recommit, moved by hon. Sarah Namusoke Kiyingi, is as follows: eight abstentions, those for are 23, and those against are 235. The noes have it.

(Question negatived.)

MR OULANYAH: Mr Speaker, I rise as the Chairman of the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee and I would like to put on record my reservations on the way my final speech was blocked. I want to put that one record. All I wanted to say was that you cannot qualify a right guaranteed by the Constitution by an Act of Parliament. That would be unconstitutional. I just want Parliament to understand the point that there is no way - even the hon. Attorney-General should have said this - there is no way you are going to qualify a right that has been guaranteed by the Constitution by an Act of Parliament. And that is the essence of Article 29. That is all I am trying to say.

MR MWONDHA: I would like to add on what the chairman has said that it would amount to derogation from a fundamental right and that is very dangerous. Where would we stop? Freedom of expression -(Interruption)

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, we have pronounced ourselves on the motion. Now the -(Interruption)

MR MUTULUUZA: Mr Speaker, I see that this House is being misled whereby I can put some amazing information here that the motion that has brought this contention here is brought by hon. Matembe who openly and loudly –(Interruption)

THE SPEAKER: We have concluded that matter. What I have now to say is that there is a motion that the Constitution (Amendment No. 3) Bill, 2005 be read for the third time and do pass. That is the motion, and I put the question to it.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, thank you very much, honourable members. This Constitution (Amendment No. 3) Bill of 2005 falls under Article 261: “A Bill for an Act of Parliament to amend any provision of the Constitution other than those referred to in Articles 259 and 260 of this Constitution shall not be taken as passed unless it is supported at the second and third readings by the votes of not less than two-thirds of all Members of Parliament.” 

As I said before the two-thirds of the members of this House is 196. I confirm that the Second Reading of this Bill attracted more than 196 votes. The Third Reading got votes as follows: two abstentions, 38 against, and those for are 220. The motion is carried. (Applause)

(Question agreed to.)

THE CHAIRMAN: As far as this Bill is concerned the next step is for me to send a certificate with a copy of the Bill to His Excellency the President for necessary assent of the Bill, and it becomes effective. 

Once again I want to thank you for accepting the differences and this shows how mature you are. Therefore, you are exemplary to other people in the country. We should appreciate that over 39 years ago the Constitution obligated certain provisions removed but we have with these two Bills been able to restore some of the things that went with the abrogated Constitution in 1966. I, therefore, want to thank you. The Bill has passed. 

I want to thank the ministers, the Attorney-General, ministers of state, the Chairman of the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee –(Applause)- and members of that committee for the excellent performance in handling these two Bills.

Honourable members, you will appreciate that we suspended some proceedings, which should have been handled in June and July and normally we complete the process of the Budget by 31st August but because of what has been going on we have not been able to do so. I think it is high time we started the process on the Budget and see how far we can go. I wish to advise that Members of the Budget Committee arrange to have a meeting tomorrow to workout the guidelines on handling this Budget expeditiously because we have even other important business to handle especially Bills to back up what we have passed in the Constitution amendment. So I advise that maybe tomorrow –(Interjection)- yes, for the Budget Committee to sit. Is it possible to sit, hon. Kiraso?

MS KIRASO: Mr Speaker, it is possible to sit tomorrow and I would like to thank you for making this announcement but also to invite the ex-official Members of the Budget Committee specifically the sessional committee chairpersons, to attend. If they are not around maybe the vice-chairpersons should attend because the exercise involves the participation of the sessional committees in as far as handling their policy statements is concerned. The meeting will be held at 10.00 a.m. tomorrow in the Training Suite. Thank you, Mr Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much. 

MR OULANYAH: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I rise to give very hearty thanks to members of the committee. I say so because I have been with them and we have gone through a lot. There are two incidents, which I want to share with the House if it can bring a light moment. 

We had the first meeting when we were taking decisions on the proposals in the Government White Paper. Mr Speaker, in every situation there is an engine and let me say it today that the engine of this whole Constitution amending process has been the amendment of Article 105(2). That has been the engine. That has been both the positive and negative drive. When we met in Jinja in December, we sat in a room packed with full quorum up to 3.00 a.m. on the first day, and up to 4.30 in the morning the next day. And the mobilisation was – I want members to see this: at 9.00 p.m. on the Saturday we were sitting, I sat as chairman and we had about seven members. So hon. Kinobe called hon. Kiwanda and said, “Man, this guy has put the thing to vote.” Hon. Kiwanda was driving from Kampala to Jinja; you can imagine the speed at which he had to go!  

On the other hand, hon. Odonga Otto called hon. Issa Kikungwe, saying, “Man, the guy is giving the guys the thing.” (Laughter) Hon. Kikungwe could have had an accident that night while trying to reach Jinja. But all this helps because we have to be there, like Lenin said, “We do not mind the turn that history will take, but we will not allow history to take any turn without our participation.”

Secondly, when we were taking final decisions on this Bill, which we have just pronounced ourselves on, we also had a meeting outside Parliament for three days and the proceedings also took that long. This was still on the White Paper. We sent a request to meet the President on the 4th of November and he never responded. 

On the 19th, when we had sat for two nights and this was a Sunday and we were supposed to take a decision at midday, I received a phone call from State House that the President now wanted to see us. I did not tell the committee members that I had received this call because we had not concluded our decisions on the matter. I declined to release this information until we had taken the final decisions, at about 5.00 p.m. on that Sunday, and I told them that, “By the way, tomorrow we are going to State House to see the President.” 

Were we supposed to see the President before we released our report? The meeting was for ten O’clock and the report was not ready! Mr Speaker, that day we worked! We left Parliament here at 1.00 a.m. in the morning but we were back at 7.00 a.m., released the report at 3.00 p.m. and made sure it was circulated before we went to State House, just to make sure that nobody says, “The President influenced the report of the committee.” (Applause) I am just giving you these highlights of what these honourable members went through in order to show that there is legitimacy, understanding and consensus in what we do as a committee. There was a lot and that is why I took this time to thank them very much. (Applause)

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman and the members of the committee and I thank all of you for what you have done. 

We have come to the end of today’s business. The House is adjourned until Tuesday, at 10.00 a.m. for more business. Happy weekend.

(The House rose at 1.35 p.m. and 
adjourned until Tuesday, 23 August 2005 at 10.00 a.m.)
