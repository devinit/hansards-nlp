12176COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRFriday, 15 March 2024Honourable members, as it has been a tradition: I will host the Muslim faithful for a dinner on the 22nd of March at 4.00 p.m., at the south wing parking. I am notifying and welcoming all of you. I am aware that the next general elections are drawing closer. Various political parties at different stages are carrying out registration. I urge you all, whose parties are carrying out the registration, to take part in it. I have been informed that NRM Members should go for registration. I am obliged to give you the information because registration is ongoing. Honourable Members, I will amend the Order Paper to accommodate two motions by the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. The first is to seek approval of the House for the movement of funds appropriated under Supplementary Budget Schedule One for Financial Year 2023/2024 from V ote 13 to V ote 166 and the second one is to table a proposal for tax exemptions for the Financial Year 2023/2024. Those are the amendments that we shall have. I thank you once again for coming. We have called this session in order for us to receive the ministerial policy statements. The deadline for receiving them is today so that we can begin the budgeting process. We must, therefore, receive the ministerial policy IN THE PARLIAMENT OF UGANDAOfficial Report of the Proceedings of ParliamentTHIRD SESSION - 17TH SITTING - THIRD MEETING Parliament met at 9.59 a.m. in Parliament House, Kampala.PRAYERS(The Speaker, Ms Anita Among, in the Chair.)                The House was called to order.COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR THE SPEAKER:  Honourable Members, I welcome you all to this morning sitting. As you may be aware, our brothers and sisters of the Muslim faith started the month of Ramadan on 10 March 2024. This marks a period of religious reflection, unity and sharing across the Muslim fraternity. Aware of the importance of faith as a cornerstone of human existence, I take the opportunity to wish all Muslims a happy and fulfilling Ramadan. I urge you to use this period to strengthen your faith and pray for us, the representatives of the people of this country, to uphold the traditions, the values, and the cultures so that we have a credible society. On that note, I commend the Chief Justice of Uganda, the Deputy Chief Justice and the Bench of the Court of Appeal for the decision to outlaw the registrations of organisations that seek to promote values that are not aligned with our society and want to destroy it. Thank you so much, the Judiciary. 12177THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA FRIDAY , 15 MARCH 2024statements so that they go to committees, and then we shall come back. Thank you. Yes, Hon. Allan?10.06 MR ALLAN MAYANJA (NUP, Nakaseke Central County, Nakaseke):  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for the opportunity. Is it a policy or under regulations for the Ministry of Education and Sports-? The reason I am raising this is that on Wednesday, in Nakaseke District, the LCV Chairperson, Mr Ignatius Koomu Kiwanuka, subjected primary teachers in Nakaseke to PLE mock exams. They were hoodwinked, and sat exams, for those schools which performed badly or whose students failed in PLE.The Minister of Education and Sports should come out and explain how it is implemented. Is it a policy? How is it going to be implemented? When you look at it, some teachers have approached me saying that they are being disrespected. The minister has to come out and explain to the House if it is a policy, and how it is implemented. After those exams, where exactly are the recommendations subjected to; is it to the District Service Commission, or to the Public Service Commission? If some have failed, what next? Those who have passed, are they going to be promoted? That is my concern. Thank you, Madam Speaker, for the opportunity.THE SPEAKER:  We need an explanation from the Government to that effect. Are these people going to be promoted? Is that the best way to improve on performance? 10.08THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi): Madam Speaker, Hon. Omara is asking what finance has to do with the promotion of primary school teachers. I am also holding the portfolio of the Government Chief Whip. In this regard, Madam Speaker, we shall ask the Ministry of Education -THE SPEAKER:  There is a procedural matter. MR SSEMUJJU:  Madam Speaker, the National Resistance Movement Government may have disintegrated, but when you have senior ministers present; the one of health, public service, works and others, and then you have a junior minister standing to say now he is the boss of everybody, answering on behalf of the Government – The Government may have disintegrated because I have seen ministers in Masaka campaigning for “ Pilao”  (meaning PLU) yet they are ministers of a sitting Government. The procedural issue I am raising is whether you have been notified that the NRM government has completely disintegrated, and anyone can be a Leader of Government Business, even when the Cabinet Ministers –If you read the Constitution, it makes a distinction between the Cabinet ministers and Ministers of State. It is not a show or a ceremony. Madam Speaker, have you been notified that the Government has disintegrated and anyone can be a Leader of Government Business and answer on behalf of the Government?THE SPEAKER:  No, I have not been notified that the Government has disintegrated, but I have been notified that Hon. Musasizi is the acting Leader of Government Business. I have already gotten a letter from the Prime Minister that most of the ministers are going to be out of station. They are going for registration. I think that is why they gave us Hon. Musasizi. He can give us the answer if it really helps the community. MR MUSASIZI:  Madam Speaker, we undertake that the Ministry of Education and Sports will come at the next Sitting of this House and give us the status. THE SPEAKER:  Before you come with a statement, can we have an action taken on the 12178COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRground? These teachers are disgruntled; they do not want to go to school because after marking, maybe all of them have failed. (Laughter)  What is the way forward? Is it a policy that has just come? MR BASALIRWA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I wantto find out from my brother in the area: I know that under decentralisation, sometimes at that level, when there is poor performance in academics, districts usually devise measures to address the poor performance. I know that it happens under decentralisation. I would like to get clarification on whether the district has come up with a policy in that line or there is nothing and somebody just took it upon themselves to begin to conduct exams. I think there is need for clarity on that. I am aware that different districts devised different measures to address issues of that nature. THE SPEAKER:  Members, you need to understand that there are several causes of students failing. It may be because of delayed payments, the long distances between where teachers stay and the schools, there is no induction of teachers - there are very many things. You will not only associate it with how teachers perform as individuals. How do you make someone who teaches Primary One to sit a Primary Seven exam? Yes, Hon. Allan?MR ALLAN MAYANJA:  Madam Speaker, for clarity, Mr Komu in 2018 came up with such regulations/directives and I remember the Ministry of Education intervened, stopping this arrangement. There is a way in which they did it recently. However, what we want now is for the ministry to come in and explain whether this is irrelevant, a policy, or is under regulation so that the nation can be guided in that line. THE SPEAKER:  If it is a policy, it should cut across the whole country and not just a specific district. The ministry needs to go on the ground and see whether it is really true, and then action must be taken. MR SILWANY:  Thank you, honourable minister, for giving way. There has been degeneration in this issue of education. You find in different districts, different politicians are now setting exams in their names and giving children the exams. You find, for example, that the person names it “Solomon Silwany Examinations Board”. They set the exams and administer them. It has happened in my district, Bugiri District Local Government. They set exams in a person’s name and administer them. I have seen it. Even party presidents of different political parties set exams. THE SPEAKER : Hon. Silwany, did you set one in Bugiri? MR SILWANY:  No, I did not set one in Bugiri. I was just using my name as an example. I do not want to mention people who are not here. However, some politicians set exams –(Interjection)-  I will come here and lay it on the Table. I saw a party president setting exams. THE SPEAKER:  The rules of this House stipulate that we do not talk about people who are not here. However, if it is true, please bring the document and lay it on the Table. MR SILWANY:  Much obliged. THE SPEAKER:  This is because I have a party president here. (Laughter)MR SILWANY:  To be specific, not the president of JEEMA. I will come and lay the document. THE SPEAKER:  Please come and lay it on the Table. Let me have Hon. Ssasaga, then Hon. Kateshumbwa. 10.16MR ISAIAS SSASAGA (FDC, Budadiri County East, Sironko):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. Over time, in marking centres, UNEB has continuously come up with different marking guides and corrected some of the [The Speaker]12179THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA FRIDAY , 15 MARCH 2024mistakes that teachers make while teaching. Most of these teachers are not examiners. That partly explains why most of those schools are not doing well, especially the upcountry schools. I think where there is smoke, there is fire. In the wisdom of this LCV chairman, for him to decide to subject the teachers to the examination, I think he wanted to assess and prove whether they are really at par with what UNEB requires. That means the burden goes back to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education must have retooling programmes through the CCT centres. They should keep on retooling and updating some of these teachers on the current desired standards by UNEB, which these teachers do not know about. That is to enable most of them to come up and be subject teachers for those examinations. The second issue is that I have seen adverts in different media by the Higher Education Student Financing Board; luckily, the minister is here. In this advert, they are calling upon students who sat senior six and are joining the first year at university to apply for the loan scheme. Aware of the fact that UNEB delayed releasing the exam results, this financing board put the deadline as 15 March, which is today. Most of these students have just received results and others are yet to receive them. These universities have just opened up for admissions. I am pleading with the minister to prevail over the Higher Student’s Loan Scheme so that the deadline can be extended for most of the students to benefit. From what I am aware of, not even a single university has issued admission letters. There was a complaint in this House last year and the previous years about the equity of the loan scheme. Whenever there was a complaint, they would publish it in the papers. What the board or the ministry decided to do was to change. If they were starting with the surnames of the beneficiaries, they changed to the religious name. You could follow the papers and see that most of these beneficiaries come from one part of the country. Almost 80 per cent of those beneficiaries. I also call upon the honourable minister that the board ensures equity and fairness. If possible, we could undergo the quota system in the same way the Public University Joint Admissions Board does. We would know very well that Sironko or Bugiri has this number of beneficiaries of the loan scheme. I submit. Thank you.THE SPEAKER: Thank you. Minister, we need equity and national character. 10.19MR DICKSONS KATESHUMBWA (NRM, Sheema Municipality, Sheema): Madam Speaker, if I was the Member of Parliament for that area, I would actually commend the decision of the LCV chairman. At least, you may accuse him of the method he has used, but he has ignited the debate about why children are performing poorly in schools. At the beginning of the Parish Development Model (PDM), I subjected the parish chiefs and the town agents to a simple test. I was shocked by the level of understanding of what these people are supposed to do. Therefore, the Ministry of Education and Sports, rather than condemn the actions of the LCV chairman, needs to actually engage him together with the district to understand the causes of poor performance by these children. Parents in this country are sacrificing to take their children to school. Yes, there might be other factors, but in our education system, particularly because of the way decentralisation is, the umbilical cord between the centre and the local government has been cut. In the old days, we used to have inspectors going to schools to check attendance. These days, there is a lot of absenteeism and these are some of the issues that people are facing. I encourage the honourable member to applaud the actions of that chairperson and take 12180COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRmeasures to make sure that we understand the root causes of this problem. THE SPEAKER: There is a point of order, but  he has already finished. Honourable minister, can we first hear from you? 10.21THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SPORTS (HIGHER EDUCATION) (Dr John Chrysostom Muyingo):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. First, I would like to begin by clarifying the issue of the advert that came from the Higher Education Student Financing Board recently. This is not meant for the students whose results were released recently, as it is being misinterpreted. Do you remember last year when we were discussing the budget for this financial year and no money was provided for this board? We have been following it up with the finance ministry, to give us a supplementary, which you approved. Therefore, this advert is targeting that group of people. For the students whose results have just come out, once Parliament gives us money, we shall go ahead and make all the necessary preparations, advertise and inform whoever is concerned. Otherwise, this one is not for this category of students. Secondly, Madam Speaker, about what is happening in Nakaseke, as a ministry, we were shocked to learn about this from the media. This is because we know that Nakaseke Local Government is not an official – we sent our team on the ground to find out exactly what is happening. I assure this House that after we have carried out the study, we will report to you. I submit, Madam Speaker. THE SPEAKER: Thank you. 10.24MS GORRETH NAMUGGA (NUP, Mawogola County South, Sembabule):  Madam Speaker, first of all, I thank the state minister for always labouring to explain on behalf of the Minister of Education and Sports. I remember one time when we asked about the presence of the Minister of Education and Sports, you said that you granted her permission to attend Parliament on Zoom. The fact that we have several challenges in the Ministry of Education and Sports, don’t you think, Madam Speaker, that it is procedurally right for you to rescind that decision and require the Minister of Education and Sports to attend plenary such that she can attend to these issues? Concerning the issue on the Floor, don’t you think that it is procedurally right that this is attended to by the very minister because we are missing her attendance in this House? I think that is the very reason this ministry is performing very poorly.  (Laughter) THE SPEAKER: Hon. Namugga, I am not sure whether the ministry is performing poorly. If it is doing so, it is a collective responsibility and not for one person. The person who has just spoken, Dr Muyingo – I am reminding you that he is a doctor and very experienced. He is an educationist with so many schools, and he knows more about education. Unless you just want to have the First Lady in the House, it does not cost much, but she is on Zoom . You can come and see. (Laughter)  Honourable members, as I told you, this is more of a special sitting to receive the ministerial statements. Therefore, let us reduce our – 10.25THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Mr Joel Ssenyonyi): Thank you, Madam Speaker. In your communication, you passed on a message to the National Resistance Movement (NRM) Members of Parliament, to go and handle their registration. I just want to also inform the House – THE SPEAKER: I informed all Members from different political parties. [Mr Kateshumbwa]12181THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA FRIDAY , 15 MARCH 2024MR SSENYONYI: Yes, Madam Speaker, I appreciate you for that, and to emphasise that even in the Opposition, we are carrying out different mobilisation activities; so, it is a good thing to take note. Madam Speaker, I seek your indulgence and guidance for that matter. The vision of this Parliament is a transformed, independent and people-centred Parliament. Our mission is to achieve improved accountability, representation, democracy and good governance, for a better quality of life for all Ugandans. That is our vision, and mission as a Parliament. I appreciate you because many times you have emphasised that we are a people-centred Parliament. Whatever we do is about the people and should be about the people. Madam Speaker, in the last three weeks, the people of Uganda have raised several questions about this people-centred Parliament; questions about how we use or even misuse taxpayers’ money; questions to do with accountability by this House, questions to do with recruitment etcetera. People have been raising these issues in various fora. There has been a deafening silence from this institution, regarding the issues that are raised by the people. As we are saying, “We are a people-centred Parliament”.I have seen the spokesperson of Parliament a few times on some radio stations and TV stations confirming some and saying that some are partially correct and other allegations are exaggerated. However, to date, this institution, which is a people-centred Parliament, has not come out comprehensively and unequivocally, to explain itself to the people to whom we account; it is to the people of Uganda - THE SPEAKER:  There is a procedural matter. MS ABABIKU: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am raising a procedural matter as to whether this Parliament is right to depend on media reports because the Leader of the Opposition was raising issues that are in the media.I thought that we operate on issues that are officially brought to this House. Therefore, I am seeking your guidance on whether we are going to proceed by handling matters on the Floor of Parliament based on media reports and not issues officially brought to the House. Thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members - Hon. Ssekikubo, cool down. There was an issue from the Leader of the Opposition (LOP) talking about what was on social media. The first time there was an issue, which was brought by Hon. Odur and I asked him to write to me. I am still waiting for the letter; I will respond to what is being raised.2. We are debating in anticipation. Matters of the media are not - as this House, we agreed to have evidence-based debates. Bring evidence, lay it on the Table and after you have laid any evidence on the Table, we debate on it and I need it authenticated -3. The Leader of the Opposition, Hon. Joel Ssenyonyi, wrote a letter to me on the same issues and asked that we should discuss the issues in the commission. I replied that we will have the commission meeting and we will discuss those things, come up with a solution and report back on the findings from the commission. Can we have the next item? If you have anything else - Just a minute. Hon. Ssekikubo, first sit down. Let us first lay the ministerial policy statements because I want to give Members time to speak after. These people are supposed to be away. Hon. Ssekikubo, LOP, with due respect, I am going to give you time to raise all that you want to raise and to add all that you have already said because these people are supposed to go.First, I would like to thank the LOP for one thing; as I speak, in Lubowa, they have started construction. I can talk with authority and that is courtesy of the Leader of the Opposition. I am going to give you time to speak. Let me have the ministerial statement.12182COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRMR SSENYONYI: Madam Speaker, I do appreciate your ruling and like I said, I was just finishing the procedural matter and then you ruled halfway through. 1. Colleagues, a few minutes ago we were discussing the matter of the Nakaseke Chairman issuing an exam. It is a media report. So, it is okay for this House to discuss media-related issues that are people-centred. You have guided - THE SPEAKER:  Honourable member, it is not a media report; it was reported by the Member of Parliament of Nakaseke; he was there. He came and told me that he had an interaction with the LC5. Isn’t that true? Go on the record.MR ALLAN MAYANJA: Thank you, Madam Speaker, for another opportunity. I reported what was on the ground as the area Member of Parliament, and I have been interacting with different teachers who said that they were being disrespected by what was going on. That is why I requested the minister to come in and clarify this. I was in the constituency, I got the information and we discussed this matter - THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Ssekikubo-MR SSENYONYI: Thank you, Madam Speaker. As leaders, we do interact with several people. The Leader of the Opposition does the same about several matters including this one. You have guided and informed the House that, I did write to you regarding the Commission meeting, you wrote back to me and said that the earliest a Commission meeting can sit is after 30th June. Madam Speaker, 30th June is over six months away from today and these issues continue to pile up and that is why I was saying that as a people-centred Parliament, it is important - because I am told that the Commission last sat in August of last year. That will have been about a year. So, as a people-centred Parliament, is it not prudent- THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members-MR SSENYONI: We respond to these issues-THE SPEAKER:  First, listen. These are things that are not supposed to be discussed in this House. The Commission sat because you, Members, were complaining about your fuel and the Commission sat to make sure that there was approval of the fuel for Members at the expense of taxpayers- There is a procedural matter-MR NSEREKO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. Pursuant to Rule 87(2) of our Rules of Procedure, Members have been heard and you have taken a decision, and we shall proceed with the matters of the House and have substantive contributions whether matters of national importance, matters that we also have as Members, later on, and that is why we are here. Our rules clearly state that the decision of the Speaker or chairperson on any point shall not be open to appeal and shall not be reviewed by the House except upon a substantive motion, and you have ruled. Unless through a motion - and it is true that she has ruled on a matter of procedure that was raised by a Member and clearly stated that let us proceed with the laying of the documents, then we can move, to move –(Interjections) -  No, the issue of the motion- THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Ssekikubo – MR NSEREKO:  Your ruling cannot be reviewed by this House. It can only be reviewed through a motion. THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Ssekikubo [Mr Ssekikubo: “Further procedure, Madam Speaker.”]  I have not given you the mic. [Mr Ssekikubo: “Further procedure.”] I have not given you the mic.THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Ssekikubo, I want to refer you to rule 89. I do not think you should test somebody’s patience for too long.  (Mr 12183THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA FRIDAY , 15 MARCH 2024Ssekikubo rose_) Listen for just a minute. [Mr Ssekikubo: “Further procedure.”]  There is a procedural matter. Hon. Sarah?MS OPENDI: Thank you, Madam Speaker –(Mr Ssekikubo rose_)THE SPEAKER: You sit down; you will speak after Hon. Sarah.MS OPENDI:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise on a procedural issue. We all have issues that we want to raise, regarding the Commission and the commissioners, specifically. There are issues, for example, on the pay of the commissioners – forget about the service award. This is because what is also coming up is that other than the allowance that this Parliament gave the commissioners, there is payment for servants – THE SPEAKER:  I thought that is what is going to be discussed.MS OPENDI:  Madam Speaker, there is Shs 4.8 million, Shs 12 million for fuel. The procedural issue that I am raising is whether we should not go ahead to lay the papers and then have time to discuss what we want to discuss. THE SPEAKER:  Yes, that is what I am saying. MS OPENDI:  Madam Speaker, is it not procedurally right that you call the ministerial policy statements to be laid and then we discuss the other matters after? Thank you, Madam Speaker. THE SPEAKER: Next item. (Mr Ssekikubo rose_)  Hon. Ssekikubo, you talk whatever you want; I am saying you speak. MS SSEKIKUBO:  Madam Speaker, I am not a member of the Parliamentary Commission, where you are insinuating that you can have matters of such public importance debated. Madam Speaker, where I stand as MP, this House has been engulfed in totally, totally unprecedented abuse. You say we debate other things – we lay the papers – when the credibility of this House is under challenge. We are having a big problem – (Member rose_)THE SPEAKER:  He is on point of procedure.MR SSEKIKUBO:  We cannot sit here as if nothing wrong has happened. I was amazed that in your communication, you did not make mention of the grave allegations against the institution of Parliament, where I belong as a Member. I am here as a Member of Parliament and once this House is tarnished the way it is, I cannot sit comfortably and we say we move on to other items. Can we have clarification on the allegations in the media so that we take a corrective position – so that we clean ourselves, first? We are here to perform – under Article 79 of the Constitution – the oversight function. We are performing oversight roles over other institutions and arms of Government, but when it comes to us, we want to sweep it under the carpet. It is a shame to this House if we proceed when such allegations are on our head and we continue as if it is business as usual. I, therefore, beseech you, Madam Speaker – I beg your indulgence under rule 59(k) and even (m) so that you allow these matters. You would have even issued a statement. If you had issued a statement at that point, we would say, “Yes.” However, to proceed as if nothing has happened and we go to the next item, yet the only issue I have is being a Member of this House – once this House is on fire, I cannot sit there. We need answers. What happened?THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members – MR SSEKIKUBO:  What happened? THE SPEAKER:  Sit down and I give you an answer. Honourable members, I will never – and I am saying “never” – give you an answer on hearsay – on rumour mongering. We are not going to run this House on rumour mongering. I just saw yesterday when they said Hon. Okin P.P. was dealing in cocaine. Hon. Okin P.P. is here. Which cocaine is the guy dealing in? For 12184COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRme to answer you on hearsay – on the things that you have cooked on social media because I have said no to “bum shafting”? I will not. Next item. LAYING OF PAPERSMINISTERIAL POLICY STATEMENTS AND BUDGET ESTIMATES FOR FINANCIAL YEAR 2024/2025THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, Section 12 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, mandates Parliament to analyse Government policies that affect the economy as well as make recommendations on alternative policies. Section 13(13) of the Public Finance Management Act requires relevant ministers to lay their ministerial policy statements by the 15th day of March – honourable minister, you listen. Today being the deadline, I will require the ministerial policy statements to be tabled for onward transmission to the relevant sectoral committees. As sectoral committees embark on consideration of the ministerial policy statements, I urge them to evaluate the compliance of the policy statements under Section 13(15) of the Public Finance Management Act of 2015, which prescribes the nature of information and documents to accompany the policy statements.In addition, the Opposition is required, under Rule 147 of the Rules of Procedure, to submit alternative policy proposals by 29 March 2024 for onward transmission to the sectoral committees.However, I am reliably informed that the Shadow Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development has his report ready and will also lay it on the Table today. He is a very effective person. (Laughter)  He is going to lay it on Table – and that is in consultation with the Leader of the Opposition.I will grant the shadow minister permission –(Member rose_)-  let me finish. I will grant the shadow minister, if that is okay with the Leader of the Opposition and the House, for him to lay it on the Table. I will also expect all the other ministerial policy statements to be presented to the Budget Committee and the Budget Committee will report back to the House.  I now invite the Minister of Foreign Affairs to lay the ministerial policy statement.

COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY TO MOVE FUNDS APPROPRIATED UNDER SUPPLEMENTARY SCHEDULE NO.1 FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2023/2024 FROM VOTE 013: MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND SPORTS TO VOTE 166: THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SPORTS11.21THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi): Madam Speaker, I beg to move a motion for a resolution of Parliament to amend a resolution of Parliament on the Supplementary Expenditure Schedule No. 1 for the Financial Year 2023/2024. THE SPEAKER : It is seconded by Hon. Omara, Hon. Solomon, honourable Ministers of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Hon. Linda, Chairperson ICT, Hon. Xavier, Dr, Hon. Kateshumbwa, Hon. Angura, Hon. Nathan, Hon. Isaiah - Thank you. Speak to your motion. MR MUSASIZI:  Madam Speaker, “WHEREAS on 12 December 2023 under Supplementary Expenditure Schedule No. 1 for Financial Year 2023/2024, Parliament approved Shs 1,932,230,782,760 as recurrent supplementary expenditure and Shs 1,560,693,561,000 as development supplementary expenditure; NOTING, however, that during the appropriation process, a total of Shs 84,920,466,785 was appropriated to Vote 13 - Ministry of Education and Sports, a total of Shs 23 billion was meant for Vote 166 - National Council for Sports and realising that there is an urgent need to correct the anomaly in paragraph 2 above; I, now, therefore, beg to move that this House resolves itself into a Committee of Supply to 12192COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRamend its resolution dated 12 December 2023 in respect of Vote 166 and Vote 013.”  I beg to move. THE SPEAKER : Thank you. I now put the question that the House resolves itself into a Committee of Supply to move funds appropriated under Supplementary Expenditure Schedule No. 1 for the Financial Year 2023/2024 from V ote 013 - Ministry of Education and Sports to V ote 166 - the National Council of Sports. (Question put and agreed to.)COMMITTEE OF SUPPLYV ote 166 11.21THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi):  Madam Chairperson, I move that a total of Shs 23 billion be moved from V ote 013 - Ministry of Education and Sports to V ote 166 - National Council for Sports. I beg to move.MR SSEKIKUBO:  Madam Chairperson, on the 12th of December last year, this House pronounced itself on this supplementary expenditure, but right now, the minister is moving to transfer Shs 23 billion from the Ministry of Education and Sports without giving a justification and we do not have copies. We are at a loss as to whether this Parliament can agree or disagree or determine in one way or the other. We are giving it as a rubber stamp.THE CHAIRPERSON:  Minister -MR MUSASIZI:  Madam Chairperson, as I justified in the motion, under Supplementary Schedule 1, we provided for Shs 23 billion meant for an activity under the National Council for Sports. This was an anomaly and by error. What I am seeking now is for Parliament to allow me to correct this error so that these funds can be moved to the appropriate V ote, which is the National Council of Sports. No addition, no subtraction – I am not seeking for new money, but the authority to be allowed to move money from the wrong V ote to the right one. THE CHAIRPERSON:  He wants justification: what is the money meant for? Isn’t that what you said, Hon. Ssekikubo? MR SSEKIKUBO:  Madam Chairperson, he has said that it is an error, but I take it that he misled Parliament. We cannot sit by and just allow him, without him apologising to this House. If we sit and pass and then he calls us the following day to say: “I am now changing my mind…” Your error does not constitute Parliament’s error. He should seek, formally, to say he is sorry for one reason or the other, and he was misled – but not to take us on his bandwagon. We need an apology, Madam Chairperson.THE CHAIRPERSON:  Honourable members, I would like to remind you that we passed a sports Act here. When we did that, there was money provided under the supplementary budget, for infrastructure in Kampala. Remember, we are going to host CHAN (African Nations Championship) and AFCON (Africa Cup of Nations) in Kampala here. Maybe the minister can now continue from there. MR MUSASIZI: Madam Chairperson –THE CHAIRPERSON: He wants to give you the clarification.MR KWIZERA:  Thank you, Madam Chairperson. While I appreciate the intention of the money being shifted, I would like to be convinced by the minister. He presented a policy statement to the sectoral committee, the sectoral committee reported to the Budget Committee, and the Budget Committee reported to this House and the House approved. Therefore, when the minister alludes to the fact that there was an error, it is an indictment on this House and the committees. The process [Mr Musasizi] COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY12193THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA FRIDAY , 15 MARCH 2024of budgeting, under Article 90, is such that the sectoral committees handle the matter, it is reported to the Committee on Budget, which then reports to this House. I need clarification. THE CHAIRPERSON:  It is not an indictment on the committee. MR KWIZERA:  So, we approved an error?THE CHAIRPERSON:  The formulation of the budget is by the Executive, not ours. MR KWIZERA:  So, did the Cabinet and the sectoral committee make an error?THE CHAIRPERSON:  They are correcting it because there was an error. MR KWIZERA:  So, we deserve an apology from him. (Laughter)THE CHAIRPERSON:  He will come and apologise to you in Kisoro. (Laughter)MR ODUR:  Madam Chairperson, I recall – and this House should have the record – that this particular appropriation in the supplementary budget, on that day, happened at the last moment when we were in this House. Several colleagues and I sought to get clarification, but it was not allowed. I would like to repeat, so that you follow, that for this particular appropriation when we processed the supplementary, the minister did it using a casual letter. It was brought here and, Madam Speaker, you even put it on the record; it was never part of the schedules that were brought to this House. You just bypassed, crossed casually and submitted that, now, you are altering it. We sought to question at that time because it was not processed by even the sectoral committee. Now, you have come saying it was done in error. Madam Chairperson, this could be a very serious matter because the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development casually thinks that they can first hide some money and later come to say this is an error and needs to be corrected. Even the procedure of passing the supplementary and budgets is that we appropriate to V otes. I have laboured before to say that those V otes are equivalent to clauses – that we are passing a law. When you want to amend any clause of a law, which is what you are doing, you come here through a Bill. We have already passed this V ote and it is already a law that should be implemented. Now, you want to amend it here casually; it should not be that way.I wanted to raise this matter to you, Madam Chairperson. First of all, I agree that this minister must not take this House for granted – as he does always. We have forgiven him very many times and he thinks he can just walk and do his things and get away with it. The law is there and it must be implemented. It is you, Madam Chairperson, who should ensure that these laws are followed. Therefore, may this minister be sent back to follow the correct procedure. This House will not go anywhere. We shall entertain you by following the due process and reallocating the money as and when you have proposed. THE CHAIRPERSON:  Hon. Jonathan, the ministerial letter is not just a casual letter. It is an official letter, written to the Speaker, and it was laid on the Table. There was nothing done casually.MR ODUR:  Madam Chairperson, I was inviting you to help this House follow the due processes of the law. THE CHAIRPERSON:  What I am saying is that the letter was not casual.MR ODUR:  In the law, no provision says that when you want to appropriate, you write to the Speaker; it is not there. THE CHAIRPERSON:  It was laid on Table. MR ODUR:  Even the laying, Madam Chairperson - I am just insisting.12194COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRTHE CHAIRPERSON:  So, can you guide us on the best procedure on how we can have this corrected, under Article 193? MR ODUR:  Madam Chairperson, I did mention that when we are appropriating, it must come through a Bill proposed by the Executive. When the Bill comes here, all the V otes in those Bills as we see - V ote 010, etcetera - are equivalent to clauses in the law-making process. An appropriation results into an Appropriation Act, including the supplementary that has been mentioned. Therefore, when you want to amend any law that is in existence, you can only do that through a Bill proposed by the Executive. I have suggested that the correct procedure would be for him to go back and bring a Bill to amend the Appropriation Act, which we passed. As such, this House will then entertain and follow the procedures of an enactment. That is what I wanted to submit. It is not that we are rejecting. MR MUSASIZI:  Thank you, Madam Chairperson. Hon. Odur is correct on the principle. However, I am seeking for Parliament to approve a schedule. At the end of the financial year, I will consolidate all of these schedules into a Bill and bring the Supplementary Appropriations Bill to the House –(Interjections)-  yes, that is how we normally do it. THE CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have something to say? MR OMARA:  Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. I think we take cognisance of the advice that Hon. Jonathan has given, but I would concur with the minister that the amendment will eventually come in the Supplementary Appropriations Bill in June. That is what we have been doing here. THE CHAIRPERSON:  Honourable mem -bers, I want to believe that all this is done in good faith. The moment we do not do this again Hon. Omara will be the first person to go and make noise on social media – Akii-Bua, Akii-Bua, - but what we want, as the minister said, is one, we must host the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) and the African Nations Champion -ship(CHAN). However, do not make mistakes. Do the right thing - Hon. Odur is saying before I put the question - he knows I am putting the question. (Laughter)MR ODUR:  I have been here long enough, and you know it, Madam Chairperson. In this case, we do not want to send information that has not been validated by the Executive. Can the minister confirm? Because I have heard names of Akii-Bua, names of this - can he confirm that this money is going to go for a, b, c, d, on record so that the House can get convinced? We want to see if it is for Akii-Bua, you tell us how much will go to Akii-Bua and for what purpose, for the record?MR MUSASIZI:  Madam Chairperson, the particulars were very clear in the supplementary, which is going to finance activities under AFCON and CHAN - THE CHAIRPERSON:  Honourable mem -bers, where is the Minister of Education and Sports?DR MUYINGO:  Thank you, Madam Chairperson . Under AFCON we are expected to prepare quite several playing grounds. They are quite a number; I do not have them on my fingertips. ( Laughter)THE CHAIRPERSON:  Honourable mem -bers, I have the President of the Federation of Uganda Football Association(FUFA) who knows the playing grounds. The stadia that I know are: Akii-Bua and Hoima. Akii-Bua has already been visited by the contractors. The contract is already being made by the Attor -ney-General. Therefore, we want to know, which places are going to be worked on locally. Can we hear from him? MR MAGOGO:  Madam Chairperson and colleagues, there are two activities, which are intertwined. For us to be granted the right to host the Africa Cup of Nations in 2027, the regulations of the Confederation of African Football(CAF) require that we have hosted COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY12195THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA FRIDAY , 15 MARCH 2024another competition before. For us to be granted, we were also accepted to host CHAN. CHAN is a different competition that is coming in September 2024. Therefore, for us to be able to host that competition, again the three countries need the resources to prepare. And we plan to host CHAN in only one stadium, which is Mandela National Stadium. That is what these resources are meant to do; to prepare for CHAN. Then the AFCON costs that have been included in this will simply be for preparation. This weekend, we received the inspection team, and these expenses are already ongoing.We expected to receive the resources around December, but up to today, expenses are going on, and inspection teams are flying in and out in preparation for the main team that is going to come and sign a contract with us to host the AFCON in 2027. We are already running late. These are not the resources to construct the stadium; they are for preparation. And if we do not do it now, we run a danger of losing the right to host the Africa Cup of Nations. I beg to move.THE CHAIRPERSON:  Honourable members, I put the question that I total sum - [Member rose] – Eh! Boss, first sit down. You have understood what you wanted to know. And you have the policy statements. Look at them. DR BATUWA:  Thank you, Madam Chairperson. Our colleague has given us an account of what is going to be done with that money. However, in this committee, we have the political heads responsible for spending that money. They have not commented to acknowledge whether what he says is what they are politically responsible for or what they are going to do.I am worried that this money is going to become loose money. And being loose money, means it can be even shared. Therefore, Madam Chairperson, let the political heads acknowledge what we have just heard. THE CHAIRPERSON:  Please do.DR MUYINGO:  Madam Chairperson and dear colleagues, I do accept that whatever my colleague is saying is acceptable to us. THE CHAIRPERSON:  That is enough. Honourable members, I put the question that the sum of Shs 23 billion, be moved from V ote 013 - Ministry of Education and Sports, to V ote 166 - National Council of Sports. (Question put and agreed to.)MOTION FOR THE HOUSE TO RESUMETHE CHAIRPERSON:  I get surprised when I hear Hon. Asinansi saying “No” when Hoima is one of the beneficiaries. Yes, minister?11.46THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi):  Madam Chairperson, I beg to move that the House do resume and the Committee of the whole House reports thereto.

From what we have just gone through, there are clear signs that the country is adequately gearing towards the Africa Cup of Nations and the other games. Madam Speaker, it would be procedurally correct for the Ministry of Education and Sports and the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, as we look at these facilities that will be built, to also begin considering some of the areas that are near, for example, when you look at Akii-Bua in Lira, a stadium like Pece War Memorial Stadium would be the best place for the players to prepare as they go for the tournament. Again, we have Gulu Airport, which would be the best place for the players to fly in. So, we need to look at places like Gulu – THE SPEAKER:  And Soroti. MR MAPENDUZI:  Exactly, places like Gulu, Soroti, Arua and nearby places; we need to invest and prepare those places. Therefore, it would be procedurally correct for the ministry to pull resources -THE SPEAKER:  You have already given a response to your procedure. But the minister has something to say.GEN. KATUMBA:  Madam Speaker, I just wanted to give information to the honourable member that plans are underway to expand Gulu Airport and do the road from Corner Ayer to Corner Aboke, Corner Iceme to Bobi so that if the team lands in Gulu, they can take a shortcut to Lira. THE SPEAKER:  Yes, honourable member for Kampala Central?11.49MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO (Indepen -dent, Kampala Central Division, Kampala City):  Thank you, Madam Speaker and hon -ourable colleagues. I think Hon. Mapenduzi raises a great matter for us to take note of: rath -er than the infrastructure based on roads and others, but also the sports infrastructure. Probably, we would use this opportunity not only to focus on the big stadia, but also what we call the regional feeder stadia, or even at the district level. For example, the creation of better stadia, we can even go for regions; in Kigezi, we pick one and in Mbarara, Kakyeka. Then we pick from each of the divisions of Kampala where we have the highest concentration and the metropolitan areas of Wakiso and Entebbe Municipality and use part of these funds to improve sports infrastructure.If you came up with such a proposal, I can assure you, I do not think there is any Member of this House that would decline to support you. Even in as much as we might not all come here to ask for big stadia, the backup support infrastructure, training - not necessarily training grounds. COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY [Mr Musasizi]12197THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA FRIDAY , 15 MARCH 2024When we were in Rwanda for the recent East African Legislative Assembly Games, we had those mini stadia; the small ones, where you know, at the regional level, which might not have a big capacity of over 3,000 or over 5,000 people, but even if it was 2,000, well-hoarded and with changing rooms, and then we can improve. We can say that out of the African Cup of Nations (AFCON and CHAN), this is exactly what we benefitted. We can have one in Ankole, in Kigezi, regionally, and in Kampala Metropolitan, at every division.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. Honourable members, we missed out on one ministerial statement.LAYING OF PAPERSTHE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES COMMISSIONTHE SPEAKER:  Honourable minister - Hon. Ssekikubo, Hon. Hellen is –11.51THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR GEN -DER, LABOUR AND SOCIAL DEVEL -OPMENT (DISABILITY AFFAIRS) (Ms Hellen Asamo):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I apologise that the statement came in a bit late. However, under Section 13 of the Public Fi -nance Management Act, 2015 and the Rules of Procedure of Parliament, I move that the Min -isterial Policy Statement for V ote 124 - Equal Opportunity Commission for the Financial Year 2024/2025, be laid. THE SPEAKER : Hon. Tonny, pick it - he is nearer. MS ASAMO:  I beg to lay. You are giving me my good friends only. Thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. It is referred to the Committee on Gender, Labour and Social Development, pursuant to Rule 146(3). Yes, Hon. Ariko?11.52MR HERBERT ARIKO (NRM, Soroti East Division, Soroti City):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I was following up on a matter that my brother, Hon. Martin Ojara Mapenduzi raised. The Minister of Transport and Works gave us a very good response as far as Gulu, in terms of the airport and the road are concerned. However, Madam Speaker, Soroti Flying School, which is the East African School of Aviation, is probably one of the oldest aviation facilities, other than Entebbe, that we have. I seek clarification from the minister that as we plan for these additional ones in other places in the country, what is the plan of the ministry, as far as ensuring that we harness the best possible use of Soroti Flying School, which has the second longest tarmac runway other than Entebbe, in the country –  which probably has some of the biggest aviation facilities and equipment in the country after Entebbe? I do not hear this.Secondly, Mr Minister, I know that you are looking at the visitors flying into Gulu, but as you know, Soroti is only one hour away from Lira. We would be glad for you to also tell us what you are thinking in terms of road infrastructure around this sub-region. I thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you, Hon. Ariko. Yes, honourable minister. 11.54THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT AND WORKS (Gen. Edward Katumba): Thank you, Madam Speaker. Hon. Ariko, Soroti Flying School, if you recall, was an East African facility. We are still, through the Ministry of East African Community Affairs, fighting to get this facility under the Government of Uganda. We are still negotiating with the other member countries; the original member countries of East Africa – that is Kenya and Tanzania – to let go of this facility so that the Government can now invest in it knowing it is 12198COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRours. The negotiations are still ongoing and we are waiting to see how far we will go with this.Therefore, it is now very difficult for me to get money from the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to fully invest or get a vote for this flying school because we do not own it as a Government. THE SPEAKER:  You mean the Government of Uganda does not own Soroti?GEN. KATUMBA:  The legal status of Soroti Flying School is still a matter to be decided between East Africa and the Government. THE SPEAKER:  I thought that is a matter of law.MR EKANYA:  Madam Speaker, I seek clarification from the honourable minister. We have been investing in Soroti Flying School. We even bought an aircraft. President Museveni is the one promoting the East African Community. Can you clarify to this Parliament, how your discussion to own stops you from investing money to allow the guest to use the facility, or make it better, so that when President Museveni or the Speaker of Parliament with the Members of Parliament go to other countries, they can say this facility is for East Africa, but Uganda is investing money and is a model that we desire for the East African cooperation?THE SPEAKER:  And honourable minister, one thing you need to note, is that the land for Soroti Flying School is being encroached on. The land has been taken away. Yes - I see the whole of Soroti standing up.MR ARIKO:  I thank you, Madam Speaker. Honourable minister, I am happy that you said that at the moment the Government of Uganda is not able to invest heavily in this aviation school because it belongs to the former original East African Community. Madam Speaker, I request the minister that as he clarifies on what Hon. Ekanya has raised, to also help me understand who at the moment pays the common cadre staff who work at this aviation school, for instance, the accountants, the administrators, the human resources officers and so on?Secondly, what about the technical staff - the engineers, the instructors and the pilots? If it is the Government of Uganda, is this investment or not? Why then do you keep people paid without making the facility more economically viable? I thank you. THE SPEAKER: Another point of information from this side. MR KATESHUMBWA: Madam Speaker, I like the debate that is going on. However, while we congratulate the ministry for the significant work that has been done at Entebbe International Airport, the debate is now talking about the airstrips. We are excited about hosting the Africa Cup of Nations, but daily, we have tourists who come into this country. Therefore, the debate should extend, if we are talking about airstrips. For example, we have Kisoro Airport. Kisoro is a place where we get 60 per cent of our tourist revenues because of the mountain gorillas. However, it is in a very poor state. Notices have been issued, and all the time being closed and opened. We also have Kidepo National Park and others that serve the tourism industry. Madam Speaker, I request that the minister be given time to table a comprehensive report about the status of these airstrips and their strategic plan. We have seen directives by the President to rehabilitate some of them, but we have not seen anything being done. So, rather than have piecemeal – cherry-picking of one airstrip and leaving the others, let us have a comprehensive status so that we can debate. The Africa Cup of Nations will come and go, but tourists come every day yet we have airports and airstrips that have been neglected. I beg to submit. THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I am happy that you are now talking about policy issues. Now that we have ministerial policy [Gen. Katumba]LAYING OF PAPERS12199THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA FRIDAY , 15 MARCH 2024statements, this is the right time for you to deliberate and include all these in those policy statements. Therefore, minister, you have to give an input on those issues and then have a comprehensive statement on the whole country. I also instruct all the sectoral committees to report back in two weeks, meaning that all Members are going to be in sectoral committees. There will be no House sitting, but there will be committee sittings. Committees will be sitting to consider issues in the policy statements; the House will not sit for the next two weeks until 28 March 2024. On 28 March 2024, the House will resume with a statement from the Leader of the Opposition on the alternative policy statements. I now adjourn the House to 28 March 2024. (The House rose at 12.01 p.m. and adjourned until Thursday, 28 March 2024.)
