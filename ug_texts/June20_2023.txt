So, the Business Committee is duly informed that there will be a meeting to discuss the Business of the Session.Honourable members, before we broke off, I received a resignation letter from the chairperson of the Committee on Public Accounts (Local Government), Hon. Mapenduzi. He has resigned from the position of chairperson of the Committee on Public Accounts (Local Government). We acknowledged and accepted his resignation.However, he has reports to present and he should be able to present those reports because those are reports of the House, not his. We will let him go wherever he wants to go. The resignation is effective immediately. I put the question to his resignation. (Question put and agreed to.)THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, you do not force somebody to be where they do not want to be; you let them go.Honourable members, on a rather sad note, on Saturday, we woke up to very bad news of the killing of about 43 students in Mpondwe, Kasese District. They were allegedly killed IN THE PARLIAMENT OF UGANDAOfficial Report of the Proceedings of ParliamentTHIRD SESSION - 3RD SITTING - FIRST MEETINGParliament met at 1.59 P .m. in Parliament House, Kampala.PRAYERS(The Speaker, Ms Anita Among, in the Chair.)The House was called to order.COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRTHE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, I welcome you to this afternoon sitting. I would also like to welcome you back from recess . (Applause)As we embark on this Third Session, I would like to give you a kind reminder that we have only two years remaining. We must work towards a people-centred Parliament, and also work towards coming back to Parliament. We can assure you of our unwavering support, as Parliament, to ensure that you are all here. You are a beautiful team. We love you so much. (Applause)Honourable members, in line with my undertaking during the Address on the State of the Nation and the Budget Speech, we agreed to ensure regular attendance and participation both in the House and in committees. Based on that, we are making sure that the biometric login system is working. Next week, we shall be publishing the attendance and performance for the last Session. We do account to our people. We are here to 9139THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 20 JUNE 2023by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF). That was a tragic occurrence. It opens up the scars of the previous tragedies that have happened. In 1998, there was an attack at Kichwamba Technical Institute in Kabarole, where students were burnt. In 1991, there was the abduction of students from Sacred Heart in Gulu. In 1996, there was also an abduction of girls from Aboke in Oyam. We sincerely condole with the bereaved families and management of the school, the people of Kasese and all the people of Uganda. We condemn this loss in the strongest terms. Such actions are very unproductive and should be investigated and the perpetrators brought to book.It is a very bad incident. Just imagine you are killing your kid or grandkid. You wake up thinking your kid is at school and you just get the news that your kid has been killed! It is a bad incident.I call upon the Minister of State for Higher Education, who was at the site, to come and give us a statement on what his findings were and what the Government is planning to do. The Minister of Internal Affairs was also there. I am happy that the Prime Minister is also in the House. They should be able to give us a statement on what happened and what the Government is planning to do.Honourable members, on Saturday, 17 June 2023, we received the tragic news of the demise of Justice Stella Arach-Amoko of the Supreme Court. The deceased had an illustrious career as a judicial officer. We condole with the family, the Judiciary, the people of West Nile and all the people of Uganda. Please, accept our condolences for the loss of this very industrious lady.On behalf of Parliament, we sincerely convey our condolences to the families of the children who died, the Judiciary and all the people of Uganda. Much as the Bible says there is a time to be born and a time to die, one should die in an acceptable way, and not in the way the children were killed. We put all that in God’s hand. May their souls rest in eternal peace. May we rise please and observe a moment of silence in their honour?(Members rose and observed a moment of silence.)THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, on the 29th of May, His Excellency the President returned the National Sports Bill, 2023, for reconsideration by Parliament, pursuant to Article 91(3)(b) of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda.In furtherance to Rule 143 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament, I hereby read the letter as it came. It is dated 17 May 2023, written to the Rt Hon. Anita Among, Speaker to Parliament. Reference is, National Sports Bill, 2023: “I have received the National Sports Bill, 2023, for assent. I have been advised that there are provisions that need to be reviewed in order to facilitate the proper regulation of the sports sector, as listed below;i) Insection2,thereisaneedtodefinetheterm “Representatives.”ii) Section 32 - Board of National Council of Sports.iii) Section 32(2) provides that the Board shall consist of the following members;a) A representative from the ministry responsible for sports,b) Two representatives of regions of Uganda, one of whom shall be a person with a disability,c) A representative of a national sports association or national sports federation,d) A representative of athletes,9140DESIGNATION OF MEMBERS TO SECTORAL COMMITTEESe) A representative of the private sector and a person with experience in sports administration.iv) Section 32(2) still should be amended to provide as follows;1) A national council of sports shall have a board of seven members, which shall be the governing board of the council.2) The board consists of the chairperson and other six members.a) A representative of a ministry responsible for sports.b) Two representatives from any traditional regions of Uganda.2c) A representative of national sports associations or federations.d) A representative of the athletes.e) A representative of the private sector and a person with experience in sports administration.3) A member of the board referred to in subsection (2) shall be a person with knowledge and experience in sports administration.4) The minister shall appoint members of the board, taking into consideration the following;i) The interest of the sports sector.ii) The shareholders of the sports sector.iii) Persons with disability.iv) Gender balance. Thejustificationoftheproposedamendmentisthe need to have a small board that will not put a financial constraint onGovernment resources.The same has been done to other Government agencies and authorities. It will also ease the decision-making of the institution. Section 75(1) provides that the land on which the public sports facilities are established and public sports facilities thereon, shall vest in the council. There is need to make provisions for the schedule for sports facilities that will be vested in the council, specifying the location of the sports facility, the acreage and the current registered proprietor or proprietors of the sports facilities. The procedure for vesting the property in the council should be provided for. 5) In Schedule 2 - national sports discipline recognised at the commencement of the Act: Whereas the National Council of Sports has 51 recognised national sports federations, the list in Schedule 2 provides for 50 national federations or associations. In addition, Kickboxing provided for under the schedule is no longer a recognised sport by the council and should, therefore, be deleted. Archery should be added to the schedule as it is recognised by the National Council of Sports.Therefore, in accordance with Article 91(3)(b) of the Constitution (1995), I am hereby returning the Bill to Parliament for reconsideration of the clauses that have been mentioned above.Signed by Yoweri Museveni, President of the Republic of Uganda.”Accordingly, this has been referred to the Committee on Education and Sports. They should work on it and report back to the House immediately.Honourable members, you will allow me to amend the Order Paper and accommodate the laying of the Parliamentary Pension Access to Midterm Benefits. That is regulation 2023. Remember, we passed the law, but did not have the regulations in place. I will ask the chairperson to bring the regulations and lay them on the Table so that you can be able to access your midterm money and know how you should do it. Do not suffer when you have your money in the pension scheme.[The Speaker]COMMUNICATION  FROM THE CHAIR9141THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 20 JUNE 2023The regulations are ready; they stipulate the terms and conditions. Chairperson of the board, could you first lay that? I know you have a point of procedure, but I want them laid first.2.18MR ARINAITWE RWAKAJARA (NRM, Workers Representative):  Madam Speaker, in accordance with rules 31 and 32 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament, I beg to lay for approval, “The Parliamentary Pension’s Access to Midterm Benefits Regulations, 2023.” You remember well that in 2022, Parliament amended the Parliamentary Pensions Act, 2007 to introduce, among other matters, provisions on midterm access to members’ benefits.Section 13A of the Parliamentary Pensions Act grants Members and staff of the Parliamentary Commission midterm access to benefits accrued from the contributions. Midterm access allows a member to access a portion of his or her scheme credit and to utilise the same before he or she retires. The principal of the midterm access is to cater for unexpected challenges in the life of a member who may need to utilise some of his or her scheme credit before he or she retires. Section 13A of the Parliamentary Pensions Act restricts access to midterm benefits to the scheme for at least 10 years of age and above and made contributions to the scheme for at least 15 years.THE SPEAKER:  Just lay the document. We shall look at it. Members will read and understand what is in the document.MR RWAKAJARA:  Madam Speaker, I thought I needed to explain to them. Since they know the justification -THE SPEAKER:  We passed the law and we know what is in it. MR RWAKAJARA:  Allow me, therefore, Madam Speaker, to lay on the Table the Parliamentary Pensions (Access to Midterm Benefits) Regulations, 2023. Thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. Honourable members, in the public gallery, we have very beautiful children from Sir Apollo Kaggwa Primary School. (Applause) You are most welcome and thank you for coming. This is your Parliament. These beautiful kids are from Kampala Central Division. They are represented by Hon. Kazibwe Bashir and Hon. Shamim Malende. You are most welcome. You are very smart. (Applause)  Also, in the public gallery this afternoon, we have Muslim leaders from Kagoma County, Jinja District. They are represented by Hon. Walyomu and Hon. Katali. You are most welcome. Thank you for coming. Asaalam Aleikum . (Member rose_)Honourable member, why are you standing? In my communication, I asked the Prime Minister for a brief statement on what happened in Kasese and I know all of you want to talk about Kasese. Let us first know what happened; let us not speak out of the blue. The Prime Minister is in the House. Honourable members, we need to debate from an informed point of view.2.23THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Ms Robinah Nabbanja): Madam Speaker, what happened in Kasese is a regrettable incident. The Government is going to present a statement through the Ministry of Education and Sports since this was a school and the minister is here.THE SPEAKER:  Let us listen to the procedural matter and then allow the minister to give us a report so we can debate it.MR SEMMUJJU:  Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. May I request a second before I raise the procedural issue?There are things we take for granted – Madam Speaker, thank you, for keeping time.  (Applause)  This Parliament used to start at 5.00 p.m. In Uganda, timekeeping is very difficult. Someone said he would be a President for five years, but it is now 40 years . (Laughter)9142DESIGNATION OF MEMBERS TO SECTORAL COMMITTEESI know our President is a President of advanced age. That is why sometimes he asks other government officials to act, including those who are suspects. The procedural issue I am raising is - the law does not stop the President from delegating, but issues of security and defence are very serious matters. We passed here a budget and policies that are not overseen by the wife of the President. You cannot run this country in that way, where your wife says, “Darling, can I be the one to speak about the attack in Kasese? Okay, baby, go ahead”. (Laughter)  On this matter, we need the minister responsible for defence. We passed money here and gave it to the defence ministry to defend Uganda’s borders. Hon. Muyingo is a very obedient and loyal person. Even what he should not do, he wants to do. I do not know what he was doing in Kasese at a crime scene.THE SPEAKER:  It was in a school. Honourable members, Hon. Ssemujju is raising a very serious issue. Can we have a report tomorrow from the Ministry of Defence and Veteran Affairs? We will not discuss anything. Let us get a report from the Ministry of Defence and Veteran Affairs; let us not gamble.DR MUYINGO:  Most obliged, Madam Speaker.MR SSEMUJJU:  If you appointed people like my brother, Hon. Ssempijja -THE SPEAKER:  I thought I ruled already.MR SEMMUJJU:  I was raising a procedural issue.THE SPEAKER:  No. Sit. (Laughter)MR MACHO:  Madam Speaker, I would like to thank you. I rise on a procedural matter -THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Allan, you are most welcome. (Applause)MR MACHO:  Madam Speaker, I want to appreciate you for making this Parliament a people-centred Parliament where legislators have observed their roles and mandate effectively.I do not know whether we are proceeding well for the Prime Minister not to have a statement on the standoff between the Opposition oversight work to hospitals, because we see it bringing a push and shove. Moreover, we are the same people in the same House. Madam Speaker, you echoed Parliament being people-centred; we had the State-of-the-Nation Address and the Budget Speech. In all these very important events, I did not see my friend, the Chief Opposition Whip, Hon. Nambeshe and his people. Madam Speaker, Members of Parliament are elected. I do not know whether we are proceeding well to have the Opposition here when they did not appear for the Budget speech and the State-of-the-Nation-Address. Thank you, Madam Speaker. THE SPEAKER:  When you are at that level of mental health, even your eyes become blind. (Laughter)  I saw the Opposition Members. If you did not see them - I saw them and there was no gap. Was there any gap? Therefore, there is no problem. Members, I want us to start serious business. All of you should resume your seats. Before we start, I first want committees to be designated. I also ask the Government Chief Whip, the Chief Opposition Whip and the Dean of the Independents to do the designation before we go into anything else.DESIGNATION OF MEMBERS TO SECTORAL COMMITTEES PURSUANT TO RULE 187(1) OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURETHE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, rule 187(1) of the Rules of Procedure prescribes that there shall be a sectoral committee of the [Mr Ssemujju]COMMUNICATION  FROM THE CHAIR9143THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 20 JUNE 2023House whose Members shall be designated by the Whips of political parties, organisations represented in the House, and that is inclusive of Independents, at the beginning of every session of Parliament.The constitution of the sectoral committees is, therefore, a precondition for the timely commencement of work by sectoral committees. Rule 15(10)(c) of the Rules of Procedure will now require the Whips to designate their Members to the sectoral committees. This designation will be guided by rule 188 of our Rules of Procedure and we will begin with the National Resistance Party followed by the Opposition and then the Independents. The designation will be done for each and every committee by the Whips and then it will be put to question. If you are not comfortable with it, do not allow it. 2.32THE GOVERNMENT CHIEF WHIP (Mr Hamson Obua):  Madam Speaker –THE SPEAKER:  Government Chief Whip, can you just read the name of the committee and then the members?COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL INDUSTRY AND FISHERIESMR OBUA:  Madam Speaker, in conformity with the Rules of Procedure of Parliament, I beg to designate the following to the leadership and membership of the Committee on Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries.1.

As you are aware, we have grown to 529 Members. The Whips need to go back, reconcile and bring the names that they will have removed from one committee to the other for re-designation. However, for now, we are going to designate the Members. Where you hear Hon. Linda’s name read twice, she is an Independent who is a vice-chairperson. I am the Dean of the Independents; so, my Member is a vice-chairperson. (Applause)Honourable members, I put the question that the sectoral Committee on Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries be constituted as read by the whips of the NRM, the Opposition and the Independents.

Pursuant to Rule 187(1) – to the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs, the Rt Hon. Speaker designates the following Members: 1. Hon. Margaret Lamwaka of Chua East County; 2. Hon.

I put the question that the sectoral Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs be constituted as proposed. (Question put and agreed to.)COMMITTEE ON EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY AFFAIRS2.43THE GOVERNMENT CHIEF WHIP (Mr Hamson Obua):  Madam Speaker, pursuant to Rule 187(1) of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament, I beg to designate the following to the Committee on East African Community Affairs:1. Hon. Noeline Kisembo Basemera -THE SPEAKER: There is a procedural matter. Hon. Ssemujju, when people are serious and you get up on procedure! You are interrupting.MR SSEMUJJU:  Madam Speaker, I am looking at rules 160, 187 -THE SPEAKER:  By the way, the UPDF dean informed me that she had delayed, but that she is coming to designate. Has she arrived? Do you have the list? Do you have somebody for defence?MR SSEMUJJU: Madam Speaker, the procedural issue I am raising relates to rules 160 and 187. These rules provide for how Members are designated to committees. They are designated by whips on behalf of parties and the Speaker, in the case of the Independents. However, they do not provide for the designation of UPDF Representatives. I think the rule assumes that the UPDF should be in Kasese defending the people, and not in Parliament. (Laughter)So, Madam Speaker, can I be advised on the rule under which the UPDF sat and even appointed someone “dean” and that “dean” parades before Parliament to begin reading names? Under rule 160, it is parties through the whips, and the independents, through the Speaker. Under rule 187, it is, again, for parties and independents. Can the UPDF, who are supposed to be in Kasese – by these rules – tell us the rule under which they are going to designate themselves?THE SPEAKER:  I refer you to rule 188(6), which says: “ The Party or Organisation in Government shall designate the Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson of each Sectoral Committee, provided that no active Member of the Uganda Peoples Defence Forces shall be designated as Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson of the Committee on Defence and InternalAffairs.”It is common sense. Yes, UPDF? First, designate a Member to the agriculture committee.9146DESIGNATION OF MEMBERS TO SECTORAL COMMITTEES2.46LT COL JENNIFER ALANYO (UPDF Representative):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. In accordance with Rule 187(1) and (2) of the Rules of Procedure, I beg to designate Hon. Maj. Gen Sam Kavuma to the Committee on Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries.THE SPEAKER:  I put the question that the Committee on Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries be constituted as proposed. (Question put and agreed to.)THE SPEAKER:  Defence committee?2.47LT COL JENNIFER ALANYO (UPDF Representative):  Madam Speaker, under the same rule, allow me to present Hon. Lt Gen. Peter Elwelu to the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs. THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. I put the question that the sectoral Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs be constituted as proposed. (Question put and agreed to.)MR SSEMUJJU:  Madam Speaker, earlier, the Government Chief Whip and the Chief Opposition Whip quoted specific rules under which Members were being designated. I know, Madam Speaker – with humility and I am sorry – you may want to help the UPDF. However, I think they should make it easy for you. They could first get out and we find a way because the rule you quoted only stops at appointing them as chairperson and vice-chairperson, but it does not provide for designation.THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Asuman? How did you bring the UPDF to the House?MR BASALIRWA:  Madam Speaker, let us, perhaps, help each other by seeking refuge in Rule 8 of the Rules of Procedure. This House has set a precedent as far as designating members of the UPDF is concerned. In the previous parliaments, designation by the UPDF has been under the discretion and guidance of the Speaker.However, we should regularise the mode of designation under our rules. Otherwise, a precedent has been set. Unfortunately, the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline, has not codified that precedent under our Rules of Procedure.Going forward, to avoid this imbroglio that Hon. Ssemujju is highlighting, I seek your indulgence to have the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline, in reconsidering amendments to these rules, have the mode of designations structured in our rules to avoid what we are witnessing here. Otherwise, as Parliament, we have an obligation to follow that precedent. Thank you. THE SPEAKER:  Is the UPDF an organisation represented in the House? Anyway, we are designating the UPDF and we shall make amendments specific to what Hon. Semujju is talking about. In the absence of that, I will exercise my powers as the Speaker, under rule 8.THE COMMITTEE ON EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY AFFAIRS2.51 THE GOVERNMENT CHIEF WHIP (Mr Hamson Obua):  Madam Speaker, I beg to move under Rule 187(1) of the Rules of Procedure, to designate the following Members to the Committee on East African Community Affairs:1.

MR SSASAGA:  Then I expected this designation to come from the Independents’ whip and not from the other side -THE SPEAKER:  I am the Whip of the independents.All the Independents belong to the Speaker and if Hon. Mapenduzi resigned from being a chairperson on the other side, the House accepted. Maybe this side was generous enough to give him to chair because he is one of the best chairpersons we have. Opposition?MR SSEMUJJU:  Madam Speaker, this Parliament is a serious institution. That is why it is illegal and unconstitutional, until the final year, for Members of Parliament to change affiliation. A Member cannot be with the Opposition today and tomorrow, he is with the NRM. The Constitution says you can only change affiliation during the final year – THE SPEAKER : Has he changed his affiliation? MR SSEMUJJU:  Yes. He was here working with us and now he is being read the other side. (Laughter)   Madam Speaker, you have a duty – THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Ssemujju, you work with me every day; have you changed your affiliation? MR SSEMUJJU:  Madam Speaker, I work with you as the Speaker – THE SPEAKER:  No, you work with – I have actually seen you with the Government Chief Whip. You are always together. Have you changed your affiliation? MR SSEMUJJU : No. We play football together. (Laughter)  THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, Hon. Mapenduzi is an Independent Member of Parliament and so, he chooses where he wants to be. In the 10th Parliament, I was an Independent Member of Parliament and Hon. Ssemujju designated me to COSASE and then chased me away. When he chased me away, I went and got belonging elsewhere. So, for now, Hon. Mapenduzi, congratulations. MR SSEMUJJU:  Madam Speaker, for record purposes, I did not chase you. You voluntarily left. In fact, we were shocked when we saw you with Gen. Museveni – THE SPEAKER:  Can we designate? Maybe Gen.

I will accord the committee chairperson time to report on their findings and what they think we should also do to borrow a leaf. After that, the report will be deposited in the library for everyone’s consumption.4.01THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL INDUSTRY AND FISHERIES (Ms Janet Okori-Moe):  Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I beg to present the Report of the Committee on Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries on the study visit to Kenya on Hass Avocado and Macadamia growing and processing.Madam Speaker, Article 90(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda and rules 156, 159, 187 and 189 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament enjoin committees with the authority and power to, among others, research, investigate and carry out oversight functions with respect to the ministries, departments and agencies –THE SPEAKER:  Please, limit yourself to rule 33. MS OKORI-MOE:  Most obliged, Madam Speaker. Let me go straight to the recommendations and the lessons learnt. These were the lessons that the committee learnt.On sustainability, the committee learnt that most counties in Kenya have chosen avocado as one of the enterprises to support and have included it in their counties’ integrated development plans. Uganda has also adapted it and that is why we have it as one of the priority commodities in the National Development Plan (NDP) III.Madam Speaker, the committee also learnt that smallholder farmers in Kenya – those who own less than two acres of land – account for over 70 per cent of all farming activities, including Hass Avocado. Of course, in Uganda, we have just started. Also, through NAADs, the country has been able to avail Hass Avocado seedlings to potential farmers. Let me go straight to the recommendations. Madam Speaker, the following were the recommendations by the committee:The Government should promote Hass Avocado growing because it is on high demand internationally. The demand for Hass Avocado is growing at a rate of l3 per cent per year, yet the production is growing at only 10 per cent. This represents a gap of 3 per cent between production and demand. Madam Speaker, Hass Avocado farming has environmental benefits as planting more trees helps to battle deforestation, which causes irregular dry seasons, longer drought periods and unpredictable heavy rainfalls.Madam Speaker, the second recommendation by the committee was that the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries – SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORT9163THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 20 JUNE 2023THE SPEAKER:  There is a procedural matter.MS A VUR:  Madam Speaker, I am sorry to rise on a matter of procedure, but this is my maiden speech for this session. I really wish to pay attention, just like other Members, but we are so much inconvenienced by the noise outside. Madam Speaker, is it procedurally right for us to continue this way? Thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Please, go ahead as the whip does his job. MS OKORI-MOE:  Madam Speaker, the other recommendation that the committee came up with is that the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries should inspect and certify nurseries to supply avocado seedlings. This is so because only properly grafted seedlings will give a good yield, according to the findings of the committee.The committee also recommends that the Government should embrace Hass Avocado growing and plan to have nucleus farms and demonstration gardens, preferably at all regional levels in Uganda, so that farmers in the regions are able to access Hass Avocado seedlings.The committee also recommends that the Government should use Hass Avocado farming and marketing as a strategy for job creation and poverty alleviation through value addition. The committee also recommends that the Government should increase the budget, through NAADS and local governments, to increase planting materials, capacity building, storage and value addition.The committee also recommends that the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries should focus on the capacity development of farmers by offering training to farmers and value chain players on aspects of crop management, quality requirements, marketing, processing, finance management and linkages. The committee also recommends that MAAIF should promote reputable partners to minimise failure and sustain the flow of inputs. Farmers should be supported to grow the right varieties for a specific market; That Government should support producer cooperatives to promote the avocado value chain;The committee further recommends that the Government sets up production and marketing standards in line with global marketing standards;Government, through MAAIF should train farmers on how to improve production using older trees in demonstration farms, which are critical in imparting practical skills to farmers for increased production; andMadam Speaker, the committee further recommends that MAAIF should set up post-harvest treatment facilities; quality starts from the farm to the market, and this is so key in ensuring the safe handling of the fruit. The rest of the recommendations are on macadamia, which is also a new crop under the Parish Development Model. And on this, the committee recommends as follows: a) That Government, together with the private sector, should promote Macadamia growing. The crop needs swift action, which the private sector can take up; b) That Government establishes a regulatory body to certify seedlings. While the grafted plant produces a yield in five years, the non-grafted one can take up to 10 years to yield;c) That Government should encourage farmers to belong to groups/associations to avoid exploitation by the middlemen; d) That Government should encourage farmers to use agronomic practices including organic fertilisers, in order to have yields that meet world standards;9164DESIGNATION OF MEMBERS TO SECTORAL COMMITTEESe) That Government develops conducive policies to encourage the private sector to invest in the Macadamia industry; andf) That Government should provide assorted subsidised inputs to farmers to increase production. The committee also made some cross-cutting observations, which are stated as follows:1. That many Ugandans attempting to enter into the Hass Avocado and Macadamia growing business are finding it difficult to buy and access the expensive seedlings. A seedling of Hass Avocado is sold at between Shs 5,000 and 8,000, which is high for an ordinary Ugandan. An acre requires 166 seedlings, which translates into Shs 830,000 per acre for planting; many farmers may not afford; and2. That some farmers are reported to be plucking the top parts of the trees to graft them with local Avocado. This is more lucrative than selling the actual fruit. Furthermore, one cannot plant the seed of the harvested Avocado because it would not produce an actual avocado.Finally, Madam Speaker, the committee recommends that:a)  Government should subsidise the price of Hass Avocado and Macadamia seedlings to make them viable to farmers since the market price of these seedlings is largely unaffordable;b) Government should set up regional nurseries and processing centers nearer to the farmer to facilitate market access and reduce losses from perishability; and c) Government should promote the export market to enhance our national and international competitiveness in Hass Avocado and Macadamia fruits.Madam Speaker, a copy of this report is in the library. And for Members, it was uploaded on your iPads; you can access it and act accordingly. Please lead by example by growing Hass Avocado and Macadamia. I beg to submit. (Applause)THE SPEAKER:  Thank you very much, committee chairperson. The report is very clear. What the committee is saying is that this is a lucrative business that you should go for and lead by example. You will not debate here on how to get the seedlings in addition to other things; go and plant avocados and act as an example to your locals. Please encourage them to plant Hass Avocados. (Applause)  As I speak, I have planted over 100 acres of Hass Avocado. (Applause)  I learnt of it when they came back from their trip. So, Professor, just go and plant Hass Avocados – (Laughter) - the report is in the library.Next item.REPORT OF THE DELEGATION TO THE UNITED NATIONS 2023 WATER CONFERENCE IN NEW YORK 22ND – 24TH MARCH 2023THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, this report, like any other reports, is going to be presented under rule 33 by Hon.

I hereby lay a report pertaining to that and it is titled, “Report of the Delegation to the United Nations 2023 Water Conference in New York held from 22 to 24 March 2023.” THE SPEAKER:  Thank you.

The Minister of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development is going to lay it on the table.4.15THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi):  Madam Speaker, I beg to lay on the Table the Financial Institutions (Revision of Minimum Capital Requirements) Instrument, 2022.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. Pursuant to Rule 31(5) of the Rules of Procedure, the statutory instrument is referred to the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development and it should be considered as soon as possible.THE MICRO-FINANCE DEPOSIT-TAKING INSTITUTIONS (REVISION OFMINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS) INSTRUMENT, 20224.16THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi):  Madam Speaker, I beg to lay, on the Table the Microfinance Deposit-Taking Institutions (Revision of Minimum Capital Requirements) Instrument, 2022. THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. This is still referred to the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development for expeditious consideration and report back to the House.SUPPLEMENTARY SCHEDULE NO.1 FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2022/2023THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, as you may recall, on 27 April 2023, the House supplied expenditure, but part B was left; that is the 3 per cent. Therefore, pursuant to Article 156 of the Constitution, Section 25 of the Public Finance Management Act, and Rule 154 of the Rules of Procedure, we will consider this as a retrospective expenditure. The money was already spent; you approved part of the supplementary and left part of it. Next time, reject the whole schedule. Do not do things piecemeal. We are even at Committee Stage. Now that we are at the Committee Stage, we are going back to the committee.I would like to ask the Clerk to ensure that all the documents, figures, items, and votes are captured on the Hansard  because it is money spent already.We are going to supply a block figure because I am not going to start reading something that was spent when one part of the same item was passed. So, we are going to supply and have the item passed. Government Chief Whip, can we have your team go outside?BILLSCOMMITTEE STAGETHE COMMITTEE OF SUPPLYRecurrent Expenditure under Supplementary Schedule No.1 for the Financial Year 2022/2023, a total amount of Shs 874,339,200,924THE CHAIRPERSON:  I put the question that the total sum that has been read be considered as recurrent expenditure for Supplementary Schedule No.1 for the Financial Year 2022/2023.(Question put and agreed to.)MR ODUR:  Madam Speaker, I would like to seek your guidance.  When this House considered what, at the time, was baptized as Part B of the schedule, I raised a question of whether it was actually proper, at that stage, to segregate a schedule, and deal with some parts, but leave the other. 9166DESIGNATION OF MEMBERS TO SECTORAL COMMITTEESAt that time, the presiding officer, in his wisdom, said that it was correct. Now that we are processing this, I want to understand what happens to the part that we passed. Are we amending it? Was a new supplementary, an addendum, and a schedule introduced so we can have proper anchorage, in terms of the legislation we are dealing with?Secondly, the House cannot run away from dealing with any matter the Executive brings; whether we like it or not. However, Madam Speaker, I would like to request you to guide us on something. When you say that this supplementary has already been expended and we are not going to change anything, is it a correct position that this House is – otherwise, another supplementary will come? As a Member of Parliament, may I know if I have no role to play when a supplementary is tabled here? Let me address you on the questions of law regarding the 3 per cent. I believe I am backed by that law that it is not correct that the Government has unfettered powers to expend the 3 per cent limit. If we are dealing with retrospective approval, the conditions must be satisfied. One, that expenditure must have been lawful. If it was not lawful and it was expended on something that violates the law, it falls squarely. Further, that expenditure must be justified to the extent that if Parliament was actually sitting and deliberating on it, it would ordinarily pass it.Lastly, the expenditure must have been incurred. There are some items that are here, but which have not yet been incurred. The minister just wants to mislead this House as if it has been expended.Madam Speaker, this is very dangerous; it is dangerous for the minister to mislead this House that they have already spent. If I am to challenge the minister on this; I can point them out. I just do not want to open it, but I can. The minister should tell us that the purported 3 per cent was not actually spent.THE CHAIRPERSON:  Honourable minister, I am not allowing debate on this. Honourable members, we are completing what was started. This is why when we were passing the Appropriation Act, we passed only what was at that time. MR MUSASIZI:  Madam Chairperson, I would like to address my mind to the first issue that the Hon. Odur raised regarding the fact that the House decided to pass Part B of the Supplementary Expenditure Schedule No.1 for the Financial Year 2022/2023 and left out Part A, which was within the 3 per cent. On the question of what happens, I presented to this Parliament one schedule, which was categorised into two: Part A of the expenditures, which were within the 3 per cent, and Part B, which was over and above the 3 per cent and required Parliamentary approval.What we are doing now has this effect: if Parliament approves Part A of the 3 per cent, we shall consolidate it with Part B and have a full schedule regularised by Parliament. Thank you.THE CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. Let us move on to the development expenditure.MR ODUR:  Madam Chairperson, I want the Executive to also clarify on the provisions of Article 159(5) and (6) of the Constitution, Sections 39 and 40 of the Public Finance Management, Act and Rule 155 of our Rules of Procedure. Regarding the loan figure, the above provisions state that where the Government intends to lend or borrow, it must be moved on a separate motion and that motion should be referred to a relevant committee. In this supplementary, there is a figure the Government intends to lend out. The terms and conditions of the lending have not been brought to this House. The repayment schedule has not been brought to this House. These are matters of law and they are very clear. SUPPLEMENTARY SCHEDULE NO.1 FOR FY 2022/2023 [Mr Odur]9167THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 20 JUNE 2023Madam Speaker, should we proceed and purport to ratify this lending when this House has not followed it is own rules?Also, the chairperson of the committee presented a report here and that report was adopted. In the report, there were expenditures the committee rejected and we adopted that report already. The House already adopted that report with those recommendations rejecting certain provisions. So, how come that at the end, we just proceed to approve the schedule as it is yet this House sat and actually approved the recommendations in the report? Aren’t we now shooting ourselves or hanging ourselves actually that after we have approved, we again turn around and do something else? Madam Speaker, I want to persuade you to the point that at least at the very minimum, the figures that the Committee on Budget had rejected should not be part of this because the House already decided on those.THE CHAIRPERSON:  Let me hear from the minister.MR MUSASIZI:  Madam Chairperson, what we are seeking approval for now, are the expenditures, which we incurred within the 3 per cent. We have gone back and forth, as we laboured to explain. However, our prayer is that the House approves this schedule as we presented it because the money is already spent on activities, which are known. I would like to persuade this House to approve the 3 per cent as presented to you. MR MUWANGA KIVUMBI:  Madam Chairperson, I thank you for this opportunity. First, spending the money does not take away our obligation to approve because the Constitution is very clear; that for any item to enter the Appropriation Bill, it must be approved by Parliament. Therefore, our duty at this moment is to ensure that much as the PFMA gives the minister powers to spend under 3 per cent, the firewall to examine and ensure that that the money did the purpose for which it was intended and that there is value for money, is with this House. That is why we are enjoined with special powers at this moment to reject any figure that we feel does not meet the standards set by the PFMA on what a supplementary should be.In the wisdom of the Committee on Budget, we looked at various items and found certain items where the minister did not follow the law. He actually abused the law, and he has been doing it with impunity. I have been here for quite some time and in the Committee on Budget, and I can say that each year, we close our eye and say the minister gets away with it, but this cannot be forever. There comes a time when Parliament must exercise its powers to curtail this impunity, and this is the day. That is why I concur with Hon. Jonathan that at least, at the bare minimum - I questioned many items in my minority report, which was adopted – where even the majority report concurred with the minority that these items should not be included at this time. This will give Parliament a good standing and history will judge us fairly.THE CHAIRPERSON:  Can we hear from the chairperson of the committee? However, before that, honourable members, I advised Hon. Kivumbi last time to bring an amendment to help us know what we should spend within that 3 per cent. This will help us to regulate. Otherwise, if we leave it open the way it is - the law is not there to say, “Spend on this and spend on that.” Let us bring an amendment; you had promised to bring it. MR MUWANGA KIVUMBI:  Madam Chairperson, I have already drafted the motion. It is with your office. We are only waiting for you to allocate us time. Even if today you want me to seek leave of Parliament, I am ready for it. THE CHAIRPERSON:  Bring and seek leave after we have passed this.9168DESIGNATION OF MEMBERS TO SECTORAL COMMITTEESMR MUWANGA KIVUMBI:  However, that being the case, we cannot cover this impunity simply because we are going to amend the law.MR OBOTH:  The Constitution provides for you to prescribe any punishments - and, I think the Hon. Basalirwa will agree with me - the law should define and specify it.I want to seek clarification from Hon. Kivumbi. We may not like what the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development is doing, but then we acknowledge that there is a need for amendment. The guidance of the honourable chairperson of this House is that there is a need to specify what this money - the 3 per cent - is supposed to be spent on so that it is not only left to the minister to choose what to spend on. Therefore, wouldn’t it be fair to resolve the ambiguity in favour of the misbehaving minister - if you want to say so - so that until a specific amendment is made, we would not have the liberty and latitude to sanction, but to be fair to ourselves that we can be much more cordial. This will help us to stop this by bringing a specific provision that would really help. I thought this should go through the microphone, but I share in your concerns.THE CHAIRPERSON:  Honourable mem -bers - I want to plead with the House - what is being raised is very critical. Much as we have given you the latitude to spend within the 3 per cent, you should able to know how to spend it. Do not spend on what has been rejected; spend on what has value for money. What Hon. Odur raised is very important. We need to check ourselves. However, even when doing so, this is the first supplementary I am passing. Hon. Kivumbi, I am pleading with you. Let us pass this supplementary. We will not pass the next if they do not do what the House requires. I have said this is something that has been on-going. We have had meetings almost every day with the shadow minister. We agreed that as we begin the Session, we pass this thing and start on a clean note.MR MUWANGA KIVUMBI:  Madam Chairperson, I think even the law as it is – Article 156 for which my learned  friend – no, I won’t call him a learned  friend; I have never been to law school –(Interjections)  – I was there to only see you. Anyway, the Constitution is very clear before you even go to the Act because it spells out that under the 3 per cent – actually, there is no 3 per cent in the Constitution - for any money that is spent, Parliament will have to approve.Madam Chairperson, the dilemma is that Parliament spoke in a budget process and rejected expenditure items and told the minister for finance: “Don’t go ahead and spend this money.” However, on day one of July, they went ahead and disregarded the decision of Parliament. Even when we want to be human and appeal – and this is not the first. It has happened over and over, and it has now stretched our sympathy beyond the point of satiety and we are saying enough is enough. Therefore, we stand firmly to reject any expenditure that the majority committee rejected. I am willing to compromise on the expenditures, which I had objected to, and accept that we go with the uniform decisions of the Committee on Budget and of the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development, that all expenditures, which were rejected by the majority report, should not be included in the Appropriation Act. And my friend, the law speaks volumes about what to do: that officer will be held personally responsible for the loss even when he has left office.THE CHAIRPERSON:  We have heard. MR BASALIRWA:  Madam Speaker, Hon. Muwanga Kivumbi indicated that the motion is ready. However, I am concerned, Madam Speaker, because there are reports that we read, arising out of the NRM retreat, to the effect that they will no longer support Private Members’ motions.

(Question put and agreed to.)(The House resumed, the Speaker, presiding_)REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY4.43THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi):  Madam Speaker, I beg to report that the Committee of Supply has considered the Supplementary Schedule No.1, Part A, under the 3 per cent, and passed it with no amendments.MOTION FOR ADOPTION OF THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY4.43MR MUHAMMAD MUWANGA KIVUMBI (NUP, Butambala County, Butambala): Madam Speaker, on a point of procedure, I move to recommit – and I appeal to this House for a re-committal. My re-committal is on two items: the Shs 274.9 billion for Atiak and Shs 48 billion for Munyonyo. If you permit me, the reasons are very clear. Madam Speaker, we have given Atiak a colossal sum of money, now amounting to over Shs 600 billion. However, to the dismay of this country – and I have reports from the MPs who come from that part of the country – there is nothing to show that there is value for money. We have hemorrhaged this country to that extent. 9170DESIGNATION OF MEMBERS TO SECTORAL COMMITTEESI did a survey and realised that Mr Abid Alam set up a sugar factory and a sugar plantation at a cost of $52 million. However, here we are pumping almost Shs 600 billion with no single bag of sugar coming from Atiak Sugar Factory yet that factory gets the first call on every V ote under the 3 per cent. So, I want to move that for us to help this country, going forward, we exclude the money for Atiak and the Shs 48 billion for Munyonyo. The other day I was in Munyonyo. If you look at the small plot of land that has been sold to the Government of Uganda – our children will ask what we were doing and what kind of House sat and approved that money. That is why, I beg you, Madam Speaker, that I move a motion to recommit. THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, Hon. Kivumbi is moving a motion that we - you second it.4.46MR IBRAHIM SSEMUJJU (FDC, Kira Municipality, Wakiso):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. Parliament approved the money for the construction of a hospital in Lubowa. We were almost at gunpoint because we were being told that they had already made a commitment with Pinetti -THE SPEAKER:  Did you see a gun here?MR SSEMUJJU: I am using the meaning in the language -THE SPEAKER:  Let us use parliamentary language.MR SSEMUJJU: Madam Speaker,  I am looking at the meaning in the language that I am using. Then, we have another lady in Atiak, Amina. Maybe Parliament should interest itself in finding out the relationship of the President, who is proposing these sums of money, with these women – (Interruption) MR OBOTH:  Madam Speaker, are we proceeding well when you have a motion for recommittal ably put by Hon. Kivumbi to have the alleged seconder actually debating it? THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, Hon. Muwanga Kivumbi is saying that we should recommit and remove the money. I am going to put the question to this proposal and if you are not in favour of the recommittal, say, “Nay.” Are we together?Honourable members, I put the question that this House recommits two expenditure items as proposed by Hon. Muwanga Kivumbi. (Question put and negatived.)MOTION FOR ADOPTION OF THE REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE ON SUPPLY4.48THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (General Duties) Mr Henry Musasizi):  Madam Speaker, I beg to move a motion that the Report from the Committee of Supply be adopted.THE SPEAKER:  I put the question that the House adopts the Report of the Committee of Supply.
