PRAYERS

(The Speaker, Mr Edward Ssekandi, in the Chair.)

The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you and again I want to thank you for the good performance yesterday; the House was fully attended and I hope within a minute or so we will have realized the same strength.  

Honourable members, in the Distinguished Strangers’ Gallery we have a delegation of members of the Network of African Ministers and Parliamentarians, Malawi Chapter, and the composition of this delegation is as follows: Hon. Joyce Banda, Minister of Gender, Child Welfare and Community Service; you are welcome -(Applause)- three Members of Parliament, and two government officials have accompanied her.  

Their area of interest is to learn strategies from Uganda that increase women’s participation in politics and decision-making. I hope we shall be of use in identifying and addressing the gender gaps that limit women’s participation in politics and decision-making, and to be able to contribute and inform the constitutional review currently going on in Malawi and in a nutshell share experiences between Malawi and Uganda. You are most welcome to Uganda, and have an amicable stay. (Applause)

10.59
THE MINISTER OF STATE, INTERNAL AFFAIRS (Dr Kezimbira Miyingo): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to give information about two issues that were raised yesterday:

One is the issue of payment of salaries for Police officers. I have inquired from the hierarchy of the Police and from some of the police officers. The salaries have partially been paid; most of the police officers have received their salaries, especially those receiving their salaries from the main Stanbic Bank. But there are some salaries, which are not yet paid and the discrepancy, I have been informed, could be the change in the financial year. This is being sorted out to make sure that they all receive their salaries.

Secondly, is to correct the information that was given by hon. Zziwa. Even if I notified her that we referred the matter of the boda boda cyclist to the committee, it is not true that the Deputy Inspector General of Police and his colleague, Mr Turyagumanawe, gave information to hon. Zziwa that the body of the boda boda cyclist had been recovered. The information that they gave to hon. Zziwa was that the two bodies of the children who were also washed away during those rains were recovered in Makindye Division and handed over to the parents of the children.  

I also want to say that the Police will go ahead with the investigations regardless of whether Kampala City Council hires a private investigator or not. That is the information I wanted to give, Mr Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much.

THE CHAIRPERSON, EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES COMMITTEE (Mrs Dora Byamukama): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to join you and Members of this Parliament in welcoming our colleagues from Malawi, and to note that Uganda has done a lot of work in addressing the issue of gender gaps, especially in political participation.  

Linked to this particular subject is the issue of the rights of the family. As you may recall, in June the Government tabled the Domestic Relations Bill and said that more consultations should have been held on this particular issue. Under your wise guidance, Mr Speaker, Parliament directed that the Government should table the Domestic Relations Bill on the 15th of August 2005, which was yesterday. Yesterday I waited patiently. When I saw the Order Paper I thought that maybe there might be some alteration to include it but I got perturbed - even when I look at the Order Paper of today, in the notice of business to follow there is no mention of this very important Bill, which will address issues of women’s rights and rights of the family.  

It does not only address women’s rights but it also addresses men’s rights and it is a very important law in that, for example it talks about the age of marriage being set at 18 years, it talks about issues of property within marriage and it talks about issues of co-habitation. Mr Speaker, as you rightly commented, the Divorce Act was challenged in the Constitutional Court and, therefore, this particular Act has gaps. There is a lacuna in the law, which makes it very difficult for members of the legal profession as well as the Judiciary to use it effectively in issues of separation and divorce. So I would like to ask the Government to respond to our request concretely and let the Domestic Relations Bill be reinstated on the notice of business to follow. I thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Yesterday the Chairperson of UWOPA, hon. Amajo, raised this issue and asked the minister. I am the one who gave him the date of 15th August 2005 but he gave the reason he was not able to make it yesterday and promised that very soon he is going to make a statement on this issue. Perhaps next week he will make a statement on the position as far as the Government is concerned because I think as you appreciate, we were proceeding with the Bill but due to the many queries that arose, including demonstrations and petitions, it was found necessary to make further inquiries to find out what was missing, what we can remove and what we can put in. 

Certain government agencies were commissioned to do this work, the Uganda Law Reform Commission by Prof. Kakooza is doing this and it is making contacts with aggrieved parties so that something acceptable comes out. However, the Minister, hon. Adolf Mwesige yesterday promised to give their position soon.  

11.09
MR AGGREY AWORI (Samia-Bugwe County North, Busia): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Permit me to raise a matter, which might appear to be administrative and yet concerns your safety and security. From time to time in the past I have raised the issue of a canopy over the bridge connecting this Chamber and your wing. It is dangerous to walk on that bridge after it has rained.  

I also note again that the lift, which we use in the North wing, there are times when I enter and find water settled on the base, which means it can cause electrocution. We are worried about your safety –(Laughter)- for me immediately I see water, I will not enter. But you, Mr Speaker, your bodyguards and other people might just lead you in without any caution. So, as the Chairman of the Commission, money should be allocated immediately to cause the water not to enter the lift and also to provide a canopy so that you do not get wet when you are coming from your wing to the main Chamber. Please, I beg you; we are interested in your safety. 

THE SPEAKER: I am greatly touched by your –(Laughter)- concern about my safety and the safety of others from the other wing. Actually, we have considered this matter of a canopy on the two bridges and we worked out with the technical people. We worked out the figures through the Ministry of Works and the only problem is capital development that is required so that we can fix the canopy that you are talking about. 

About the lifts, it is true that sometimes water goes through and it has been our concern. We are trying to see how soon we can fix the leakages so that this does not happen that the Speaker’s life is not endangered. I thank you very much.

MINISTERIAL STATEMENT

THE SPEAKER: Well, as you may understand, this ministerial statement is going to come, but it is relevant to Dorcus Inzikuru, whom we had expected to come here this morning but according to the programme, she will be here in the afternoon since she arrived at midnight and spent the night in Entebbe. There are a number of programmes arranged for her.  

So what I propose is that we proceed with other items up to afternoon. When she comes I will suspend the proceedings for a few minutes to receive her and make some representation on your behalf to her. That is when we will enter again and the ministerial statement will be made, because it is relevant to Dorcus Inzikuru.

You are most welcome to Parliament and we are happy to receive you. Congratulations upon your achievement.

Honourable members, on the Order Paper it was stated that there would be a statement by the Minister of Education. However it is going to be a motion. So, can we adjust the Order Paper so that it reads likewise?

MOTION TO RECOGNIZE THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF DORCUS IZINKURU

2.44
THE MINISTER OF STATE, SPORTS (Mr Charles Bakkabulindi): Mr Speaker, I beg to move a motion for a resolution of Parliament of the Republic of Uganda to pay glowing tribute and appropriate recognition to Ms Dorcus Inzikuru for her superb and excellent performance in winning the ultimate sporting prize of a precious gold medal for Uganda in the 3,000 meters women steeple chase in the just concluded World Athletics Championships in Helsinki, Finland. (Applause)

AN HON. MEMBER: Seconded.

MR BAKKABULINDI: “WHEREAS during the just concluded 10th World Athletics Championships in Helsinki, Finland, Uganda entered yet again into the annals of world class athletics when Ms Dorcus Inzikuru won a gold medal on the 8th day of August, 2005 in the inaugural women’s 3,000 meters steeple chase at a record time of 9 minutes, 18.24 seconds – (Applause)- thereby earning Uganda once again, tremendous pride;

COGNISANT of the fact that the only other gold medal earned in an international arena by another Ugandan hero was about 33 years ago in the 1972 Munich Olympic Games when the late John Akii Bua won the 400 meters hurdles event;

AWARE that a number of Ugandan sportsmen and athletes have continued to glorify the image of this country by acquiring various medals and/or recognition by their respective achievements in various fields of sports;

CONSCIOUS that it is the Government policy and that a precedent has been set by the Parliament of Uganda to appropriately and timely honour and recognize all those Ugandans who have deservedly excelled in various fields of human endeavour, including sports;

AWARE FURTHER that Ms Dorcus Inzikuru has emphatically and deservedly excelled in the field of sports generally and athletics specifically to the level of attracting international attention and repute, to the extent of getting all the sporting fraternity in the athletics arena and indeed the whole world at large to stand up at attention in honour of the Uganda National Anthem;

NOW, THEREFORE, at its 35th Sitting of the First Meeting of the Fifth Session of the Seventh Parliament, sitting in Kampala this 16th day of August 2005 at Parliament House, it is hereby resolved as follows:

1.	That Parliament collectively congratulates and thereafter pays glowing tribute to Ms Dorcus Inzikuru’s tremendous international achievement for herself, family, team members, colleagues, athletes, coach and manager and the nation at large –(Applause)
2.	That Parliament formally registers recognition of the great honour and pride that the said Ms Dorcus Inzikuru has earned especially the country and people of Uganda –(Applause)
3.	That Parliament urges other potentially talented Ugandans, especially the youth to emulate the example set by the said Ms Dorcus Inzikuru as an accomplished athlete, lover and marketer of sports generally –(Applause)
4.	That Parliament urges the private sector to continue its support and contribution to the sustainable development of sports generally and athletics specifically, in supplement to Government (public) appropriations towards sports by establishing and contributing to a specific sports vote;
5.	That Parliament collectively registers recognition of the benefits of Physical Education and Sports to individuals, citizens and the nation at large and therefore urges Government to recognize and fund Physical Education and Sports development as a national commitment.”

Mr Speaker and honourable members, I beg to move.

2.49
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs Dorothy Hyuha): Mr Speaker and honourable members, as the Chairperson of the Social Services Committee where the sports sub-sector falls, I stand to support the motion moved by the Minister of State for Education and Sports.

I am happy and proud to associate myself with this great young Ugandan lady, Inzikuru, who became the first Ugandan woman to win a gold medal in international sports. (Applause) As you have heard from the motion, for the last 33 years after the late John Akii Bua won a gold medal in 1972, it is only now in 2005 that Inzikuru has put us again on the international map.  

Inzikuru, I must emphasis that I am happy and proud that you have added value to our country Uganda – (Applause)– and above all to us the women of Uganda. (Applause) We sincerely thank you and appreciate the personal efforts you have invested. 

I must recognize your parents who have accompanied you and thank them for investing in you -(Interjection)- the minister is reminding me that even Inzikuru junior will become a sports lady or gentleman. Mr Speaker and honourable members, I wish to thank the Ministry of Education that has introduced the quota system for students to be supported by the Government in public universities. The quota covers three areas that include the district quota, one for the sportsmen and women and the third for persons with disabilities.  

As we were reliably informed in the Committee on Social Services and Parliament, this academic year we expect 40 slots for sportsmen and women, 20 of which are for women and the other 20 for men regardless of the sports discipline. We commend the Government for this positive effort to recognize the sports sub-sector.

As we received this great young lady this afternoon and I looked at her, it was my special appeal that if Inzikuru has never attained a degree it should be through this system that the Government supports her so that she can also attain one. (Applause) I am certain that with time age will catch up with her such that she will no longer be very active in competitions. Therefore, she needs to have other avenues of earning a living. Since we recognize the amount of time sportsmen and women invest into their sport, it is high time that we recognized Inzikuru’s case and I specially appeal to the education sector to look into the academic status of Inzikuru. Since we recognize sports men and women the time they invest in, it is high time we recognized Inzikuru.

But at an appropriate time I will remind the education sector because in this particular policy we only recognize sports men and women at the university level. What happens to those at lower levels? For quite some time we have had primary children who spend most of the time out of school, they are on county competition sports; they are in district competition; they are in national competitions. You may find that a child has spent a full month out of station. When she comes back to school she may not catch up. This could have happened to Inzikuru. I am reliably informed that she may have not gone beyond A’ Level.  So, it is a challenge to the ministry to specially support Inzikuru and many others so that she can catch up through this special policy to attain her academic career as well. (Applause)

I wish to emphasize that over the last years the sports sub-sector in the Ministry of Education and Sports has faced quite a number of challenges. Among other challenges includes the lack of sports policy, the gross under funding, the outdated laws and the thin structure of staff. When you go to the Ministry of Education and Sports, whereas we have a Minister of State in charge of Sports, it is the only sub-sector where we do not have other staff like a commissioner in charge of planning; a commissioner in charge of primary education; a Commissioner in charge of higher education. What is the problem? That is a challenge.

During the financial year 2002/2003 the Committee on Social Services had recommended that Parliament do not approve the budget of the Ministry of Sports unless the following year they produced a sports policy. I want to use this opportunity as we recognize Inzikuru to put it on record that now the Ministry of Education and Sports has a sports policy, which has been our major concern. We want to commend the Ministry of Education for this achievement.  

However, this policy has to go hand in hand with the funding. The sports policy should be supported with the funding. I want to make special appeal to government through the Leader of Government Business, if you looked in this sports policy, which you approved, one of the areas of emphasis is that government is committed to providing an appropriate budget for sports and to cater for the educational component as well as for the national sportsmen and women who are the flag bearers of the nation.
  
I am certain that if we had adequate funding and investment we could see many of the Inzikuru potential talents, which we are not tapping, downwards. I want to emphasize that it is high time we recognised the sports sub-sector as one our key priorities because we have seen that if we invested in it we would have the international recognition, which Inzikuru has made us feel very proud of.

As I conclude, once again I am happy as a Ugandan woman. I am happy as I face the lady minister and also as a lady chairperson to see this pride in this country. Inzikuru, you have really earned us value and the Government should invest in sports so that many sports women and men do not leave this challenge to only the private sector but consider sports as a priority. I beg to support the motion. (Applause)

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, we have only 30 minutes on this. We shall close the debate after 30 minutes. Therefore, whoever has got an opportunity must be very brief. 

3.00
MS ROSE NAMAYANJA (Youth Representative, Central): I thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I want to add my voice to those of my colleagues to congratulate Dorcus Inzikuru and Uganda for this achievement. 

For the young people who were born after 1972,it is their first time they are witnessing a gold medal for Uganda. Indeed for those young people we feel this is a great achievement and we are witnessing it for the first time. 

I want to congratulate Dorcus Inzikuru, first of all, for the discipline. In sports discipline on and off the pitch is very important. Basing on what we have read in the press about her career, I believe if she did not exhibit high-level discipline she could not win this medal for herself and for Uganda.

I want to also thank her for the level of patriotism. When she got this gold medal she was interviewed and she was asked what she will use the money for. I want to quote her verbatim. She said, “I plan to build a house, but I would really like to help my fellow athletes. I want to bring on the teenage girls. I will be an old woman so I want others to follow me.” (Applause) 

For a person of her age after getting this money - of course she has mentioned the house she would have mentioned so many other things but she said, “I want to bring on board other teenage girls to follow me”. I want to thank her for that.

However, Mr Speaker, I must also add that this achievement has been almost made single-handedly. She has done it on her own with a few supporters here and there. Since there has not been a deliberate government intervention to support sports in this country to a level that you could get many Inzikuru’s today - I am saying this because the boxers did not even have funds to go for the Commonwealth atonement. They were supposed to go there but they did not go and many of the medals we have got, which may not necessarily be gold, have been from the boxing fraternity where we have seen people like Godfrey Nyakana and Ayub Kalule. So, I am just calling upon the Government to increase funding for sports in this country. These sports men and women are acting as our ambassadors. I am saying this because the National Council of Sports, which is in charge of sports in this country, their funding has dwindled from Shs 1 billion in 1991 to Shs 480 million in this financial year. So, Shs 480 million cannot do much for sports in this country.  

I want also to concur with the honourable minister and call upon the private sector to come in and support many of our disciplines. I also want to add that in 1972 when John Akii Bua worn a gold medal he was given a house by the Government, he was given a Peugeot 604 by the Government, and he was promoted to Assistant Superintendent of Police. So, I want to add that government first of all provides education for Dorcus Inzikuru. (Applause)

Secondly, the Government should provide a house for Dorcus Inzikuru -(Applause)- and government should provide a car for Dorcus Inzikuru. I am amending a motion to that effect because this will motivate the many young boys and girls who have a career in sports. I want to end by saying this is the time we want to recognize their support. Because when John Akii Bua died -(Interruptions)- I want to conclude by amending the motion on the Floor to the effect that the Government provides a car, a house and education for Inzikuru. I thank you so much.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I am quite aware that a number of you have seconded the motion but at the same time I am aware that a number of you actually spoke last time. So if you see me skipping you, I am aware you made your contribution already. I said this debate will end in 30 minutes time so I am limiting the speeches.

3.05
DR KAPKWOMU NDIWA (Kongasis County, Kapchorwa): I thank you, Mr Speaker. I join the rest of my colleagues in thanking Inzikuru for having put the Ugandan name on the world map. I am not going to concentrate much on the lamentation we had last week, I may just spend a bit of it in congratulating her and maybe giving the way forward.  

Miss Inzikuru, Uganda is very proud of you after so many years since Akii Bua brought the first gold medal to Uganda. That goes specifically to thanking your parents for really bringing you up very nicely -(Applause)- that shows that you are quite obedient to them and they saw that you could be of very much profit to them. Please, the programme is so big. I encourage you to keep up. 

May I also thank the team manager and the coach for actually allowing you all that time to go to school and do other things and that merely means it is more-or-less private sector. As my colleagues have said, government should actually come in.  

May I also take this opportunity to thank some of the athletes who escorted Miss Inzikuru, that is, Mr kiprop Boniface and Mr Alex Malinga. I should say that I am very glad about the management of Standard High School, particularly to Mr Nuwagaba, who has really assisted in training these young men single-handedly and he has gone to the extent of educating them. Last week I said government should actually take over from him this time because these are people going to the university. A talent is an inborn thing and it is only the environment, which revolves and modifies it by way of training, by way of facilitating and whatsoever.  

The honourable member has actually prayed for financing. May use this chance to request the Ministry of Finance to come to the rescue of the Ministry of Sports and make sure that there is some funding, which will assist these people whose talent is just coming on its own and yet government does not aid them. I am very much aware that the training facilities are very poor, but all the same we still have these people coming up. Can the Ministry of Finance please fund the training camp, which has been proposed in the highlands of Mt Elgon, specifically where Malinga comes from?

Mr Speaker and honourable members, what is the future of our athletes? Tomorrow we shall forget all about Inzikuru. Members have said she should at least be considered for some other items. I add on top of that when she retires something substantial should be added, be it pension or something of that nature at least to keep that person going. My colleagues in the medical field will know that there are certain effects at old age when you are no longer participating in sports. So a medical fee should actually be considered to that extent.

I should emphasize again that we should actually tap the talent, which is still hidden in the villages. Bukwa District is a factory of athletes. The top three athletes on long distance come from Bukwa district. There is a lot lying behind there. There is one who is going to challenge Kiprop beyond no doubt within one year’s time. So, I request that we actually go upcountry, not necessarily Kapchorwa alone, but throughout the country. May I also emphasize that we should revive the office of the district sports officer so that it can actually assist the Ministry of State for Sports? I thank you, Mr Speaker.

3.09
THE MINISTER OF STATE, YOUTH AND CHILD AFFAIRS (Mr Felix Okot): Mr Speaker, as a Minister for young people and children, I want to inform members and the entire House that Dorcus Inzikuru has brought us honour. She has brought us pride and total excitement. On behalf of the young people of this country, the youth, I would like to pay glowing tribute to our sister, Dorcus Inzikuru. Congratulations! (Applause)

The achievement of Dorcus Inzikuru is a big statement. It is a statement that young people can perform wonders and bring glory to this country. (Applause) It is a statement that as Government, as Members of Parliament, we need to give more attention to young people because they are the future of this nation.  

I know we have little time but I want to make three statements here. One statement is that young people are the future of this country and as a country we need to invest in them. There is a lot of talent rotting down in the villages. It is high time that talent was tapped.

I would also like to appeal to the entire youth that the achievement of our sister Inzikuru is a challenge to all of us and we need to emulate her and also achieve what she has done for this country. We must celebrate her achievement because her achievement is for the glory of our country. As a minister for young people, I am even bursting with the pride because the young person brings this pride. As a minister for young people I want you to watch me when I walk out this evening. I will walk with a lot of pride and pomp. I think this time it is not only the minister to bounce around but also the entire youth should celebrate and the celebration will be if they take on the task that is ahead of us.  

As government we need to invest in education of our young people. It is only through education that we can empower our young people. Our young people are not harnessing their talents because of poverty. Many of our young people are poor down there, there are walloping in poverty. So it is high time that we worked hard to eradicate poverty among our young people. 

As I end I would like to congratulate our sister, Dorcus Inzikuru, for her excellent performance. I congratulate you.

3.13
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING (Mr Isaac Musumba): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I want to join the entire country and all other Members of Parliament here present in congratulating Dorcus Inzikuru for the honour she has brought to this country. The image of Uganda has tremendously benefited from the contribution of Dorcus Inzikuru in terms of investment, tourism and many other things that people will now associate or have started associating with this country. So we thank you Inzikuru for being an able daughter of this country.  

The resources that are available –(Interjections)- if members may allow me - the resources that are available to address our sports promotion requirements are obviously inadequate. However, it is important to send a strong signal to the entire country, to the sportsmen and women of this country that we in Parliament and Government are not unmindful or are not unappreciative of the extra mile that these people put in to be able to make this contribution to the country. 

I just want to propose, Sir, in keeping with the provisions set out in the motion as follows. One, that this House sets up an Inzikuru gold medal Parliamentary fund to which we as Members of Parliament will make our contribution and pass on this contribution as an extra support to the Inzikuru effort for her to be able to earn more medals for this country and make this country proud. To that effect I will make my contribution to this fund of not less than Shs 500,000. Other members are invited to contribute.

MR EKANYA: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Hon. Isaac Musumba is a Minister in the Ministry of Finance. We Members of Parliament would be very happy to hear him stating here that he Ministry of Finance is going to waive tax on the income of lady Inzikuru. We would like him to state here on the Floor that the Government will not tax this humble income of this young lady.

MR MUSUMBA: Mr Speaker, had the honourable member allowed me to continue his concerns we would have been answered without having to – the second point I want to make is the private sector contribution and then I will go to the Government sector contribution. 

The private sector contribution: we want to encourage the private sector to make a contribution towards sports as a whole. We would also want to be comforted that the stories we read everyday of embezzlement and poor fund management within the sports management group in the private sector are history. Because those stories of mismanagement of finances in the sports sector among the private sector that administers sports are disheartening to some of us who would want to make a contribution in the private sector.

Finally, unfortunately under the law a gold medal was earned in this country in 1972 that is over 30 years ago. The law does not address this kind of situation. The law does not authorize or allow the Minister of Finance to make an exemption. The law does not provide powers for the minister to give exemption. That is my clarification, Sir. I thank you very much.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, for your information while you are debating this motion I am reliably informed that in this event where Dorcus Inzikuru got a gold medal there were other Ugandans. I understand they are here. I should mention them: we had Boniface Kiprop, Alex Malinga, Moses Kipsiro, Wilson Busienei and Paskar Owor. You are welcome. (Applause)   

I think it is fair to give hon. Omara Atubo a chance because he said there should be a formal motion and it has come. Contribute briefly, please.

3.21
MR OMARA ATUBO (Otuke County, Lira): Mr Speaker, I am also extremely happy and proud of our daughter, Dorcus Inzikuru. I come from Otuke, which has a lot of potential for sports. This is a place, which is near Karamoja and moving towards Turkana and, therefore, the people who are gifted in that type of highland are very good runners. 

I am also happy that none other than Mr Acon from Otuke in my village did carry the flag of this country for the Commonwealth games. While we are bestowing great honour on this lady or this daughter of ours, I do not want us to behave as people who go for functions, they eat all the meat in the family and leave the family starving. I think we should do something concrete as a House and as a Government to ensure that the name of Inzikuru is written in rock and shall never perish. (Applause).  

In 1972 I witnessed my brother Akii Bua coming back and honoured by Idi Amin. At that time what Idi Amin did was to name a great street in Kololo, Akii Bua –(Interruption) 

PROF. KAGONYERA: Nakasero.

MR ATUBO: Yes, you live there; you know better –(Laughter)- people like us live in Kisenyi –(Interruption)

PROF. KAGONYERA: Mr Speaker, is it in order for hon. Omara Atubo to allege that because we have given him the right information we live in Nakasero? As a matter of fact we do not. Is it in order for hon. Omara Atubo to make that allegation when in fact I came to this House and moved a motion for this House to honour the late Akii Bua and only three of us actually honoured our pledge? I have smuggled this one in because he is saying Inzikuru’s name should be written in rock. I am reminding the House that actually you reneged on a pledge. 

THE SPEAKER: Maybe he has seen you in the evening so many times in Nakasero and he thought you live there. (Laughter)

MR ATUBO: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker and my good friend the minister for this great humour. It is a great day we accept it. As I was remunerating what Idi Amin did, let me say it is an analogy, which is bringing me to what I would be proposing for my sister. 

The Government of Idi Amin did receive Akii Bua with great honour and a street was named after him. A car, I think it was a unique Peugeot 604 at that time, was given to him and a house was given to him. We in Lango named a football ground you call it a stadium, but I do not know why they call it a stadium. We call it Akii Bua Stadium. We also named many other streets and villages in Lango after Akii Bua and many children who were born after him. So, I –(Interruption)

MR AWORI: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to inform my colleague and the honourable House that the matter of Akii Bua was a little bit embarrassing. The house you are talking about has since been repossessed by the previous owner and in the process when the court bailiff raided the house to evict the family the gold medal was stolen. (Laughter)

MR ATUBO: Yes, Mr Speaker, I do hope that what will be done for Dorcus Inzikuru will be concretised and legalized so that what is supposed to have happened, misfortunes, which befell Akii Bua and family do not happen to Dorcus Inzikuru. It is an experience and a lesson to us. 

Therefore, the name Inzikuru should not simply be a great thing we are talking about in this House now and after that we leave and possibly in 10 to 20 years nobody will remember. Even if we give her a car, a house and so on, those are things, which may be personal to her but we want something, which will go down in the history of this country. 

I support the proposals that in recognition of her great achievement and honour she brought to Uganda, the Government will fully fund her education. I support that she should be provided with easy transport, a car and a house. However, I also propose that a street with an unnecessary colonial name in Kampala be given to her in her name. But above all I think this to me is still not enough. This is a lady who has brought two gold medals for us. There will be no great honour to bestow on her as a woman, as a great athletic, as a person who brought two gold medals and as motivation for the young people of this country. 

If we rename Nakivubo Stadium to be called Inzikuru Stadium –(Interjection)- the name Nakivubo is just a river, it is a channel. Nakivubo Stadium as of now is named after a channel and worse of all a dirty channel. But I want Nakivubo Stadium to be renamed Inzikuru Stadium. I do move.

MRS MARGARET BABA DIRI (Representative of Persons with Disabilities, Northern): Thank you, Mr Speaker for giving me the opportunity to talk on this special occasion when we are paying glorious tribute to our daughter Dorcus Inzikuru who has won for us a gold medal. 

I would like to congratulate Inzikuru for making Uganda proud, for making Arua proud, for making the people of Uganda proud. Inzikuru, congratulations thank you for that great achievement you have bestowed on us Ugandans. 

During the hit for the finals she was interviewed. Dorcus Inzikuru, I heard you said, “I will run until I die for Uganda on the track.” (Applause) Indeed, Dorcus Inzikuru, you have made it. Thank you very much for working very hard for Uganda. Awadifo Amboru Amboru! (Laughter) 

Inzikuru comes from a very humble family in Vura sub-country, Arua District. The parents are there, Mr Lulua and Joyce Lulua. Let me explain to you the meaning of Inzikuru. Inzi means respect and kuru means not there. It means in their family one person or all of them might not have been respected in the past and today Inzikuru has come to clear that lack of respect -(Applause)- Inzikuru has brought her family here. Today we are respecting her family and Inzikuru for the great work she has done.  

Inzikuru I am well aware that all the talents God has given you are put in your legs. That means the best you can do is to run and that is the thing, which will earn you a living all your life. Inzikuru, this running definitely has been achieved, but I would like you to pursue your education in the line of sports -(Applause)- you can finish your senior six and study sports in higher education.  

I am amazed that we do not have physical education or science as a subject. It is important that you take that subject so that you also train young men and women to be like you in future. Inzikuru now you are very active and definitely the time may come when you may not run. We want you to plan for your life.  

Ugandans, this little girl of ours, the golden girl, has made us proud. What are we doing for her? What can we give her? She still has the vigour to bring more gold. In future she is going to bring more gold to Uganda. What can we do for her to work harder and earn more gold? The Government of Uganda, there should not be any excuse of saying there is no money –(Laughter)– with all this excitement surely you cannot promise Inzikuru –(Laughter)– how will she feel? Where is she going to hang the golden medal? I imagine this gold medal is not going to that grass-thatched house in Vura; it will get burnt!  

Therefore, I am sure the Ministry of Education will have to keep this gold medal or even put it in the State House so that it is safe until she brings another one. Therefore, if you are keeping the gold medal you must do something for the person who has brought the gold medal. If Aki Bua was given a house, why not Dorcus Inzikuru? Yes, if you have given the men what about our girl Inzikuru – (Applause)- so she deserves a car. Definitely will you not be ashamed if our little Aura gazelle, the golden girl walks on the street and she is knocked down? She needs a car.  

Inzikuru also needs to be remembered in Arua. I know people of Arua are all waiting for her to come and they will also pay their glorious tribute. But in Kampala here, Inzikuru today it is your day; it is a special day. It is very rare that people are honoured in that way.  So, please, thank God and we thank your parents for bringing you up.

I ask the Ministry of Sports to develop more young men and women to take up this career of sports. Uganda has potential sports men and women when they are developed. So, the Ministry of Education and Sports should support sports so that more of Inzikurus can come up. Thank you Inzikuru. You have made us proud. We are very proud of you. Awadifo Amboru mi aci muke. (Laughter)

3.38
MRS GERTRUDE CHELANGAT (Woman Representative, Kapchorwa):  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate our daughter for the wonderful thing she has brought to this country Uganda. We are very proud of you as mothers, as parents and as a country.

I stood up because you mentioned three athletes who have accompanied Inzikuru. Those three athletes you mentioned hail from Kapchorwa district –(Applause)- so, I want to inform this country and the House that actually as you look for resources Kapchorwa is a potential area for sports. I am told - I do not know whether it is true - that one of the athletes, Boniface Kiprop, would have also come with a medal if he had had a trainer or somebody to support him effectively. So, we have missed, not that he cannot make it but because of his training, which is not full.  

So I will echo what hon. Baba Diri has said that the results of Madam Inzikuru should be an eye opener to government. We have not passed the Budget of this year. So there is room to amend the Budget and we increase the funds in the Ministry of Sports so that the talents we have now can be exploited and the image of this country can be improved. I request that in the coming Budget we have to put funds aside and identify potential athletes so that this country can move forward like Ethiopia, Kenya and the US. We need more gold medals, more silver, and more bronze. That is my request. My district has all the potential to bring you more gold medals. Thank you very much.

3.40
MR SULAIMAN MADADA (Bbaale County, Kayunga): Mr Speaker, as Ugandans celebrate the pride brought by the success of Inzikuru, there are lessons to learn. One of the lessons to learn right away for Parliament and the country at large is that promotion of sports is a unifying factor in this country. (Applause) You look at Inzikuru, nobody is bothered about where she originates from, whether she is a DP, UPC or NRM; all the people are now celebrating her success. The point I want to bring forward is that where we have something done for the good of this country we should respect that good without looking at our political, religious, and social or culture groupings. Therefore, what we are seeing today is a good lesson for Uganda. Let us promote our country positively in order to create a good image so that everybody can be proud of this country.  

I would like also to look at the point that was mentioned by the Minister of Sports, that is No. 4, that Parliament urges the private sector to continue supporting sports. Promotion of sports cannot be monopolized by the state. Therefore, it is very important that we even recognise the business community like Katumwa Sports Centre and UTODA that are putting a lot of effort in sports. But another partner that has promoted sports is the media fraternity especially the sports pressmen like Patrick Luwandaga, Stuart Mutebi, Francis Kyeyune, Zikusooka and Masembe who are doing their best through almost every radio station. Therefore, as we look around, we should look at all these sectors and have a comprehensive policy not only to look at the actors in the field but also other people who are stakeholders in promoting sports. 

As we celebrate this success, you should remember that we brought a motion about two years ago of our celebrated referee Ali Tomusange. I think that almost ended the story. However, it reminds us that as we talk here today we should put something practical and visible that should be pursued even hereafter. 
 
MR KIDEGA: Thank you very much honourable member for giving me the chance. (Laughter) At one time in Botswana a daughter of Africa won the Miss World contest and after winning that position she was appointed the goodwill ambassador. So, I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to consider appointing Inzikuru as a goodwill ambassador and while looking at the status of our passports, if she holds an ordinary passport, it can be raised to a blue or a red one. Thank you very much. (Laughter)

MR MADADA: Thank you for the information. I had almost come to the end of my contribution and I think that is good. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: I understand the minister has two points to clarify then the Prime Minister will make an official statement.

3.45
THE MINISTER OF STATE, SPORTS (Mr Charles Bakkabulindi): Thank you very much. Mr Speaker, before I respond to some very serious issues that have been raised, allow me to thank my colleagues for strongly supporting this motion. Allow me to briefly recognise the important role that has been played by the Uganda Athletics Federation Executive who was seated there, the President and the General Secretary who had to move and escort Inzikuru to where she has been. I also appreciate the role played by the Uganda Olympic Committee, as we talk now their president Maj. Gen Nyangweso is on the other side.

Allow me to recognise the role played by the coach. Much as UNATO is not around, the guardian/coach Fravilo is around. (Applause) 

Allow me once again to thank all the supporters and promoters who have done and contributed to the successful event of Inzikuru today. 

While hon. Bada Diri was contributing she talked about developing more of the young men and women.  And indeed on this note, I want to indicate that to show that the Government has come in strongly to support sports, just over the weekend I sent a team of young athletes from the universities to Turkey. That journey alone was worth US $64,000, which is about Shs 116 million despite the meager resources we have. Despite the meager resources we have, Inzikuru was proceeding to Zurich for other events but we had to come in and cater for all her travel expenses for her to come and be with us today, and she is leaving the country tomorrow. (Applause)

A lot of issues have been raised and I indeed support my colleagues, they are all supportive. All the contributions have been on how we can support the Ministry of Education and Sports. Earlier on in the copy I gave you I thought that after moving the motion I was going to add on more “meat” but in that copy the ministry or the Government has already taken a decision of giving or providing a decent house to Inzikuru. (Applause) That one is already in the pipeline. What is remaining, even this morning, I had to get a separate meeting with Inzikuru to ask her what sort of house she wants and she has already notified us. (Applause)

On the issue of Inzikuru’s education, my ministry has no problem, it is administrative and we are handling it. The leader of Government Business will answer the issue of the car and diplomatic passports to athletes.

Once again, I want to thank all the honourable members for the great support you have shown. Since morning even the wanainchi themselves have shown support right from Entebbe up to here, which is enough to show that the entire country was happy about Inzikuru’s success. I thank you very much. (Applause)

3.48
THE PRIME MINISTER (Prof. Apolo Nsibambi): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Hon. Members of Parliament, as you know I am an enthusiastic goalkeeper. (Laughter) I learnt these skills at Kings College Buddo, but I never attained even a village status but Inzikuru has attained a global status. So we are very proud of her for winning this gold medal, she has enhanced Uganda’s positive image globally. (Applause)  It is very difficult to advertise a country; it is very costly but she was able to advertise us within nine minutes and 24 seconds. (Applause) She has done us proud. 

As you know, sports is essential in order to keep the body healthy but you must encourage the culture of sports from homes. You must begin with parents encouraging the children to participate in sports. The second stage is kindergarten, primary and secondary school upwards. If these measures are taken we should be able to institutionalise the culture of sports. I am given to understand that military skills are acquired from sports. 

Honourable members, I want to thank you because you have made very many good proposals. So, I have no hesitation in requesting the Minister of Education and Sports to work closely with the Minister of Finance and bring a paper to Cabinet -(Applause)- so that we can work out a comprehensive system of rewarding not only this lady but other future successful people who will perform well and when this is done we shall be able to announce it nationally and globally. I support the motion.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much. Honourable members, the motion is for a resolution of Parliament seeking to pay glorious tribute and appropriate recognition to Dorcus Inzikuru. These other details will come in when the paper is written. There are certain financial implications, which you cannot bring in this motion, otherwise you will be challenged but you have given ideas, which will be taken up and be considered. Instead of creating hurdles to the motion, I put the question to the motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE SPEAKER: Before we proceed with another item on the Order Paper, hon. Tiperu has a small statement to make. Can you make it now? 

PERSONAL STATEMENT

3.55

MS NUSURA TIPERU (Woman Representative, Yumbe): Well, Mr Speaker, my statement is not in line with Inzikuru because honourable colleagues might be thinking that it is in line with that. I hope we have concluded her matter. My statement is in line with publication that appeared in The Monitor on the 15th of this month, talking about hon. Moses Ali warning against rebellion in the West Nile region. 

On behalf of the people I represent, I would like the Government and this Parliament to know that the people are concerned. They have told me to assure government that West Nile is extremely peaceful; it is three years ago when Maj. Gen. Bamuze signed a peace agreement with government and they are saying that government has fulfilled its part. The balance of what has not been fulfilled is about to be fulfilled and that they have no intention of taking Uganda backwards since they are committed to the peace agreement. I, therefore, request The Monitor not to use headlines that indicate that there is a seeming recruitment of people into rebellion in the region when actually we are now living harmoniously and enjoying peace. Thank you.

BILLS
COMMITTEE STAGE

THE CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT NO.2) BILL, 2005

Clause 6

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that clause 6 stand part of the Bill.

MR MWESIGE: I would like to propose the following amendments to clause 6. It is the proposed First Schedule, and I propose we delete the current clause 6 and replace it with the following:

“First Schedule: First of all Kampala, and then the districts of Uganda, are the following: Bundibugyo, Busia, Kasese, Mbale, Sironko, Butaleja, those are the districts, which are not appended to any regional grouping. 

In Karamoja region we have Abim, Abong, Kotido, Moroto and Nakapiripirit. 

In Sebei region we have Kapchworwa and Bukwa, Adjumani and Moyo of Madi.” That is the amendment.

To Koboko, Arua, Nebbi, Yumbe and Kubala, I have added Kubala of West Nile, as a district of West Nile. This is the district, which was created out of Maracha and Terego. It has finally acquired a name called Kubala. I have a communication from the minister to that effect.

The next region is Acholi and in Acholi we have Amulu, which is also a new district, which has also acquired a name –(Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN: Excuse me, did we give the name when we made a resolution, what will be the procedure? I am just trying to find out because when we make a resolution we have to name a district and I suppose we have also to name the headquarters so that we declare it a town council. What is the procedure of doing this?

PROF. KABWEGYERE: Thank you, Mr Chairman. In the resolution it was agreed that the districts, which had not yet decided on the name of the headquarters, should decide on the name they would be given. So, it has now been agreed by some of these districts that the headquarters should be clear. Kubala is one of them and whenever the others decide appropriate changes will be made. 

THE CHAIRMAN: I am only concerned with the procedure. Did the people sit and name a district without reverting to us, or it is the ministry to decide? I am just trying to get information.

PROF. KABWEGYERE: Mr Chairman, the way I understand the implementation of this recommendation by the ministry is that Parliament gives a go ahead. For example in the proposed Manafwa District consisting of Bubulo and Manjiya the headquarters are to be agreed on. I thought once the headquarters are agreed on it was not necessary to come back to Parliament and say the headquarters have been agreed on. It would be purely administrative and that would be it. In this case before we make the final amendments a name has been agreed on and has come to us so it is tabled like the way it is and that is it.

MR AWORI: Mr Chairman, I would like to pursue a little bit further your concerns in terms of procedure. Notwithstanding the explanation of the honourable minister, I do not see how you can amend a resolution of Parliament administratively. If you are going to amend it, definitely you will have to come back to the august House and seek the permission of the House to amend the original resolution so that it is consistent and to avoid any doubt in the minds of the people. Otherwise, these new names springing up from left or right –(Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN: It is a very simple matter. If there was a problem of knowing the name and so forth, but this has been resolved. What is to be done is for the minister to come back with the agreed names of the districts and report to us for our records because we are the ones sealing the creation of districts. After that we shall quickly endorse and the record is corrected rather than doing this in the backyard and say it was done. We could later say, “Bring the record, where did we do this?” It may cause a problem. I do not know but that is my feeling.

MS ERIYO: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I wonder whether it would not be a consequential amendment if the minister were prepared to bring the districts for example before the constitutional amendment process is concluded so that we include it there? Procedurally I think it would be right for him to first bring it to Parliament so that we can approve it. 

THE CHAIRMAN: We can even do it now so that we straighten the record.

MR MWESIGE: I seek your guidance, Sir. By mentioning them to be appended in the schedule, if the House agrees, we would be actually be adopting their name. 

PROF. KABWEGYERE: Mr Chairman, in the case of Maracha – I am now reading from the resolution we passed: “A new district consisting of Maracha and Terego counties to be created out of Arua District with its headquarters yet to be agreed upon after which it will be named.”  

When proposals for the creation of new districts are made they are submitted to the ministry and a process takes place up to Parliament. In this case if there is evidence that there has been an agreement as to the name of the headquarters, therefore, I thought this now could become administrative but I could have an information presentation here that the names as agreed upon – (Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN: What you do, even tomorrow you can come and say on such a day we passed a resolution to create these districts in some cases we just mapped out the geographical boundary, we did not give the name, this matter has been resolved for that area because it is the headquarters, and the name is this. Then there will be no problem but when we made the resolution apparently you gave the impression – whoever brought it - that there was no evidence that they had agreed. Now you have to report back to say that there is evidence they have agreed and this is the position, we endorse it then it becomes the name in our records. This is what I think we should do.

MR WAKIKONA: Mr Chairman, I would like to agree with you totally because in the case of Manafwa as it was created, it has created a lot of conflicts because of arbitrary naming of the district without both parties, Manjiya and Bubulo sitting down to agree on the name. So, I agree with you that this matter should be brought up, discussed and the districts be named in this House. Thank you.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, I think a day or two ago some people came to me complaining that we had named a district, for instance Nakaseke, and we had given Nakaseke as the headquarters but after that people sat and changed the headquarters, which we had named in the resolution, to another place. I did not understand whether the council itself without reverting to us can change a resolution of Parliament. This is what is bothering me. I hope honourable minister is aware of this.

PROF. KABWEGYERE: Mr Chairman, I take your guidance particularly in light of what hon. Wakikona has just said. There are wrangles around where the headquarters should be, in many of the cases where we left the declaration of the headquarters incomplete. I, therefore, promise when this is all sorted out I will come to the House for the final approval.  

THE CHAIRMAN: Well, let me explain so that this thing is cleared. You need not be in the schedule but the Constitution has provisions to enable other districts to come up and be recognised so long as they are created in accordance with the law. So what we do with the schedule is only for those districts of which we are certain have no problems and then we go ahead. When the other problems are settled and procedurally carried, they become districts because the Constitution empowers them to become districts.

MRS AKECH: Thank you. Mr Chairman, out of Gulu we curved out a district from the counties of Kilak and Nwoya and the district council of Gulu did sit to give us a name, which name was actually forwarded to the Minister of Local Government. Therefore, I want to state here that for us in Gulu we really do not have any problem and we would be happy to see that the name Amuru is included in the schedule. 

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, why don’t we provisionally deal with this clause hopping that the minister will come with the paper tomorrow?

PROF. KABWEGYERE: Mr Chairman, there is a lot more work to be done than can be completed tonight and I was not about to come here piecemeal. I want to table something that is complete. I, therefore, plead for more time but I think the names could be added since the districts have been approved.

THE CHAIRMAN: I think it is okay.

MR MWESIGE: I, therefore, proceed to name those whose names were mentioned by the resolution of Parliament. I had mentioned Kapchorwa and Bukwo, I am sorry the spelling was not correct in my amendment, Bukwo, there is “o” at the end.

THE CHAIRMAN: Is it not Bukwa?

MR MWESIGE: Those who know the language have advised me that it is “o”. So it is Bukwo.

Kapchorwa and Bukwo of Sebei; Adjumani and Moyo of Madi; Koboko, Arua, Nebbi and Yumbe of west Nile; Gulu, Kitgum and Pader of Acholi, Amuru was not mentioned in the resolution. So I will differ its listing in the schedule. 

In Buliisa, there is double “ii” after “l”.  Hoima, Kibaale and Masindi of Bunyoro; Kabalore, Kamwenge and Kyenjojo of Toro; Amuria, Katakwi, Kumi, Soroti and Kaberamaido of Teso; Kalangala, Kayunga, Kiboga, Luwero, Masaka, Mityana, Mpigi, Mubende, Mukono, Nakaseke, Nakasongola, Rakai, Sembabule and Wakiso of Buganda, Bushenyi, Ibanda, Isingiro, Kiruhura, Mbarara and Ntungamo of Ankole.  Amurata, Apac, Dokolo, Lira and Oyam of Lango; Busiki, Bugiri, Iganga, Jinja, Kaliro, Kamuli and Mayuge of Busoga; and Kabale, Kanungu, Kisoro and Rukungiri of Kigezi. Mr Chairman Sir, I beg to move.

MR LUKYAMUZI: Mr Chairman, my amendment on clause 6 impacts on clause 4 and we have stood over clause 4. I hope I will be given time to move it appropriately.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay.

MRS KASULE: Mr Chairman, I want to request the minister to explain to me what the implications of this grouping are.

MS ERIYO: Mr Chairman, I thought there are districts that requested to be deemed to be of a region, and I am wondering whether this is in anticipation that those districts that are grouped will become a region? Isn’t this a contradiction to the object of the Bill that requests or asks districts or leaves it to the districts to agree to form a region? 

THE CHAIRMAN: No the system of grouping the minister has done started in 1995 when we were in the Constituent Assembly. That is when this started coming in, recognition of Buganda and so forth, and it was anticipated that if a district, which is said to be of Buganda is broken into two, even the new part will become a district of Buganda. And so we had districts of Toro, Busoga and I think what the minister is doing is exactly that. It is not for purposes of regions but for purposes of the schedule of districts.

MS ERIYO: But in the Constitution some of the districts were not grouped and now the grouping has come without consultations. It is like an assumption. I want the minister to explain why.

THE CHAIRMAN: Can you point out which ones those are?

MS ERIYO: Sir, the districts that have been grouped are those of Acholi, Lango, Busoga, Bunyoro, Buganda and Ankole; the rest were not grouped. Can the minister explain why West Nile was not even grouped? We want to understand the implications of all this and why these groupings came up for those districts that were not grouped before.

MR MWESIGE: As the chairman did explain, the genesis of this grouping was in the CA.  It is nothing new that we are introducing. There are no districts that we have grouped without consulting the leaders who run them. The grouping of the districts of Madi was actually proposed by hon. Eriyo today. She talked to me: Madi and Adjumani were proposed by hon. Eriyo. The grouping of Toro was there in the Constitution; the grouping of Bunyoro was in the Constitution; the grouping of Buganda has been in the Constitution; the grouping of Acholi is in the Constitution; the grouping of Ankole is in the Constitution. We have only added new districts that emerged out of other parent districts, which were already in those regions.  

The grouping of Karamoja was proposed by hon. Lokeris in concurrence with Members of Parliament from Karamoja. So, those districts that have not been grouped have not opted to be grouped in any regional grouping. If they wish to be grouped, those proposals can be presented now for the consideration of the House. I would like to make it clear as you have done that this grouping does not imply the deeming of districts at all.  

MS AKELLO: Mr Chairman, I want to make it clear for the sake of my sister hon. Eriyo who has asked about the case of Teso. The districts of Teso had even passed a charter of co-operation and for the information of this August House, we have even proposed that Soroti will be our regional headquarters. We who were in the Constituent Assembly were taken to task when the name Teso did not appear in the Constitution and we were told that since we had the opportunity to review the Constitution, the name Teso must appear with the constituent districts.

MRS KASULE: Mr Chairman, I have one small question. After these groupings, can one district form a regional government with another district outside that grouping?  

THE CHAIRMAN: So long as you follow the provisions, you can. You can form Bugiri with Kisoro.

MRS HYUHA: Mr Chairman, my immediate concern - I do not know whether the minister has looked at any provision for those, which may not be ready now and after consultation may have an opportunity to deem themselves. When I look at the districts of former Bukedea like Pallisa, Budaka, Butaleja, Tororo, Busia, we may need to make some consultation and we group ourselves as districts of Bukedea yet we are not mentioned here. 

I also foresee probably with further consultation that we may go back to the greater Bukedea. Districts of Pallisa, Mbale, Sironko, Tororo, Busia had our former headquarters originally at Mbale. Looking at this list, I do not see any provision, which we have put in place for the districts that have not made further consultations so that we are not left behind. I want to know from the minister whether we have that provision so that when I go back to Butalejja District, they are properly informed about that.

THE CHAIRMAN: We are in a process of amending the Constitution. This is an opportunity for you, if you think you missed in the Constituent Assembly and you want it here, we have the mandate to address your problem and solve it. It is up to you really.

MR BESISIRA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I am not speaking in the capacity of chairman but as Member of Parliament for Buyaga. I would like to correct the name Kibale. It is double “a” not single “a”. Kibaale of Bunyoro, not Kibale.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, thank you very much.

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, I just want to put on record that when we received some of these amendments in the committee and we had proposed them as such, the same issue raised by hon. Jessica Eriyo had been previously raised before the committee by hon. Agard Didi and in the case of Bugisu, there were representations that the two districts of Mbale and Sironko, which were then existing, be grouped as districts of Bugisu. We had to recommend this amendment to Parliament.

THE CHAIRMAN: In that case if the Mbale people have agreed on Bugisu, it means even the new districts, which we have created, because they are coming from those, are of Bugisu. I think that can be arranged. 

MR ASUPASA: Mr Chairman, the district of Busiki - the resolutions that were passed by the councils indicated that we wish it to be called the district of Namutumba with the headquarters at Namutumba. There has not been any contrary report to that effect. There is nobody standing up to say that it should not be called Namutumba. I, therefore, request the honourable minister to set the record straight that instead of Busiki, this district should be called Namutumba with the headquarters at Namutumba.

PROF. KABWEGYERE: Mr Chairman, we run into a danger of one person naming a district. Consultations must really take place to avoid head-on collisions that we are already witnessing. I would like to request the honourable member to let us get evidence of this change and we shall take the necessary corrective measures. But if there is nothing in writing to us, I have nothing to present to this House other than the member presenting his voice.

THE CHAIRMAN: What we can do, if a district was named and given a name, we should keep it here. Should need arise to change the name, we shall go through the right channels, procedures and change and as I have said. The Constitution allows creation of new districts in future. In future we may create other ten or so and the Constitution empowers us to do so.  

MR OMWONY OJWOK: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman.  Just two small issues: one is that in the official paper, which is guiding our discussions here, there is reference to Abin. I wanted to put it or record that the name is Abim.

Two, in another forum yesterday I mentioned that consultations were still going on regarding the inclusion of Abim as part of the Karamoja grouping. I would like now to state that I have the pleasure of announcing that these consultations have continued to the end and Abim has now agreed to be part of Karamoja grouping. Thank you.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, we need to sort out these. Maybe we should stand this particular one over so that you can sit in an hour or so and clear this apparent mess, which is coming on, so that we have only two stood over clauses for purposes of clearing the names and the groupings and then tomorrow we deal with them.

MR WESONGA: Mr Chairman, the clarification I am seeking is, the Chairman of the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee mentioned two districts of Bugisu that is Sironko and Mbale. I do know where he left the newly curved out districts of Manafwa and Bubulo in Mbale.

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, I was basing on the report as of 21 April 2005, but I have also advised that there are other new names that will have to be dealt with later. That is why for example we are still even insisting on Amoro to be straight away added there because there is no controversy on it. But like the Speaker said, the new district that would be carved out of these two districts will now fall within this grouping – I think the chairperson has clarified on that.

MR MWESIGE: Mr Chairman, I have clause 8, which is the last clause. I requested we stand over clause 4, and now we have stood over clauses 6 and 7.

Clause 8

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, I put the question that clause 8 stand part of the Bill.
