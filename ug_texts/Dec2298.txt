	1hon. Brig. Jim  Muhwezi for a vacancy on the Rules, Privileges and Discipline Committee.

THE SPEAKER:  The hon. Jimmy Muhwezi has been nominated on the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline.  Any other?

MR. ADOME LOKWII: Point of clarification.  I wanted to find out because there could have been some Members who submitted their names to be nominated and may not necessarily be on the ballot paper, and it would have sorted a few problems of nominating or re-nominating people who are already nominated. For example, Mr. Speaker, I submitted my name for Commissions and Statutory Bodies, but I do not know whether it is there and I do not like somebody to come up to renominate me if I am not there.  

Secondly, hon. Abura had approached me to nominate him on the Committee on the National Economy, but I do not know whether his name is there or not. So, that is the clarification I was seeking, Mr. Speaker.

THE SPEAKER:  That is a good question. I was coming to the next point to read the nominees of each Committee and I think that will solve the problem. Is that okay?  Now, we start with the first Committee.

MR. MAO:  Mr. Speaker, I rise to withdraw my name, because I am already on another Standing Committee; and in view of the interesting business coming to that Committee on Rules, I do not wish to resign. Since I cannot be on two Standing Committees, I will stand down in favour of the hon. Member for Kyamuswa.

THE SPEAKER:  Is there any objection, I suppose no.

THE SPEAKER: Now, we have only one person who has been nominated in the case of the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline, that is hon. Jim Muhwezi. And I think we will proceed this way, that when you are voting, because his name does not appear here, you write it immediately below. If you are voting for him, then you tick, you create a space just like it is indicated on the ballot paper and make the tick. Is that correct?  And you also at the same time delete hon. Mao from the Public Accounts Committee.

MRS. BABA DIRI:  Point of clarification. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  I beg to be clarified. I remember very well when they put up a notice on the notice board saying that those who are interested to contest for these positions should put their names below, I put mine under Rules and Privileges; now you are telling us these people have been nominated, may I know when they were nominated and why my name is not there?  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.


THE SPEAKER:  Well, I am really in a difficulty here, because the appropriate procedure for nominations was followed, and I think the appropriate papers were put on the board for purposes of people indicating whether they wish to serve on certain Committees. That was done.

MR. MWANDHA:  Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Since we still have the opportunity to make further nominations, may I nominate hon. Margaret Baba Diri for the Committee on Rules and Privileges?

THE SPEAKER: Is that seconded?  So, just like in the case of the hon. Jim Muhwezi, when you are voting, when it comes to the Committee on Rules and Privileges, you write down the hon. Margaret Baba Diri's name and also indicate your vote by the tick at an appropriate space.

MR. MUSUMBA: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. With regard to the National Economy Committee, the positions available are actually two and not one. Mr. Elijah Mushemeza was a Member of the Committee before the ruling that has turned the results in Bushenyi, in Sheema. Then hon. Aggrey Awori who was a Member of that Committee resigned from the Committee to join the Appointments Committee, so the positions available are two, not one.

MR. WAMBEDE:  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am a Member of that Committee and hon. Musumba is our Chairman, and I do confirm the two positions that exist. In view of that, Mr. Speaker, and with your permission, may I propose hon. Guma to be nominated on that Committee?  Mr. Speaker, hon. Guma can either withdraw from my nomination or from Commissioner, or otherwise, if may be given other -

THE SPEAKER: The correct position is that, there are actually two vacancies on the Committee on the National Economy, and therefore,  I call for nominations.

MISS. NANKABIRWA: Mr. Speaker, I beg that nominations be closed.

THE SPEAKER: Seconded? I now put the question that nominations be closed.

(Question put and agreed to)

THE SPEAKER:  It is going to be voting by secret ballot, you will be issued with ballot papers. So, we will call out your name and you come and collect the ballot paper.

(The Voting exercise started) 

MR. MUTYABA:  Point of procedure.  Mr. Speaker, I do not want to stop the process, however, I believe that we should do it in accordance with the Rules. Now, when you read Rule 122 which concerns the elections to the Standing Committee, Rule 122(3) says that: " The nominations under Subrule (2) of this Rule shall be in writing, seconded by at least 20 Members whose signatures shall appear on the nomination form together with the signatures of the nominated persons, indicating acceptance of the nominations."  Now, in order to go behind this Rule, we have to move under Rule 8. I wanted this to be on record, Mr. Speaker, Rule 8 to suspend Rule 122 in order to allow the nominations which have been made today to be valid.  But I am asking for your guidance, Mr. Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Order please.  I believe the hon. Member's intervention is in reference to the people who are nominated from the Floor. Is that my understanding?  Because the process of nominating the others who appear on the ballot paper has been followed and I think your intervention is in reference to those who have been nominated on the Floor. And his proposal is that in order to go round that we should invoke Rule 8.

MAJ. GEN. TUMWINE:  Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether we should continue voting when we are discussing how to proceed. Because I have a problem with how we change our Rules and for what reasons. I am of the view that this Rule was prepared and put in our Rules of Procedure after the Committee that was working on it had thought about it thoroughly and had reasons why they had put it in our Rules of
