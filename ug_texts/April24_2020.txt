COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you to this morning’s sitting. As agreed, we shall continue with the supply of development expenditure. I see some matters of national importance on the Order Paper but they will be done after we finish our work. I would like to propose that next week, on Tuesday, I give an hour for these matters because there are many Members who wanted to raise issues. However, if there is time, we will do that after the main work today.

Secondly, I would like to thank the banks for not complying with the funny order. It is only Orient Bank that is insisting. Therefore, I am advising the management of Orient Bank to desist from that illegality and allow Members to operate their accounts. Thank you.

MOTION THAT THE HOUSE RESOLVES ITSELF INTO A COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY FOR CONSIDERATION AND APPROVAL OF:

    (I) THE REVISED EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018/2019

(II) BUDGETARY PROPOSALS FOR THE EXPENDITURE OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2020/2021

12.08

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, the question is that the report of the Committee of Supply be adopted. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

Report adopted.
	
THE SPEAKER:  Honourable minister, I understand your computation included statutory expenditure. You have included statutory expenditure in your report.

12.11
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Matia Kasaija): Madam Speaker, yesterday, we did the statutory expenditure - Chairman, what am I supposed to do? (Laughter)  

Madam Speaker, I beg to move a motion for appropriation of the budget for the financial year 2020/2021. I would like to amend the figure of Shs 45 trillion and substitute it with a figure of Shs 29,995,191,000,000 to be provided for as the grand total for recurrent and development expenditure for the various votes - central Government, referral hospitals, foreign missions and local governments - for the Financial Year 2020/2021. I beg to move.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, the figure will be adjusted accordingly.

12.13
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON BUDGET (Mr Amos Lugoloobi): Madam Speaker, I beg to move, under Rule 151, on the consideration of the Appropriation Bill, to request for between 30 minutes and one hour to retreat with members of the Budget Committee to scrutinise it to ensure the schedule thereto contains the allocations as appropriated by the Committee of Supply of the House.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, we shall grant the Committee on Budget between 30 minutes and one hour to ascertain the Appropriation Bill and return to us. In the meantime, we shall do the small businesses I talked about earlier.

I would like to thank the Committee on Budget, the Committee on Finance, the staff and all the Members of Parliament for enabling us complete the core work of the Third Meeting, which is the budget. Thank you, so much.

This tent was hired to enable us perform that core function of the budget and so, after Monday, we shall not have it, watch out for information on where we shall relocate to because we shall have to move to another venue to do the rest of the work next week.

12.15
MR JACOB OBOTH (Independent, West Budama County South, Tororo): Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter of national concern. First, I would like to thank you for this opportunity; probably it is the first time I am rising on it.

The issue of COVID-19 appears to be our concern, Government and everyone.  I know that this matter has been raised here before but we need some concrete statement or action from Government. The Government of Uganda, through the Ministry of Health, is handling COVID-19 so well. Last week, we had until yesterday, only about 55 cases with 40 plus recoveries.

As a person who comes from the border district of Tororo just like other Members from other border points, I would like to say that we are concerned about the competition between the economic rights and the right to life. Ugandans are complying with the Presidential directives and are safe but new infection cases are coming in from across the borders. 

The issue of the truck drivers has been raised here before and I seek your indulgence on this matter. The people in the border districts all know how they are vulnerable to these truck drivers. Their level of interpersonal relationship is not a matter that is debatable. They are people with great skills in interpersonal relations because wherever they stop, they have relatives.

We are in danger from the border of Malaba, Busia, Katuna, the other side bordering - for how long shall we wait? Can’t Government find a solution to have these truck drivers come in but be stationed in a place, test them and only allow them to drive out after knowing their results?

Alternatively, can’t Government install rapid testing equipment at the borders? We are endangering Ugandans. This matter has been coming up every time.  Today, new 11 cases came in through the border. Why are we committing suicide? Information is coming from all over and that should be an indication that this matter is - Madam Speaker, would you allow me take information?

THE SPEAKER: It has been raised by the same Members and so, let us find a solution.

MR OBOTH: We need a solution to this matter –(Interruption).

MS MUTONYI: Thank you, for giving way, my colleague. Madam Speaker, I have got numerous calls from my people in Manafwa and some from Namisindwa – you know we share a border with Kenya - requesting that the truck drivers should be tested while still in Mombasa. If our President can talk to his colleague on this request to have them tested before they come into Uganda - and they should present medical evidence to show they tested and maybe found negative.

I do not know what the other countries will say but let them test and we do it this side. In case there is doubt here, they can be retested but they should first be tested from their own countries especially at the start of the journey. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, this matter was raised by hon. Ongom, the Member for Moroto, hon. Lucy. We know it; let us find a solution. There is no point of repeating it because we have said it many times. Let us now hear from the Government.

12.21
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Matia Kasaija): Madam Speaker, this very matter before this Parliament, was discussed by the national committee coordinating the activities to find solutions to it. There are diplomatic and business concerns to look at. 

However, I would like to assure this House that by Monday, we shall be able to come out and tell the country how this matter will be sorted out. 

I cannot go into the details now because we have yet to consult many people, including our brothers and sisters across the border. Otherwise, we need to find a solution to the concerns of Parliament and the Executive, without necessarily killing ourselves by not allowing them in. There is a proposal, for example, that when truck drivers arrive at the border, they hand over their vehicles to other drivers. 

This means that if the company is stationed in Kenya, it must have an additional driver who stays here in Uganda and has been tested and we know he is not a threat to our health. The truck would then be handed over to that driver. If it is within Uganda, that is not a problem but if the truck is going to another country, then there will be another driver. That solution was proposed but we have to discuss this and see how to agree with our neighbouring countries. Thank you. 

THE SPEAKER: Let us have hon. Everlyn Chemutai. Honourable members, you have talked about this matter very many times, please. Let us have hon. Chemutai, hon. Ntende and then hon. Bitangaro.

12.24
MS EVERLYN CHEMUTAI (NRM, Woman Representative, Bukwo): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I stand to raise a matter of concern affecting the people of Bukwo, especially the people who are staying within the border areas.

The foot bridges were broken to discourage people from moving unnecessarily to the Kenyan side. However, we now have a very big problem; these people go to the Kenyan side to vend food. The Suam River is swollen but people still risk it saying that they would rather die looking for food than dying in the house. 

In the last three days, we have lost more than four people who drowned. We are burying two today and tomorrow, we are burying two more. 

There is also a very big problem within the security team. Yesterday, a woman was shot in Suam. After realising that a man had drowned, the women were raising an alarm and the security team went with guns and shot at the woman. Another pregnant woman slipped into a coma after hearing the gunshots. The whole of Suam Town Council is in chaos.

The security team is also complaining that they cannot do surveillance very well because there is too much rain. When they are told that there are people who are crossing from one side of the border - I am told they were only given motorcycles and they are requesting for a vehicle. 

Therefore, my prayers are:

    1. Can we get food for those people who are living within the border area? They do not have land and have to go to Kenya to look for food. That could help maybe.
    2. Let the security team stop beating up women and children.
    3. Let the Government give the security team a motor vehicle; a four-wheel drive, so that they can drive around the district as they support our people.

Thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable member, on the first issue of food, Shs 164 million has been sent to your district for the COVID-19 taskforce. If you sit with your district leadership, they will actually buy food for the people in that area. 

However, concerning the swelling of the river, I think that is a grave concern. It is not only River Suam but Lake Victoria as well as it is becoming a problem. We shall want the Government to advise us on what to do. You have seen the hotels in Entebbe and houses flooded. The fishing village is gone and we do not know when this will stop. Therefore, we shall ask the Government to give us advice on that issue.

On the question of transport, the President was distributing cars today. I hope that Bukwo will be one of the districts to get cars. If not, the national taskforce should be able to assist us. Does the Minister of Water and Environment want to say something?

12.26
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR WATER AND ENVIRONMENT (ENVIRONMENT) (Ms Beatrice Anywar): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would first of all, like to congratulate the House for the job well done under your leadership, Madam Speaker.

It is true that the country is experiencing extremely heavy rains, which were unanticipated. The water volume in our water bodies has been rising increasingly since the end of December and we expect it to continue increasing.

It is true that all those who have occupied water banks, protection zones, those who are downstream to main water bodies and wetlands are, indeed, at risk. As Government, we have said that if you are in a wetland, protection zone and along the water banks of our water bodies, including Lake Victoria and other main river bodies, please, do your best and leave.

If you do not leave voluntarily, Government, effective next week, shall go out to these points. First of all, we shall advise them increasingly to leave. Those who feel that they need an extra force to go, to save the lives of Ugandans - there are those who do not want to listen – we shall use reasonable force to ensure that those who are wrongfully in the wetlands and protection zones are evicted. 

I stand with those who are affected because of the release of water from our water bodies like those in the Lake Kyoga area. Those will be advised on what to do. Otherwise, for those who are illegally occupying those specified areas, as Government, we are now going into action effective next week.

12.30
MR ROBERT NTENDE (Independent, Bunya County South, Mayuge): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I rise on a matter of national importance that is affecting the districts that border Lake Victoria. One of them is my district.

As a Member who represents Bunya County South, I have seven islands. The waters of Lake Victoria have swallowed up one of the islands called Masolya and over 3,000 people are stranded. We need Government to evacuate them to the nearest islands. These neighbours have been living there for over five decades but as of now, the waters have become very hostile and our people are stranded.

My request to Government is, we need evacuation as soon as today because the RDC, CAO and other leaders have already set off to go to that island and see how best they can rescue the people. However, they do not have the capacity to evacuate these people.

Secondly, we need food relief and shelter for these people because the nearest islands are Dolwe, Sagitu and Kaza. We need food. When they resettle these people on other islands, they should be provided with food and relief. 

Madam Speaker, we need Government to act because we are going into the weekend yet, the people are stranded and we do not have any assistance –(Interruption) 

MS EGUNYU: Madam Speaker, I would like to thank, my colleague, for giving way. The information I would like to give is that the increasing water levels are not only in Mayuge but also in Buvuma, Kalangala and other water bodies. It is now very absurd because the islands are submerging beyond even the 200 metres recommended by NEMA. 

Therefore, Madam Speaker, as these waters increase, they go beyond the 200 metres. I would suggest that the Minister for Water and Environment should in a humble way find a solution for these islanders other than just advising that they should leave because this has been their land. Saying that they would use reasonable force to chase away these people is not right.

Government would think of a way to help and evacuate them, like my colleague has said, provide food and find a way of them getting basic needs because they cannot fight nature. However, Government should help these people because they are invaded by water. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable minister, this is a very serious issue. 

12.34
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Matia Kasaija): Madam Speaker, Government is there to protect everybody’s life. That is why you see that most of our activities these days are the plans on how we can save people’s lives against COVID-19.

Similarly, for our people on the islands, who are getting stranded, I would like to assure this House that - and I am sure somebody is already working on this - we shall evacuate them. We shall also, where necessary, provide them with food. That is the priority now as far as this Government is concerned. 

Just continue monitoring and giving us information. Sometimes, we have put an arrangement to go to people and survey the lakes but at times, we may miss one or two points. However, once we miss out, please, let us know and we shall get into action to ensure that we save the lives of Ugandans who are now in danger by drowning in water of the advancing lakes. 

Thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you.

12.36
MR SAM BITANGARO (NRM, Bufumbira County South, Kisoro): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise on a matter of national importance. Kisoro District is bordered by two countries, that is Rwanda to the south and DRC to the west. My constituency is host to the border post of Kyanika on the Rwanda side and Bunagana on the western side.

Madam Speaker, 60 per cent of the economic activities of Kisoro District are derived from cross-border trade, that is trading across borders, ferrying food and other items between Uganda and DRC and DRC and Rwanda.

However, right now, because of coronavirus, the borders are obviously closed. The one of Rwanda closed much earlier and this is because we do not have land. Kisoro District is overpopulated and according to the last population census, our population density was the highest in the country. It is 480 people per square meter. Therefore, you can imagine that there is no land for grazing, cultivation and even the little that is there is fragmented. Therefore, the people who used to do cross-border trade are now stuck and their economy is in shambles. 

Therefore, we are now asking, Madam Speaker, for affirmative action from the Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Relief and Disaster Preparedness. We are appealing and I know that the Budget was made for Shs 165 million for every district but here, because of the breakdown of the economic activities, I am requesting that you give affirmative action and give more food to these people who have lost their livelihood in terms of economic activities.

Secondly, we have about 3,500 people who do boda boda trade. These are all stuck, the more justification for affirmative action. Madam Speaker, last week, I visited the constituency and I was able to visit the Rwanda border and the DRC border at Bunagana. The teams are very alert and I would like to commend them that they are doing very good work and deserve support. 

Finally, Madam Speaker, there is a lot of concern about how the army is treating the people. These are not following the guidelines the President gave because they are caning everyone, even if you are going to the garden to harvest food. They do not even ask whether you are going to hospital or garden; they just cane. 

Therefore, there is an outcry and I would like to appeal to the authorities that meet the ministry concerned to intervene so that people are protected. The UPDF is a pro-people force and we love it. We do not want to go to the dark days of Uganda where you could see an army uniform and run. Therefore, I take this opportunity to appeal to the people concerned to take action. I thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, how do you support the economy, which has been shuttered even before COVID-19?

12.41
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Matia Kasaija): Before I speak about the economy of our people in Kisoro, let me draw the attention of this House to security officers who are beating our people. The President has been very emphatic on this. There is no need to beat our people.

As you may be reading in the press, those officers who have behaved like that will be handled in the same measure. There is no need of beating people. Instead, educate them but do not beat them.

The only problem is when the citizens become violent towards the security people. You remember what the President said? Disable them but do not kill and do not beat. I thought I should make this point very clear. 

I am appealing to you, colleagues, whenever you have an opportunity to see or to hear an officer of police or army beating our people, report immediately to the officers and that person will be punished.

On the economy of our people in Kisoro, next week, I will be coming to this Parliament to tell you what Government has decided in terms of rescuing the people who are doing business. There are measures, which we have decided as Cabinet. I am told by my officers that the speech is almost ready. I will come and tell you how we intend to help businesses that are struggling to survive. Please, give me a chance, I shall tell you precisely next week. I cannot give you the full details now. I would request that I come next Tuesday and then, we shall see what we can do. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: But honourable minister, on the issue of the soldiers beating the people, who is actually translating the President’s instructions to them? He did not say you must remain in your house or do not move. These people think moving is breaking guidelines. Who is actually translating the instructions from the President to the person on the street?

MR KASAIJA: It is a pity the Minister for Security is not here but now, since this is becoming a big issue, I promise to convey this matter both to the President and to the minister responsible for this then he can come and make a statement next week to this House.

THE SPEAKER: Okay. hon. Ssekikubo, then hon. Karungi.

MR THEODORE SSEKIKUBO (NRM, Lwemiyaga County, Sembabule): Thank you, Madam Speaker. With this situation of the lockdown, not only are we seeing our security officers - the UPDF and the Police harassing people, they have also taken advantage of this lockdown to break the law themselves. They have used this opportunity under the lockdown when the courts of law are in abeyance to do mischief.

I have a case in Lwemiyaga. On Saturday, 4 April 2020, a UPDF officer, Lt Col Biteya, drove a military vehicle registration number DAF039 and came into a matter onto the land with a pickup of soldiers. They forcefully ferried building materials: bricks, stones, sand and they forcefully constructed onto the land that had been determined and decided by court.

One resident called Makumbi and reported the matter to police but no action was taken. It was raised to the DPC Sembabule - Mr Denis Musinguzi, the RPC Mr Enoch Abaine and even with the Minister of State hon. Obiga kania. To our surprise, those implicated officers then eventually called saying that even Ssekikubo and others had even called and complained to the minister but we shall go ahead.

Madam Speaker, they do this under the cover of COVID-19; first of all, defying the orders of the Commander-in-Chief of the UPDF, taking advantage of the COVID-19 lockdown to grab land and upstage the status quo yet, the call for Government has always been to let the status quo remain until COVID-19 is over.

It could not have been the UPDF itself to be involved in the land grabbing and defying the directives of the President where everybody is supposed to be at home and not to gather more than two people but for them, they are doing it blatantly.

Therefore, Madam Speaker, why is Government and its institutions, particularly those, which are supposed to keep law and order in this country be appearing to operate above the law and above the directives of the President? Even when we appeal for help from our colleagues, the ministers, they look helpless. 

This matter is happening in Lwemiyaga, Sembabule District and they are continuing up to this point. That matter was raised to you, Madam Speaker. 

I would like to thank you for the opportunity that it has gone on record, that the UPDF is the one abusing the lockdown. Not like hon. Bitangaro has said of harassing people but they are going extrajudicial. They are the ones who are on rampage. We would have been patient with COVID-19 but those who are supposed to enforce the lockdown are the ones who are abusing it in that case, I have mentioned.

THE SPEAKER: Okay. Thank you. Honourable members, I received his complaint, which I have forwarded to the Minister for Defence but I am glad that the senior minister has also heard about the impunity that is going on in the country under the guise of the lockdown.

12.50
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Matia Kasaija): Madam Speaker, you know, managing human beings is a very complex issue. My suggestion hon. Ssekikubo, let us have what you have stated here, in writing. Please, do it this afternoon and I will be the happiest. I will forward it straight to the Commander-in-Chief and I can tell you action will be taken once it is verified. That is what I am suggesting. 

In addition, any one of you who experiences or is reported, please, put it in black and white because then, it becomes easier to follow. These details, which hon. Ssekikubo has said, I cannot keep them in my head. Please, put it in black and white, forward it to the Office of the Prime Minister and he will be able to forward it to the Office of the President. I know how he has been speaking about this question of security.

Those of us who have been with the army right from inception, that is not our way of doing things. Our base and strength is based on the people. Therefore, anybody who touches the people, that soldier or police officer, as far as I am concerned, should be removed from the forces there and then. However, we need information and evidence so that we do not act on hearsay. Thank you.

12.51
MS ELIZABETH KARUNGI (NRM, Woman Representative, Kanungu): Thank you, Madam Speaker, for the opportunity. I am also rising on a matter of national importance. Last year, in February, a conflict arose between the people of Uganda in Kanungu and those in DRC at the border in a matter concerning the boundary. The conflict was too much to the extent that we could not solve it at our level. 

Therefore, the RDC and other security heads in my district got involved but they also realised they could not manage to handle it. The Office of the Prime Minister gave us a hand and it was sorted. The 412 families in Ugandans had crossed to DRC Congo and settled there.

From February, when the conflict started, the Congolese refused the Ugandan people from digging in the land, which from the beginning they thought was theirs. Therefore, between May and June, when this issue was solved and the boundaries were reaffirmed, the Congolese refused the Ugandans who were there to pick anything, including the houses, which they had built. They refused them from removing the iron sheets so that they could use it somewhere. They refused them from accessing their coffee and tea and those who had coffee machines were also stopped from taking them.

Madam Speaker, the situation was very serious to the extent that Eng. Hillary Onek heard our plea. He came to Kanungu and we thought that we would get hope out of that. These 412 families were displaced since that time and the Office of the Prime Minister gave us hope. We thought that they were going to resettle them somewhere but to date, there is nothing that they have done for these families.

On 3 March 2020, they called for a meeting with these families together with some of us as their leaders and they were wondering whether Government was considering them as Ugandans or Congolese. Actually, in Congo, they are not wanted because they are Bakiga and Banyarwanda of Uganda. Some of these offices told me that I should not raise the issue here that they were to sort it and make sure that everything goes on well. However, we are very disappointed that the Office of the Prime Minister has kept quiet since that time. None of the children who were in primary schools last year has attended school. 

People have literally lost everything. As I talk, some good families who had decided to host some of these families, I think they are becoming tired because there are two parishes affected. People are now sleeping in the schools, in trading centres and others just go to sleep in the compound of Bwindi Hospital.

THE SPEAKER: What are your prayers? Other Members have issues to raise. 

MS KARUNGI: My prayers area:

    1. Government organises food for these families because they are starving.
    2. Government should also look for land somewhere to settle these people immediately because it is too much and it is beyond what somebody can describe. 

I thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: I do not know what the Government will tell us on the issue of resettling those people who are at the border of Congo and Uganda in Kanungu.     

12.57
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Matia Kasaija): Madam Speaker, I do not want to repeat myself. As I said, if we would get these concerns in writing, then it would help us to take a decision quickly. Therefore, I would like to ask my daughter, hon. Karungi, to give us her request in writing just like I have asked hon. Ssekikubo. We would then be able to move quickly and take a decision. That is what I can say.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable member, please, write; it is better. Give the copies to the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development.

MR KASAIJA: Give me those letters if you have done it already. Thank you.

12.58
MR JAMES WALUSWAKA (NRM, Bunyole County West, Butaleja): Thank you, Madam Speaker. Yesterday, when hon. Kyambadde was appearing on Morning Breeze on NBS together with Mr Simon Kaggwa Njala, the presenter of NBS, they disobeyed the Presidential order of social distancing. (Interjections) It is on record. My phone is off but I can charge and honourable minister, I will replay it for you. 

Hon. Kyambadde did not observe the four metres. That is why, Madam Speaker, you have hired these tents for us because of the four metres. They were seated together and hon. Kyambadde touched on Mr Kaggwa Njala and asked him, “Why don’t you ask me the question of money.” The Cabinet minister touched on Mr Kaggwa Njala. 

Madam Speaker, my prayers area:

    1. These two people should be charged with attempted murder because they did not follow the Presidential guidelines.
    2. NBS as an institution should be brought to the Committee on Information, Communication Technology and National Guidance to ask – because we thought these journalists are professionals. How can somebody ask you,  “Ask me this?” (Laughter) 

Madam Speaker, I have another issue. One of our own, hon. Robert Kyagulanyi, my good brother Bobi Wine returned the money as per the directives of the Clerk to Parliament. However, on the deposit slip, he said he had returned a bribe and this is on record. Prime Minister, from here, I will give you a copy. 

My prayer is that hon. Kyagulanyi should come and explain to the House and the country. Who gave the bribe, why and the person who has taken the bribe should be arrested. Therefore, he must be put to order and explain.

Madam Speaker, people now think that this House can be bribed to do its mandated duty of appropriation – (Interruption)

MR OBOTH: Madam Speaker, I have not been on the roster for a while. However, what hon. Waluswaka is raising is a very fundamental issue.  

This is a family called Parliament. We are the children of this House. If we go out and expose the nakedness of our mother and our father; do we still belong to this family? You go and state that the House had given you a bribe? Is that blackmail or portraying bad intention? A member loses a debate here and goes to court? 

If it requires us to amend our rules and amend the law, we should. This ping-pong should stop. This is Parliament –(Applause) – and Parliament must be Parliament. Why do they expose us as if we are all the same? Somebody who came here saying – the other day when hon. Kyagulanyi was donating 25 tonnes of Posho, was it a bribe? He should never take Ugandans for a ride. If he takes Ugandans for a ride, it should not be in this Parliament. (Applause)

MR WALUSWAKA: Finally, honourable minister, you are now aware that food is only going to be distributed in Kampala, Wakiso, Mukono and possibly Mpigi. Some of our voters will not access this food and so, I do not know. Otherwise, the issues of hon. Kyambadde and hon. Kyagulanyi are critical. Thank you. 

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, on the issue of food, I would like to remind you that Government sent Shs 165 million to every district. From yesterday, you are now members of the district taskforce in your districts. Please go and sit with them. Some of that money should be used to buy food because you are free to decide how you are going to use it. 

Concerning the indiscipline, I think we need to take action. How can a minister solicit – because I saw the video, “Mbuuza ku by’essente” that is what she said – and then dramatically, she rejects. This is a minister who comes here and we support her. Yesterday, we passed her budget in her absence. How could she then embarrass the House? People will have to answer. 

We are going to take action on the Members who are indisciplined. Hon. Kyagulanyi, after making a statement, will appear before the Committee on Rules, Privileges and Discipline, for bringing the House into disrepute. I will tell you what we shall do with the others. (Applause)

1.05
THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Ms Betty Aol): Madam Speaker, we cannot only focus on the Shs 165 million, which is everywhere yet we see billions and billions of donations coming in, including what some members of Parliament are donating even when their districts are not targeted. That is very unfair to the people of Uganda who are upcountry. 

We need to focus and also know that vulnerability is not only in Wakiso and Kampala City; it is everywhere. We cannot just talk about the Shs 165 million per district; that is our cry to the country. 

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I think you are aware that the Government has no intention of distributing food elsewhere except in Kampala and Wakiso. For a whole month now, we have been asking Government when they will target the rest of Uganda; we have received no answer - (Interjection) - yes, it is true. 

Where is the plan for the country? When will you go to Gulu? When will you go to Kisoro? When will you go to Kamuli? We have been asking for a plan and you do not have it because you do not want to supply food to the rest of the country. 

1.07
MR ABBAS AGABA (NRM, Kitagwenda County, Kitagwenda): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. Finally, we are coming close to reality. It has been a long journey and we have been asking Government for a long time - initially, I remember the House took a decision that Government does not start the process of distribution of food until we are clear of the nation-wide programme of reaching everybody in the country, even when they covered themselves under the guise that they were giving food to only those affected by the directives of the President on COVID-19. Our understanding and reality that time was that the whole country has such people in the various constituencies. 

However, Government went ahead and started food distribution despite the position of Parliament that they should not. We understandingly let it pass because there were people who had been heavily affected since it was almost 10 days into the lockdown and they had not yet got food. 

Starting with Wakiso and Kampala Metropolitan, the understanding was that the Government would reach everybody affected by the current situation. I think we need to put our foot on the ground as Parliament. Yes, the Shs 165 million has come to everybody, including those who have got food. Thank you. We shall monitor it. We shall be involved and see how it is used. 

However, as that goes on, when is Government going to your people outside Kampala Metropolitan, affected by the President’s directives on COVID-19, to give them food? The lockdown was ordered and later, it was extended for three weeks. Are you waiting for the three weeks to end to tell them that there is nothing? 

We are getting pressure from the constituencies. I got disturbed by this barrage on social media concerning the Shs 20 million, making us appear funny and foolish in the eyes of the public? There is pressure on it because the public is waiting for Government to act and Government has not acted. Our voters are calling us on telephone. We are asking Government but Government is hiding under the table.

Let Government come out clearly to tell us that they are not going to distribute food in the villages because that will help us to find alternatives through which to take care of our people. We shall be aware and take care of it at that time. 

Otherwise, we are waiting for Government, which Government is not acting yet we cannot give. I see some colleagues are now getting food to give out to people. What direction are we taking? Yes, we shall monitor the Shs 165 million. We will prioritise part of it to buy food but Government, where are you? What should we tell the people? That you have abandoned them by not coming to give them food or the money you have sent is the one to be used to buy food? 

Madam Speaker, I request that we put our foot on the ground as Parliament on this until we are sure of what to –(Interruption)  

MR GAFABUSA: Thank you, hon. Agaba, for giving way. The information I would like to give to the House is that as we talk about the said Shs 165 million sent to the districts, I read the guidelines from the Ministry of Local Government, signed by the Permanent Secretary, showing the breakdown of that Shs 165 million but that breakdown does not include food. 

There is no money provided for food in the Shs 165 million that was sent to the districts; there is nothing completely because I read the guidelines.

1.11
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Matia Kasaija): Madam Speaker, my colleague there is spot on. The Shs 165 million does not include food. It is meant to buy fuel for the taskforce to move around, to help those who are already sick – (Interjections) – I know. It is meant to get samples, which are to be taken to Entebbe. Therefore, it does not include food. It is a new situation that has arisen and I have told you that this Government is there because of the people. 

Madam Speaker, I would like to give Parliament assurance that I am taking the message to the Prime Minister. The committee is meeting again on Tuesday to look at the possibility of taking food upcountry. People have contributed food and cash; the latest information I have is that we have Shs 5 billion. With some of that money, we have a little more capacity to spread into the countryside and serve people who are vulnerable, suffering and are starving. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Minister, we shall believe you when you give us an action plan with timelines, including where you are starting and where you are ending. Let us have hon. Kumama.

1.13
MR GEORGE KUMAMA (NRM, Bbaale County, Kayunga): Thank you, Madam Speaker, for this opportunity. I would like us to understand two things; there is the COVID-19 intervention that we are tussling with and there are the other Government interventions under the disaster preparedness ministry. 

The water level on Lake Victoria has risen. When it gets to that level, River Nile is also affected. All the water that flows along River Nile actually ends up in my place in Galilaya and your place in Bukungu. That water goes and floods that area totally. 

It has affected many villages, including Ntimba Parish in Galilaya sub-county. The whole parish is cut off and people cannot cross to the other side of Kawongo. Therefore, they need urgent interventions. Surrounding villages like Kyedikyo, Misozi and Kitwe are all cut off. This is a fishing community but the people cannot go fishing – (Member timed out.)

THE SPEAKER: Fortunately, before you came, the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development was told about the situation in the other islands on Lake Victoria and he said they are going to rescue them. Please evacuate the people of Bbaale.

MR KUMAMA: Especially Kawongo. The whole of Ntimba Parish is cut off and it has over 5,000 people. It is a huge landing site. It has been cut off and people cannot even come out because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I suggest that Government rescues that area with interventions - particularly food - and others can follow. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

1.16
MR RICHARD GAFABUSA (NRM, Bwamba County, Bundibugyo): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise on a matter of national importance regarding the plight of the people of Bundibugyo who have suffered since December last year. 

Last year I raised, on the Floor of this House, the issue of land masses sinking with people’s houses and gardens. You guided and the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development sent experts to Bundibugyo to study what the problem was but to date, they have not issued a report. 

In December, Bundibugyo was hit by landslides and floods that devastated the entire district. The Rt Hon. Prime Minister and his entire team went there. The Committee on Presidential Affairs also went there. I remember when the vice-chairperson of the committee went to the affected areas, she actually cried. 

The people who were affected were put in internally displaced people’s camps until mid-January when the schools were about to open. The Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) said that we have to let people go and find where they can stay with relatives because all their houses were destroyed. The OPM was supposed to do a comprehensive assessment to support these people. Madam Speaker, people are still staying with relatives, friends and neighbours and they have nothing to eat. We are now in a total lockdown and you can imagine the situation they are in.

Secondly, the landslides destroyed majority of our gravity flow schemes. We are in the mountains and we depend on gravity to get water. We now have two sub-counties - Bubukwanga and Tokwe - that do not have water completely. We have two sub-counties that are cut off completely and you cannot reach there with a vehicle. You can imagine how they are implementing the COVID-19 guidelines. If they have sick people, they cannot put them on a motorcycle and a vehicle cannot reach there and UNRA was supposed to come and help make these areas accessible.

Madam Speaker, my prayer is that as we give resources to the districts, districts like Bundibugyo need affirmative action. The Office of the Prime Minister has records of the people who were affected. The Committee on Presidential Affairs went there and saw that there are people who can never go back to their homes because their land was literally swept away. All their houses were swept away. These people have nothing to eat, as we talk. Can the Government respond before we hear that people have starved to death? Thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: The Prime Minister is listening; this is an old matter. Really, it is very annoying. First of all, the honourable member warned about the potential for landslides. The ministry sent people there, the boulders moved -

1.20
MR JOHNSON MUYANJA (NRM, Mukono County South, Mukono): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise on a matter concerning your sons and daughters in the Police Force. We have a number of policemen and women who have been deployed and are on duty but they have not accessed their salaries for over a year now.

Madam Speaker, a big number of policemen and women are affected and it might be the cause of the brutality – because they are not happy. (Laughter) They are deployed and are on duty but they are not paid. Whenever they go to Naguru, they are bounced. For those who are in the VIP section, whenever they go to Nsambya, they are told, “Go to Naguru.” It has taken over a year. 

Last August, I approached the headquarters at Naguru and they told me, “Honourable, we are handling this and within a very short time, this will be sorted”. Madam Speaker, since August up to now – these people have families. Even the police officers have not received posho, as they were promised, yet they have family members.

THE SPEAKER: Is it posho from the Task Force?

MR JOHNSON MUYANJA: Yes.

THE SPEAKER: They have not been given.

MR JOHNSON MUYANJA: They have not received posho. Madam Speaker, the traffic police we see on the streets have families. However, my main concern is about their pay. How can you deploy someone who is armed and not paid for over a year?

My prayer is that the police department should use part of the supplementary budget to clear our sons and daughters who are suffering. Otherwise, they are on duty. How can you deploy someone has a case on duty? The person is armed and on patrol unit. In fact, some of them guard Very Important Persons (VIP) and us. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, obviously, we cannot resolve that they use the supplementary for this or that. That is for the minister. However, I think the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development must find a solution for the Uganda Police Force.  Honourable minister, we shall call you after.

1.23
MR APOLLO MASIKA (NRM, Bubulo County East, Namisindwa): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise on an issue concerning my constituency, Namisindwa. Namisindwa is found on the border of Kenya. When we talk about it, many people tend to forget it. Otherwise, it is a route from Mombasa to Mbale.

The truck drivers that used to pass through Busia and Malaba have been diverted and they are coming through this border. When these drivers come, they drink bottles of water and then throw the empty bottles on the road and then children run after the empty bottles and fill them with water and drink. Madam Speaker, when I hear that the truck drivers have been caught, I get worried about my people in Namisindwa.

Secondly, the Police Station in Namisindwa has no vehicle yet we have a very long border, where they can intercept the drivers coming from Kenya. In addition, the COVID-19 suspects quarantined at Magali Hospital come out freely and mix with people. They look for food and play football. Now, what kind of quarantine is this? We are really worried. 

We, therefore, request the Office of the Prime Minister to give these people food. They are now calling their Members of Parliament to give them food in hospitals and other places. In fact, when they heard about the Shs 20million, the entire constituency wrote messages that they should get food. Madam Speaker, there are many things happening in Namisindwa.

Furthermore, the landslide - 

THE SPEAKER: Just make your prayers.

MR MASIKA: Madam Speaker, we have people who had settled in landslide areas but later migrated to the homes of their friends and relatives from 2007. In fact, I took the Minister of Relief, Disaster Preparedness and Refugees to see this. People from Buwere and all those ranches have come with their cows, pigs, bananas - and people are very hungry. They do not have any food.

I would like to call upon the Office of the Prime Minister to consider our issues. Otherwise, only 18 out of the 200 people who were supposed to be taken to Bulambuli were relocated. I, therefore, request the Office of the Prime Minister to look into our issue as soon as possible. Thank you very much.

THE SPEAKER: Minister of Finance, did you want to say something about the police or will you first listen to other Members? 

1.26
MR ASUMAN BASALIRWA (JEEMA, Bugiri Municipality, Bugiri): Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter related to the legal regime under which, the country is being run at the moment.

Madam Speaker, the learned Attorney-General appeared before this House about two weeks ago and tabled a statutory instrument, where the presidential directives had been reduced into an enforceable legal instrument.

The directives in that statutory instrument expired. The President issued fresh directives that will expire on 5 May 2020. Unfortunately, since then, the Attorney-General, the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs and the Minister of Health have not issued a statutory instrument to put in force the directives of the President.

Madam Speaker, what is happening is that there is no law, whatsoever, governing the directives of the President. I have said here before that presidential directives do not constitute law. Since there is that lacuna, law enforcement officers are behaving in any way. Even the complaints you are hearing here – The President said, “You will be charged of attempted murder if you are found distributing food.”

With due respect, Madam Speaker, the Public Health Act, under which those directives are issued - (Interjection) - As I speak, one of our colleagues, hon. Francis Zaake, is in Naguru Hospital. He was arrested and beaten allegedly for distributing food. I was there yesterday and I asked the Officer in Charge Criminal Investigation Department (OCCID) why he is not being produced in court, after 48 hours. They are still debating whether to charge him with attempted murder or not. I told them it is not provided anywhere under our laws.

Madam Speaker, the President issued directives but those directives are not in the statuary instruments. The four meters, the role of the Resident District Commissioner (RDC) and even issues to do with the boda bodas and the curfew are not reflected anywhere.

My prayer - and I have said it before that if the President and Government are finding it difficult to lead the country under the Public Health Act, they have an option of declaring a State of Emergency. The President has deliberately failed to do so yet, when he is speaking, he talks about a public health emergency. 

Madam Speaker, even under our laws, the Emergency Powers Act, which this Parliament enacted - what is happening in this country is synonymous with what happens in a State of Emergency. I do not know why they are shy to declare so. The right to a fair trial is one of the non-derogable rights but it is not happening now. The lawyers who are supposed to be partners in that right are not an essential service. People are languishing in prisons and police cells.

My prayer is that Government, the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs should issue a statutory instrument to reflect the new directives of the President.

Finally, lawyers should be an essential service. Article 44 is very clear. Legal representation is a non-derogable right and it is one of the aspects of fair trial. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I think they are afraid to proceed under State of Emergency because they will be obliged to report to the House about the exercise of those powers. I think that is what they are afraid to proceed under a State of Emergency because they will be obliged to report to the House about the exercise of those powers. I think that is what they are afraid of.

1.31
MR JACOB OBOTH (Independent, West Budama County South, Tororo): Madam Speaker, hon. Asuman Basalirwa is a Member of the Legal Committee and I agree with him entirely. The hesitation to provide a legal regime upon which what is going on can be translated into pieces of legislation that can govern this country is either an Act or omission intended to cause confusion or to paralyse this country after the lockdown. 

This is not the only country with CVID-19; what is peculiar here? Just because we have not had any deaths or are we preparing for more deaths so that we make the necessary laws?

I have taken initiative to read, right from developed democracies like America; when they have a disaster – like the Hurricane Katrina - they legislate. This Parliament has been available and whatever the President wanted to do - he may not necessarily do it under the Public Health Act - you can bring Bills here and they are legislated within one day. Somebody must be either shy or not ready to provide the core legal advice to the President. He is well intended; Ugandans are all complying but we cannot keep watching. 

The Public Health Act may not necessarily give the President all these powers but in what whatever we do, in a State of Emergency or situations like these, you have to provide laws that will protect this country against the evil of omission or commission.

There are certain things that are going to be done which are not right but have to be done because we are protecting the lives of the majority. There are things that may not be done because you are protecting the lives of the majority. The President is not far away from you, in between you and the President there is the Vice President who was also a Speaker. 

Madam Speaker, my humble appeal to you as a senior lawyer – and I must thank the Minister of Finance, he did a wonderful job today to give us hope in all what he has handled. Madam Speaker, this is a matter on which you would interact with the President. In matters of emergencies, legislations are done - countries like Botswana, even Kenya - what the President is saying has a citation. When our President is saying all these, what is the citation? And this is in good faith. 

Madam Speaker, I would like to implore you; he is your big brother and he is just next door after His Excellency, Edward Ssekandi. Find time to have a conversation over a cup of tea observing social distancing –(Laughter)– and find middle ground because nobody should deceive Ugandans that this lockdown is ending tomorrow, unless you are not following what is going on in other countries. 

As long as we have porous borders, people are jumping through other places between Busia and Tororo. There is no border but people are running into Uganda to take refuge. This is not to going to end tomorrow, let us prepare a legal regime that can be given the effect of law. I beg to submit. 

THE SPEAKER: Thank you, very much, honourable chairperson of Legal and Parliamentary Affairs. 

1.37 
MS FRANCA AKELLO (FDC, Woman Representative, Agago): Thank you, Madam Speaker. Last week, I raised a matter that needed urgent attention to the Minister of Internal Affairs or whoever was concerned and you ably ruled that the minister comes with a statement on Tuesday this week in response to what actions have been taken. 

Madam Speaker, this is in regard to the plight of the dumb and deaf man who was shot on 7th this month in the process of implementing the curfew by an LDU in Adilang sub-county. This disabled person was shot and by that time, when I presented the matter, he was being nursed at Kalongo Hospital. However, as I speak, his left leg has been amputated so he has got a third disability. 

You directed that the minister comes here with a statement stating clearly what actions they have taken but to my dismay, I would like to inform this House and Uganda that this poor man is languishing in the hospital but Government has not taken any action in helping him and in apprehending the perpetrators of this illegal Act. 

It beats my understanding how an LDU shoots someone on sight and that someone is in the hospital and nobody takes care of that; up to now, the person is in the hospital but more so the LDU is at large. Where is justice in this country? 

The only way a Member of Parliament can represent their people is to speak and bring the issue on the Floor of Parliament. If action is not taken, I do not know whether it does not tantamount to Government inciting some of us leaders to take radical actions, which may not be legal and I do not want to go that direction. 

Secondly, Madam Speaker, I also raised a matter concerning the disturbances of the Karimojong cattle thieves who raided Paimol Sub County last week and Lapono sub-county the other week and injured eight of my people, who are at the moment in the hospital. I raised the same matter here and you ably ruled that the ministers come and respond to actions taken as far as the plight of these people is concerned but up to now, nobody has brought a statement on this Floor. So, my issue is mainly procedural to find out what steps I should take. 

The families of these victims are asking for what actions they should take and what we should do. I pray that some response is brought before this House so that I can be able to give an appropriate response to the concerned people. Thank you very much.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, those two issues will be reflected on the Order Paper next Tuesday. Therefore, the ministers are given notice that they must come here to answer those questions.

MR JACOB OPOLOT (Independent, Pallisa County, Pallisa): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise on an important issue to do with the senior citizens’ grant. I raise this concern, emanating from the directive given by the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, through the PS/ST, instructing on payments during this COVID-19 period. 

This, unfortunately, clearly states the areas such as salaries, wages and pensions for all MDAs and local Governments. It talks about payments to the Ministry of Health and security sectors but leaves out the senior citizens’ grant, stating it as - or implying that it is - one of the least of priorities, as far as payments are concerned around this period.

Madam Speaker, you are aware that this money goes to people who are already weak and vulnerable. For the finance ministry to exclude them, in terms of payments, is sentencing them to death. We have talked about the issue of food in this country at this time. Many parts of this country are excluded from those benefitting in terms of food distribution. That, therefore, means that older persons in the rest of the country, where the senior citizens’ grant has been helping, are being excluded.

I, therefore, wish to appeal to the finance ministry to clearly state to us how best we can help this vulnerable category, in terms of making their payments because that money is for their food and medication. What can we do about this? Can we include this? 

As far as I know, the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development, through expansion of the Social Protection II programme, are ready to pay. They have the money, which is a combination of donor partners’ and Government of Uganda’s contribution. They are ready to pay, following the Ministry of Health guidelines.

Therefore, can you clearly help us on this and make sure that the senior citizens’ grant is included among the priority payments in order to save the senior citizens from the hardships they are going through? Thank you, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: The minister will answer when he is responding to the other issues.

1.45
MR CHARLES GUTOMOI (FDC, Erute County North, Lira): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to take this opportunity, first and foremost, to thank the community of Acholi Sub-region for their humility and friendship to welcome our people from Lango Sub-region to go and hire land for farming in Acholi Sub-region, especially in Pader, Kitgum, Lamwo, Nwoya and Omoro.

This morning, I received a very sad report from Lamwo, where we lost one of our voters called Geoffrey Amalo, who had hired land in Lamwo for farming. He was a resident of Padibe West. I am told that last night, according to the RDC Lamwo, a young child was screaming for help. Her mother rose up to help because she was complaining that somebody was about to kill her with a spear. 

In an attempt by the mother to rescue the child, she also collapsed. She was calling her husband for help that she was about to be killed by somebody about to spear her. When the man woke up to help his wife, he collapsed and never rose back to life. The DPC told me that they sent a team of doctors. However, it has scared the whole of Padibe because that has been happening for some time.

My prayer, Madam Speaker, is on how to retrieve the body of the late Geoffrey Amalo to Erute County North in Lira. Allow me to also –

THE SPEAKER: What do you want Parliament to do?

MR GUTOMOI: About the LDUs who have not been paid; it has been reliably found that since these LDUs were recruited in July last year - they were recruited on 26 July – up to date, as they operate under this lockdown, they have not been paid. 

Evidence has been noted. When the Minister of State for Defence and Veteran Affairs, hon. Okello Engola, went to Lira, he announced that he was going to use his methods to beat up people in Lira and even kill them, if they did not obey the presidential directives. 

Many people were beaten and their property was destroyed, especially those who were selling commodities along the road. It was during day, Madam Speaker. That is proof that these people have not been paid. As such, whenever they are moving, one disappears and goes to harass the community for some help.

Therefore, may I, in my prayer, find out from Government why these people have not yet been paid, including some police constables? This is becoming a problem in the communities where they should be assisting. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.

THE SPEAKER: Fortunately, the Government is listening. I hope the minister will be able to respond.

1.49
THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Ms Betty Aol): Thank you, Madam Speaker. This time of the lockdown is a critical moment for everybody. You will find that if you have something somewhere, it disturbs you when you want to get it, especially if it is money.

We know about the Ugandans who trade in South Sudan. The minister has been pushing for these traders. Now that the Budget has been passed today, I am sure it has reduced a bit of pressure on the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. 

Honourable minister, if you were the one with your resources somewhere else and you are really hard-up, put yourself in their shoes. You will find that if these people had power, they would have even fought you. So, can you do something, probably next week, since we have just been handling this Budget today? Do something to help these people. We are pleading with you. My prayer is that you should take that as top priority in your other priorities.

I would also like to say that we sit here - we are about 80 members of Parliament sitting here on behalf of all the MPs. When it comes to the councils, right now, councils sit and when they do, only five members of the business committee sit. The rest of the council members do not sit. And when it comes to payment – 80 of us meet here but we all get paid. However, for the district councillors, only those who attend the council meeting are paid a sitting allowance.

Therefore, my plea again goes to the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, together with the Minister for Local Government, to see how they can help the honourable councillors. They are hard up and I keep telling those in my district to help the vulnerable people though they keep coming to me to help them first yet I and them have to help the elderly, people with disability and those sick with HIV/AIDS in advanced stages.

Instead of the honourable councillors looking at us, let us see how those two ministers can help them to also get something. Treat them the way you are treating us here. Even when we are all not here, we are all paid. Let them also be paid the allowances they deserve. 

Like for the rest of this year, many of the councillors have not been paid anything except those who do business for the councils. Thank you.

1.53
MS JANE NABULINDO (Independent, Woman Representative, Busia):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise on a matter of national importance. Busia border has 200 porous border points yet we only have 60 security personnel in the district. The truck drivers being tested are the only ones entering Uganda through the known customs border points. Otherwise, those entering through entry points such as Sofia, Alupe and elsewhere, are not tested.

THE SPEAKER: But, hon. Nabulindo, isn’t that the same matter you raised early this week? You raised it; I gave you an opportunity and you raised it. 

MS NABULINDO: They are not testing those who are entering. Secondly, Madam Speaker, the people of Busia will die of hunger even before COVID-19 takes their lives because they have been depending on cross-border trade but as you are aware, the border was closed.

Therefore, I call upon the ministry concerned to at least supply the people of Busia with food. People are crying and calling us on telephone, day and night and asking us to buy them food yet, we cannot afford buying food for people in the whole district.

I call upon the Office of the Prime Minister – Busia people keep seeing donors hand over food to Government officials and so, they know the food is there and they also need a share of that food. Thank you.

1.55
MR DONONZIO MUGABE KAHONDA (NRM, Ruhinda County, Mitooma): Thank you so much, Madam Speaker. Everyone in this country is crying of hunger; we need food. I remember very well, when the  price of maize went down to as low as Shs 200, this Parliament passed a resolution urging the  Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to release Shs 100 billion to help and buy maize from the farmers at reasonable prices.

Surprisingly, Madam Speaker, when this crisis came up, I saw officials from the Office of the Prime Minister being arrested for hiking the maize flour price to as high as Shs 3,500. Yet we had provided money to help companies buy this maize from farmers at a reasonable price. At that time, the prices had gone to as low as Shs 200. 

Madam Speaker, a question was raised in this House to the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and you directed that the minister tables a list of companies that benefited from the  Shs 100 billion but up to date, that list has never been provided.

Secondly, this Parliament passed a loan to boost the agriculture sector in this country, in terms of value addition and supply chain in the various districts whereupon Mitooma District that houses my constituency, would have been a beneficiary.

My prayers are:

    1. That the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, tables a list of companies that benefited from Shs 100 billion. Actually, the Government should not be buying maize flour at Shs 3,500 or whichever cost when we provided money to buy maize when prices were as low as Shs 200; and

    2. Madam Speaker, let the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development explain to the country what happened to the loan that Parliament passed to boost the agriculture sector in this country.

I thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you. Fortunately, the horse himself is here.

1.58
MR TERRENCE ACHIA (NRM, Bokora County, Napak): Madam Speaker, aware that this is the month of April, the month of rains in most parts of the country, some of us have the seeds for planting that we would wish to take to our constituents. However, in the current circumstances, I do not know whom to contact to grant me a movement permit to deliver these seeds to the people in my constituency. 

Secondly, Madam Speaker, Karamoja Sub Region has a lot of challenges. Apart from the COVID-19 and locusts invasion, the cattle rustlers from Turkana are giving the Karimojong headache. They do not know about the COVID-19 lockdown. I believe the Minister of Defense and Veteran Affairs and the Minister of Internal Affairs have been getting reports from the UPDF division commanders. In a series of cattle raids by the Turkana from Kenya in this lockdown, a lot of cattle have been stolen by them. 

My appeal to the Minister of Defense and Veteran Affairs is for him to support the UPDF division commanders in the Karamoja Sub Region, by increasing the number of soldiers deployed along the Uganda-Kenya Border, to protect the Karimojong from the Turkana cattle rustlers. That is my greatest appeal. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Terence Achia, on the question you are moving, as of yesterday, the Government agreed that Members of Parliament can move to their constituencies using their Parliament identity cards. Therefore, you can go to your constituency. Otherwise, on the other issues regarding security, you will get the answers from elsewhere.

2.00
MS JESCA ABABIKU (NRM, Woman Representative, Adjumani): Thank you, Madam Speaker, for the opportunity. I have one matter of concern. This morning I received a telephone call from Adjumani over the new innovation on ensuring that learning continues from homes. The Minister of Education and Sports is using radio programmes to do this but this has not been effected in Adjumani; it is only in Moyo District.

However, the bigger concern I have is, the urban centres are more advantaged than the rural centres. Concerning television stations - yes, people have rights to have them but it depends on your capacity. Some of these are secondary to the needs of those who are in abject poverty.

Therefore, Madam Speaker, as I appreciate the innovations in the education sector, my request is, let the minister or the ministry come here and we discuss these innovations so that they does not create a gap between the poor and the rich.

Secondly, I request that the ministry should consider the special interest needs of some of the categories, for example, those with hearing impairment. Even if you are talking using radio programmes, they will not be able to hear. Those with sight problems will not be able to see what you are demonstrating. Madam Speaker, if we do not address this, it is going to create a big gap between those who can afford this new technology and those who cannot. 

Regarding the issue of power, Adjumani District has unreliable power. Therefore, unless some of these key indicators are handled - Madam Speaker, if we cannot manage continuous learning, we should announce to this country that this is a dead term rather than favouring people who can afford and disadvantaging those who cannot. Thank you so much.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, hon. Ababiku has raised a very important point. Apparently, increasingly, the Government is operating at the Media Centre. You just hear that the minister addressed the nation, the minister said this but they do not come to this House. We do not know what they said there, we want to know but they are not here. 

I would like to urge the Government to understand that this is where the people’s representatives are and sometimes, we need to discuss with you, your policies. Therefore, the Minister of Education should come here and update us so that we have a debate and we can understand how the country is going to fit in the new plans. Can I invite the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs? He wanted to say a few things.

2.03
THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Prof. Ephraim Kamuntu): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I appreciate your stamina and steadfastness in piloting the House during a very difficult time. The Americans will say, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going. I think you are really tough and we are getting going. 

I wanted to respond very quickly to issues raised by hon. Asuman and complemented by hon. Oboth, the Chairman of the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee on the legal regime under which the directives of the President are being implemented.

It is very true, Madam Speaker, that the Executive authority of this country is vested in the President and he must exercise that authority in accordance with the Constitution and the law and that is what is being done.

Statutory instruments have been issued under the Health Act and the situation is under constant review that once this situation does not improve, more measures will be introduced but they must be done in accordance with Constitution.

I would like to agree with hon. Oboth totally. In the Order of Precedence, the President takes precedence over all the people of Uganda and in descending order, he is followed by the Vice President and, Madam Speaker, you are the third. If we put the fourth, it is the Chief Justice.

I am sure that Ugandans would be very pleased to see the President, the Speaker and the Chief Justice having a cup of tea on a matter, which really does not emphasise separation of powers but rather harmonising powers to address an emergency situation. 

I am sure we shall get through this situation once that harmonisation of efforts is done. If the situation requires a state of emergency, I am sure it would be done but in accordance with the law. That is really the position. 

I just want to emphasise, honourable members, that as a Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, we strictly adhere to the rule of law in everything we do. Whether it is our forces or our citizens, this is a cardinal principle where democracies can only survive if this principle is adhered to.

Madam Speaker, I have spoken to the Prime Minister on the issue of distribution of food across the country. You may want to know that I was once Chairman of the National Allocation Committee after the 1979 war. Allocating food is a very sensitive and difficult exercise. 

Therefore, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development will emphasise a roll-out plan, which will be debated in this House but has to be very carefully gone through. Distributing food and scarce commodities exposes the worst in human beings. I have seen people being allocated in Kawempe, going to Rubaga, Namirembe - Everywhere they are allocating, the people are following to get and they will accumulate the food and sell it. The law of economics is that on one hand, people will be suffering and others want to make money out of this confusion. That is what the human nature is all about and we must be vigilant. 

All I am pleading for is that this situation is trying and members, we must be analytical and focus on the underlying causes of this situation before we begin blaming each other on effects and consequences. Thank you, Madam Speaker, for your stamina.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, if you could respond and then we go back to our other business. 

2.08
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Matia Kasaija): Madam Speaker, I do not intend to repeat the answers I gave to the questions as the members were contributing. 

I will start with the case of Bundibugyo. All I can say is that I will carry the message to the Prime Minister and ask him to give us an answer as to why action has not been taken despite him having visited the locus.

Regarding some police officers not having received their salaries for months, that is true. The problem has been cash flow. However, I would like to assure this House that with this new financial year, this problem should be sorted out quickly - not even before this quarter. I have been told that some funds have already been sent to the authorities to pay the salaries of the police officers who have not been receiving their salaries.

Regarding Namisindwa, I will carry your case and take it to the Prime Minister. About Bukwo and the lack of vehicles, now that we have vehicles to help us fight COVID-19, I think you should be able to get a vehicle. I will plead your case with the committee that is allocating these vehicles.

About presidential directives, my colleague has answered that so I do not need to repeat it.

Concerning the senior citizens grants, Madam Speaker, let me just give you a little bit of background so that we understand how we came about this. This is a facility, which I don’t need to preach to you because you all know. It was initiated by the British Government in recognition of our people who have not worked in civil service or anywhere, yet they have contributed significantly to this country. 

We embraced it and started with 40 districts and the intention was to roll it over. However, colleagues, the problem is again, the budget. We are very cautious about this matter. If our budget does permit us I would be the first to send money but the problem is the budget.

The pay to LDUs and police constables, we have provided for that money in the Budget. The only issue is, I don’t know what happens between – Maybe I will come back again once I have got an answer to what will happen between now and the coming financial year. 

The issue on South Sudan traders’ payments, again, the problem is cash. Maybe, let me use this opportunity – Madam Speaker, don’t think that I am preaching to you. The Budget, as you know, we finance it through two ways; either from our own generated revenue; that is why we came here and presented to you a list of tax measures. You said yes, to some of those measures and no, to some of them.

Now, if that is not enough, at times, we get grants from good Samaritans but that is not a sure deal. The next course of action Government does is, to go for borrowing. When I am borrowing, I am also very careful because this country is heavily indebted and I try to avoid that. So, if you don’t see any move, where you have legislated and appropriated, the problem is the cash. We operate a cash budget. There is no way I can pay money out, which I don’t have. Otherwise, I will be breaking the law and we shall be running your economy in –

I have told my colleagues and traders themselves that once our cash position improves, we should be able to fulfil our promise to the people who are involved in the issue of the South Sudan traders. 

Concerning local councillors’ payments, I am reliably informed and as we speak now, we pay Shs 250,000 per month and Shs 55,000 for the sub county per month as well. So, that one is being taken care of. We can crosscheck with our figures but that is the position, my technical people here have advised me.

The Shs 100,000,000,000 for supporting the price of maize grain, we released this money to the Agricultural Credit Scheme but the offtake was very poor; the business community did not pick that money. If they did - I think about two or three cases came to my attention. The business people who are buying the maize did not pick that money. Why? It is because they were not sure of the market. They say, “We buy maize from the people to put in our stores, where do we sell it?” However, that facility as I speak, is still available.

Madam Speaker, these are the questions, to which I thought I had the answers to answer. The loan for agriculture? I will have to check on that one because I am not very conversant on what is happening to that loan. I will come back on that issue, Madam Speaker. Thank you. 

BILLS
SECOND READING
 
THE APPROPRIATION BILL, 2020

2.16
THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (Mr Matia Kasaija): Madam Speaker, I move that the Appropriation Bill, 2020 be read for the second time.

THE SPEAKER: Do you have a report or we just go to the – it is seconded.

2.16
THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON BUDGET (Mr Amos Lugoloobi): Madam Speaker, we were given one hour to consider the Appropriation Bill. I am now begging to present the report of the Committee on Budget on the Appropriation Bill, 2020.

On 31 March 2020, the Appropriation Bill, 2020 was read for the first time and subsequently referred to the Committee on Budget for consideration. 
In accordance with Rules 151 and 173(c), the committee considered the Bill and reports as follows.

Methodology 

The committee held a consultative meeting with the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and examined the Appropriation Bill to ascertain the consistency and accuracy of the estimates as indicated in the schedule to the Appropriation Bill against the allocations made by the Committee of Supply on 23 and 24 April 2020. 

The object of the Bill is to provide for the authorisation of public expenditure out of the Consolidated Fund of a sum of Shs 29,952,727,654,000 only to meet expenditure for the Financial Year 2020/2021.

In terms of the legal framework, Article 156(1) provides: “The heads of expenditure contained in the estimates, other than expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund by this Constitution or any Act of Parliament, shall be included in a Bill to be known as an Appropriation Bill which shall be introduced into Parliament to provide for the issue from the Consolidated Fund of the sums necessary to meet that expenditure and the appropriation of those sums for the purposes specified in the Bill.”

Additionally, Madam Speaker, under Section 14(1) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015: “Parliament shall by the 31st day of May of each year, consider and approve the annual budget and work plan of Government for the next financial year; the Appropriation Bill and any other Bills that may be necessary to implement the annual budget.”

Observations 

Madam Speaker, Parliament on 23 and 24 April 2020, considered and approved the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Government for the Financial Year 2020/2021.

Subsequently, in accordance with Rules 151 and 173 of the Rules of Procedure, the committee examined the proposed allocations per vote as indicated in the schedule to the Bill, and finds that there are several inconsistences with the allocations made by the Committee on Supply on 23 and 24 April 2020.

The committee, therefore, recommends that the figures as allocated per vote in the schedule to the Bill be replaced with the figures per vote as allocated by the Committee of Supply on 23 and 24 April 2020.

Conclusion

The committee recommends that the Appropriation Bill, 2020 be passed into law, subject to the proposed amendments which I will propose at the committee stage. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. 

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I put the question that the Appropriation Bill be read for the second time.

Clause 2

MR LUGOLOOBI: Madam Chairperson, I propose an amendment to clause 2 on the issue of money out of the Consolidated Fund. We are proposing to substitute for the entire clause, the following: “The Treasury may issue out of the Consolidated Fund and apply towards a supply granted to the Government for the service of the year ending 30 June 2021, a sum of Shs 29,998,953,191,000 only.

MR LUGOLOOBI: Madam Chair, we have proposed amendments to the schedule as follows:

    1. Under recurrent expenditure appearing on pages 2-39 in the Bill, replace the supply amounts with supply amounts as contained in schedule (a) recurrent expenditure hereto attached on this report.

    2. Under development expenditure schedule appearing on pages 40-49 in the Bill, replace the supply amounts with the supply amounts as contained in schedule (b) development expenditure hereto attached to this report. 

The justification is for consistency with the allocations made by the Committee of Supply on 23 and 24 April 2020.

THE CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, I put the question that the schedule be amended as proposed.

MR LUGOLOOBI: I am amending the long title. It is a consequential amendment to state that, “An Act to supply a sum of Shs 29,998,953,191,000 only”. The rest remains okay apart from the figures which I have replaced in that text.

A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, “THE APPROPRIATION ACT, 2020”

THE SPEAKER: Title settled and Bill passes. (Applause) Honourable members, that concludes the budgeting process. I would like to thank you very much once again for the patience and the stamina. I would like to thank the Clerk and her staff and all the people who have supported us in these difficult situations. 

Honourable members, I indicated that for next week you will be informed about where we are going to sit. You will be given an alert by Monday so that you know where to go. 

In the meantime, the Ministry of Local Government has brought the standard operating procedures for the funds which are going to the districts. Therefore, I will ask the Clerk to upload them and ensure that the members have got them. Study them and when you go to your district, you will know what to do. Unfortunately, there is no food.

MR KASAIJA: Madam Speaker, I stand here to thank you for having a listening ear. (Applause) Every time I have wanted to have a word with you in the process of this budget formulation and processing, you have given me the time. Therefore, I would like to express my thanks to you for being such a nice mother – listening and giving guidance. I think we should clap for her. (Applause)

I also take this opportunity to thank the members of this House and my state minister, hon. Bahati, and the staff for really having concentrated on this job and for having done the homework, even doing it at night. I thank you. (Applause)

Lastly, I thank the committee. We have worked very closely. I really pray that this spirit of working together – after all we are serving the same people – continues. At times there were situations that arose that wanted to pit us against each other but because of the chairman – actually the two chairmen and they are here – these matters were sorted out very amicably. I really want to thank you.

Last but one, as I told you yesterday, we have passed this Budget in an environment where we are not very sure of the future. In case circumstances change due to the COVID-19 and I come back to this House to make adjustments, please, bear with me.

Lastly, I have promised this House and let me promise again, that I will come back – hopefully next week – to show you how Government intends to move in order to help our business community and the country as far as running this economy is concerned. 

With these words, Madam Speaker, I would like to, once again, thank you and Parliament for having been very cooperative and for having passed this Budget. Let us watch and see where this uncertainty will lead us. I am convinced that, together, we shall win. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Thank you.

MR LUGOLOOBI: Madam Speaker, I rise to perform one important responsibility of laying on Table the minutes and the report that I have just read. I beg to lay. Thank you.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, House adjourned to Tuesday next week at 2.00 p.m.
