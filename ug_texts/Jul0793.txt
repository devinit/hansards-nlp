COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY

THE DEPUTY MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND ECONOMIC PLANNING (Mr. A. Kafumbe Mukasa):  Mr. Chairman, I thank you very much.  I beg to move that the National Resistance Council do resolve itself into a Committee of Supply for consideration and approval of Vote on Account 1993/94 Financial Year.

Mr. Chairman, the hon. Members are aware that the Government Financial Year ended on 30th June, 1993, by that date, the council had not deliberated on the 1993/94 Budget and had not, therefore, considered and approved the appropriation Bill.  In the meantime, it is necessary for the Minister of Finance to provide funds for running Government services.  Section 13(i), of the Public Finance Act, gives the Minister for Finance authority to issue funds from the consolidated funds to account for the purposes of meeting expenditure necessary to carry on the services of the Government until the expiry of four months of the Appropriation Act which ever is earlier.  It is in respect of this provision of the Act that I now move the Motion so that the Council can consider the details of the funds allocated against various Ministries’ Votes and approve on Account so that Ministries can spend such funds.  For example, I would like to inform hon. Rwabita that the claim he was raising yesterday, has been ascertained and therefore, has been provided under this provision under Defence. (Applause)    I appeal to Members who may have genuine claims to approach their appropriate Ministry, I beg to move, Sir.

MR. MANZI TUMUBWEINE (Rukiga County, Kabale):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I beg to support the Motion and in support of that Motion, I beg to make one or two observations.  We are going to approve Vote on Account which is part of this year’s National Budget.  The National Budget of this year has been made in such a way that it was a bit difficult to understand the main objectives.  If the objectives of this Budget were to raise Revenue, then it was fine, however, if this Budget also intended to create an atmosphere of development, then we have a crisis.  Because there are two major objectives in taxation.  One is the development objective and the other one is revenue objective.  The two normally conflict and where they conflict and are not balanced, they create a crisis.  As we talk, it is very difficult for the East African Distillers to sell any carton of Waragi because the tax that intends to raise revenue has created a situation where people cannot buy the Waragi.

MR. MAYANJA NKANGI:  Point of order.  Mr. Chairman, is it in order really for hon. Member now to start debating the Budget itself and not the Motion before the House?

THE CHAIRMAN:  Not in order please.

MR. MANZI TUMUBWEINE:  Mr. Chairman, that one I leave it at that, but I am only arguing that this Budget has a problem which if it is going to create development and yet it is going to stop the industries that are creating the best development, we are going to pass this Budget but my worry and that is why I am raising it now, is whether we shall raise this money even in the first four months to be able to, actually, maintain the flow of cash because we are now operating a cash budget and, therefore, we need to make sure that this money will be able to come in time as we all know we normally finish the debate of this budget by October or September, and if that is the case, shall we have raised the money to actually effect this Vote on Account?  In the management of this Budget this year we hope that there will be timely releases because we have had problems of timely releases.  We also hope that the unit that was set up by the Minister of Finance for monitoring will do its job more efficiently because there seem to be lack of monitoring of the utilisation of the budget and, therefore, lack of proper evaluation of the performance of that Budget.  We also hope that in this coming Budget, diversion and re-allocation will be minimised so that items budgeted for before will be spent on and in the support, I did not see any Vote that is ready for the Constituent Assembly.  

So, I am wondering as to whether, if that is already in the process, that Vote is going to be provided for under a different discussion, because there is no line that is showing that they are, actually, catering for that Constituent Assembly.  I wish to thank the Ministry for having brought this one to us, but I hope that in the future Vote on Account will be discussed, at least, a day before the beginning of the Financial Year so that we do not take a week with other Ministries not having funds on their Accounts.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. WASSWA NKALUBO (Nominated Member):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I stand to support the request by the Minister that we approve these sums of money.  In supporting, I wish to thank the Minister that has tried to give us more details and he has created different units and different Votes.  A case in point is Vote No. 040 that is for the Teaching Service Commission; as the Chairman of PAC recently we have been looking at the performance of the Teaching Service Commission and we found that it was being marginalised.  Now that it has its own Vote, I think it will perform better, if the amounts budgeted are released to this Commission.  While we approve these sums of money as a House, we find that we have received reports that the money is not released as and when approved!  There are those Ministries that are favoured and there are those that do not get releases as and when they require them.  My personal appeal to the Ministry of Finance is that they should try and treat all Ministries equally, because they are Ministries where you find they have surplus and there are Ministries though the money has been released, the release is not approved in time.  

We have been privileged to be advised by the Minister on this release that there is money going to some of these districts, I am worried, individually, when you look at the items - from item 60 up to 62, this is money proposed through the Ministry of Local Government, that the money is going directly, will be spent by the Ministry on these districts.  I do not know whether the Minister is not trying to smuggle in a policy that should be approved by this House.  We have been waiting for the Decentralisation Bill. (Applause)  I do not know whether it is not the one he is smuggling in indirectly.  You see this House has been used to having policy implemented and then we do the rubber-stamping.  

Now, I would appeal that this money should be taken back to the Local Government until we approve, it should be shown under the same Heading.  But well, it could be all right to know that it is going to a particular district so long as it is going to be spent by a Local Government.

MR. MANZI TUMUBWEINE:  Point of information.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think in the process of budgeting we have got to provide for the districts even if we have not passed the law for decentralisation.  Now if we do not pass the law for decentralisation, then the money can go back to Local Government, if we do, then the money will go because we shall not have another time to discuss the same Vote when the law has been passed.

MR. WASSWA NKALUBO:  Well, I appreciate the argument of that hon. Member but normally it is the law first and then you provide.  It cannot be the other way round but well I think my worry is not the money being - my worry is that it could be a way of going around this House to start a policy which we have not approved, otherwise, I am totally agreeable that this money is availed to the districts.  But what I object to is that we implement something which we have not - a law which has not been tabled.

MR. SIBO:  Point of information.  Mr. Chairman, the point is that, you provide - you pass a normal provision, until you pass the policy.  But you do not provide actual amount to be spent, and I would have expected the Minister to provide a nominal being so that later the amount is actually, attached to the -amount being spent is passed when the policy has been passed.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. KAFUMBE MUKASA:  Point of information.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to inform hon. Nkalubo and the hon. Members so that we do not - we get to know what finance is proposing.  There is no proposal here by the Minister for Local Government and I do not want, as Finance, to be derailed because you think we are doing a Local Government Policy.  As you know, according to the law, when you pass expenditure the Secretary to Treasury has the legal power to appoint who will be the accounting officer for the money which you vote.  It is not true that Permanent Secretaries are automatically accounting officers. An accounting officer is an appointment by the Secretary to the Treasury and to day we have in Government people who are accounting officers without necessarily being the Permanent Secretary of the Ministries.  

Now, when you account the money, before, the Secretary to Treasury has been appointing the Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Local Government as the accounting officer to him for that money.  We want in Treasury to ensure that the policies which we ask you to approve go down and be implemented as you approve them, so that when you approve money for feeder roads that money is not diverted to do anything else without our knowledge and, therefore, we intend to go on appointing accounting officers and as low as possible to the ground.  In this respect, we intend for some money here to be spent to appoint certain people, let me say, the district as accounting officers and tell them that this money will be released to their districts which has hitherto been released, but the Accounting Officer had been the Permanent Secretary and, therefore, the Permanent Secretary has taken liberty to decide where to put the money.  This time, Finance wants to know that so much money is going to Kabarole District and not only that money, so much of it is going for feeder roads and we shall audit to make sure that that money goes for feeder roads and report to you.  So these two are different things, these are matters on how we account for the money and who we appoint to account for the money, and how far down we can pin them.   When you debate policy, for us in the Ministry of Finance we cannot dictate to you what policy you approve, that will be another matter for Local Government but new policy or no new policy, we have found it necessary instead of giving block sums in billions to cut down these blocks into small amounts directly to particular districts and to particular activities and the Auditor General will follow the matter right down to the earth.  Now, if you go with the new Local Government Policy -(Interruption)

MR. NDEGE:  Point of order.  Is it in order for the hon. Minister to keep on deliberating when I do not see Iganga District in this list?  I think Iganga District is part of Uganda.

THE CHAIRMAN:  He is quite in order. Proceed hon. Kafumbe Mukasa.  

MR. KAFUMBE MUKASA:  Mr. Chairman, that is exactly why we are holding on Iganga District.  It is because of such leadership that you must hold on and work with them properly but where leadership is already ready to experiment this, we are handling it.  I want to tell you -(Interruption)

MR. NDEGE:  Point of order.  Is it in order for the hon. Minister to use unparliamentary language that, it is the hon. Member from Iganga District?

THE CHAIRMAN:  No, it is not in order.

MR. KAFUMBE MUKASA:  Mr. Chairman, on a serious note, we are trying to find a way because this has been your complaint.  You say we vote here money for feeder roads and at the end of the year, you say that in my district I saw no feeder roads in the whole year and we have not been able as finance to explain to you how that does not happen.  Now, starting with some of the districts, we are telling district leaders and by your action you will tell everybody will know that this year Government subvention to Arua District will be 2.8 billion.  So the leaders from Arua District will know that this money has been voted for Arua District.  Then we shall also show those leaders how we have broken down that 2.8 billion so that on inspecting in Arua District you will know how much money has been voted for you and you can take the local leaders there to task.  Hitherto, it was not clear and if this works properly -(Interruption)

MR. SIBO:  I have been listening to the Deputy Minister on this matter but I am wondering whether he is in order to mislead the House because these thirteen districts are known to be a pilot project in the decentralisation programme and these thirteen districts are being voted for money in this project.  It is in fact a matter of decentralisation; it is not the usual kind of voting otherwise we would be having all the thirty-nine districts here.

THE CHAIRMAN:  He is in order to explain to you.  Proceed please.

MR. KAFUMBE MUKASA:  Mr. Chairman, there are people who are going to do these things and there are people who are going to explain I am not representing here the Ministry of Local Government.  I am representing the Ministry of Finance that accounts for the money.  I am saying for the money, this sum, which will go to these districts, will be broken down as follows.  It does not matter what policy you adopt for Local Government, money will still go to Local district.  And we are saying, in Finance we are trying to start a system that will not give block grants to the Ministry of Local Government because eventually this money whatever the policy is, is passed on to the districts.  For me, I do not see the problem -(Interjection)

THE CHAIRMAN:  Order, order please.

MR. KAFUMBE MUKASA:  You listen -(Interruption)- I am clarifying Give me a chance to clarify the matter -(laughter).  Now, I am saying, Mr. Chairman, that Treasury has decided irrespective of what policy you adopt for Local Government -(Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN:  Order, order. Listen to the information please.

MR. KAFUMBE MUKASA:  Mr. Chairman, the law is that when you appoint, when you approve the expenditure here, in the process of spending this money the Secretary to the Treasury is given power by law to appoint who will be the accounting officer for that money.  The money that is hitherto spent and goes to districts being spent by the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Local Government, is not his duty as Permanent Secretary.  The Secretary to Treasury appoints him.  He is appointed by the Secretary to the Treasury to do that.  The Secretary to the Treasury has decided that the policy of supervising money that it goes down and that is the purpose of the district for which it is meant, he will appoint other people other than the Permanent Secretary only to be Accounting Officer.  I want us to separate these two and I thank you very much.

MR. WASSWA NKALUBO (Nominated Member):  I thank the Deputy Minister for the explanation.  I hope he has managed to inform other Members because he has complicated everything for me.  All I was saying is that, let us hope that the spirit of bringing these items was not to go around the powers of this House of implementing a policy which should have been approved by this House.  That is all I think.  I think we should give the money to the respective Ministries but, as Chairman of Public Accounts Committee, I wish to appeal to the Accounting Officer from the beginning of this financial year, that they minimise misuse of public funds. (Applause)  Well, I have been advised that they should stop, there should be total elimination.  As much as we have been giving money, I think it will be time during this session that we will be given a chance to address the corruption that has been highlighted by Public Accounts Committee.  

Now, we have three reports that are ready for discussion.  It is disheartening having spent a lot of time and a lot of money that these reports are never discussed.  Mr. Chairman, I think we should address ourselves to the corruption which actually is becoming more rampant than it was may be last year.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

MR. BUTAGIRA (Rwampara County, Mbarara):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I rise to support the Motion but in doing so, I have one or two comments to make.  The first one is that we are aware that we are discussing Vote on Account that means passing a third of the projected budget to enable the Government to function.  At the same time, we are also aware that the sum provided for here will eventually have to be approved by Parliament when we have to consider the budget.  Part of this funding will be the result of taxation measures which the hon. Minister announced and I think for his benefit and the benefit of us all, to given an indication of some anxiety that is already being generated will be good and therefore in this respect, I think the Minister should be patient and may be grateful to hear some views at the earlier stage which are going to affect his measures which he announced in the budget, as far as money is concerned and taxation is concerned.

Mr. Chairman, I do not drink alcohol -(Laughter)- but I socialise and in that respect, I visit places where alcohol is consumed and I have noticed of late, Mr. Chairman, that since the hon. Minister announced taxation measures almost all the pubs are empty.  This means that the projected taxation that is going to be raised from tax on beers may not be realised.  

(Interjection)- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The hon. Minister may sit here; think that the money that he is proposing here is going to be raised when in actual fact that is not what is happening.  I know the hon. Minister does not drink and so he may not be aware. What I am saying, it would have been wise in view of what I have said of what is happening, for him to reconsider because if you lower the tax tariffs the more people will consume, the more money will get.  

Having said that, let me comment on one other item and that is Mbarara University.  I notice on the summary of Development Expenditure, the last Item, item 142, summary of Development Expenditure, Item 142, Mbarara University.  It is a pity that since the inception of that University which was started in the buildings which belonged to Midwifery, there is nothing that has been added on that building, not even a small kitchen -(Interjection)- Yes.  Mr. Chairman, if you go there, it is pathetic.  There is nothing that has been done apart from building houses for -(Interruption)

MR. JOHN NTIMBA:  Information.  Mr. Chairman, I beg to inform the hon. Member on the Floor of the House that since the inception of that University, some additional buildings like the staff houses, laboratories and technical things have been added to the University.

MR. BUTAGIRA:  Mr. Chairman, I am surprised.  This hon. Friend was a Minister of State for Education before his retrenchment -(Laughter)- and in fact, the University is situated in his constituency so I am helping him.  All I am saying is that apart from staff houses which I mentioned, if you go to the campus itself, there is - apart from those Midwifery buildings, there is nothing added and mark you, it is a University for Medicine.  The only faculty we have there is the faculty of medicine and adjoining to it, is the hospital that is supposed to be a teaching hospital, it is pathetic, there is absolutely nothing.  All I am saying is that, let us be serious.  You set up a University, please make it functional, do not make it a laughing stock.  Mr. Chairman, I beg to support.

MR. IMAGA ARUNA ADAM (Arua Municipality, Arua):  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I support the Vote.  Before I give my contribution, I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Minister of Works and Transport that there is a road leading to the North, this road - the other one branches via Nakasongola town, another one is a straight one but, the repair of that road was started almost last year in December up to now, it has never been completed and Mr. Chairman, the distance of that road is about five kilometres.  Now, if a road of five kilometres takes over six months -(Interruption)- Okay, I accept the information.  

DR. LUYOMBYA:  Information.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to inform the hon. Member on the Floor that he has diverted from the Motion and he is debating -(Interruption)- he is on a general debate.

THE CHAIRMAN:  Order, Permission was granted, proceed please.

MR. IMAGA ARUNA:  Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. Member has just been on a hurry.  He would have waited until I made the conclusion.  The conclusion is that, since there is a Vote for this Ministry, I think part of this should be used to complete that road otherwise it is becoming too expensive and in the terms of fuel consumption because you take a longer route than a shorter route.  

THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF WORKS, TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. J. Nasasira):  Information.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to assure the hon. Member that part of this money is going to be spent on that road and he should expeditiously support the Motion so that we get on with the work. (Laughter)

MR. IMAGA ARUNA:  Thank you for the information. I do not know why you waited until - it took about six months.  Mr. Chairman, I would also like to say something about the Supplementary Estimates.

THE CHAIRMAN:  Hon. Adam, please concentrate on the Motion.

ME. IMAGA ARUNA:  The point I am trying to raise on the Motion is this, that most of this money was spent on allowances and traveling, therefore, the Minister of Finance should try to control expenditure on allowances.  As you all know these days salary does not make ends meet but most of the civil servants resort to making claims, no matter whether he moves or not.  I have been moving from Arua to Kampala, you find some of these people moving in the bus as if they are the crew of the bus, the reason is that anything small they want to come to Kampala so that they claim allowances and they usually select certain days in the week mainly the Fridays so that when they arrive here, offices are closed.  Sundays, Mondays, they spend it here so, if you look at this, as I said before, supplementary, the most votes which caused this supplementary expenditure is allowances and travel expenses.  So, the Minister should look at how claims are being made.

I would also like to respond to the Minister’s call for the district leaders in controlling district funds.  There is a problem.  I remember very well the Ministry of Transport gave a very good directive that the NRC Members and District Officials should meet every month to consider, to monitor how the funds for trunk roads is being used but the Chairmanship is under the D.A. who does not call for meetings.  So, we members up to now for almost six months we do not know how that money is being spent, how the roads have been maintained.  So my suggestion is that, when you are involving the district leaders you should state exactly what role they play because if the meeting is not called, we cannot go and kick the District Administrator that you should call for this meeting, so here our position should be made clear. 

Finally, the way expenditure is controlled still leaves a lot to be desired.  I think some guidelines should be stated cleared because what I see is that; the control of expenditure is not looked into very much.  The other day I suggested to the Ministry of Finance that another system should be introduced particularly in control of fuel.  But up to now, I never got any reply whether that suggestion is poor, at least, I should be informed -(Laughter)- say, that this cannot work, but if you give a suggestion and you keep quiet, I think it is not good.  Mr. Chairman, with these few words, I support the Motion.

MR. RUTARO (Rujumbura County, Rukungiri):  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, I wish to support the Motion by making one observation and this is to do with development expenditure.  During last year’s debates, most Members expressed a wish and there was sympathy from the Front Bench that is, from the Government that there should be as much as possible no projects which should be left uncompleted. After observing the figures that I see here and comparing roughly with the figures that we had last year, I do not know whether the Minister of Finance put in mind the concentration on completion of definite projects.  We all agreed as far as I remember that we can as well allocate money to certain Ministries and not others so that whatever projects there are, are completed so that another year we can also start on other projects in a different Ministry.  But the trend is that they have allocated literally to every Ministry more or less in the same way as it was last year.  

I would like the Minister to assure me that the money has not been evenly spread and that the purpose for which we deliberated will be achieved.  We have been assured by the Minister and the Government that money shall only be spent when it has been earned, yesterday we approved Supplementary Estimates, and my view is the Ministry has continued to under-budget because year in, year out, you have Supplementary Estimates and if the discipline that has been instilled in Government to spend money that has been earned is still in, then we should expect no Supplementary Estimates and I would like the Minister at the end of this Debate to assure me that certainly that has been born in mind that the budgeting has been a lot better than it was the previous years and obviously at the end of it all, we should approve what he is seeking to have in place.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

MR. NDEGE JOHN (Luuka County, Iganga):  Mr. Chairman, I welcome you back and everybody from the recess.  Mr. Chairman, in support of this Motion especially Item 50 to 62 that is the money to the district, I think now we are moving in the right direction we are putting money back to where it comes from, that is the farmer, and it is only a pity that they are only 13 out of 39 districts.  I wish to give my regret from the people of Iganga because we had a delegation led by the District Administrator that went to see the Minister of Local Government who assured us that we would be included in this Pilot Scheme.  I do not know whether you need a Pilot Scheme really to tell people to spend money or have been spending money, this is animal behaviour.  We know that all the civil servants do not want this scheme to succeed; they want the money to remain here in Kampala so that they can use it in allowances instead of sending it to the districts.  We know that there has been a deliberate delay in approving or implementing this policy, now during the debate, I am going to demand and also remind the Minister of Local Government that he left out one item that is Iganga district.  Now, the second problem that is with this - out and it will be a big wave and the Minister is going to change his mind and every district will be allocated money I am sure at the end of this debate.  

Now the other problem that we have been having is to allocate all this money under recurrent expenditure, now so many billions are being sent to the districts under recurrent expenditure.  I know we had problems when they were sending money for schools the last two or three years, you wanted o buy iron sheets they say no, you buy books because iron sheets are of a development nature.  Now we want assurance from the Minister of Local Government that if we want him to spend this money of recurrent expenditure on development expenditure he is not going to raise hell as he has been raising last two years.  

Our children are studying under trees, why should we spend money on allowances and not iron sheets and cement, we have been saying this for the last 3 or 4 years, why are you not doing what people want?  Please, for a change, do what people want; this is what you call RC system, the RC I who decide on the planning and the priorities and so on and they have been talking of for the last four years, we want iron sheets for our children so that they can go and study.  But -(Interruption)

MR. BIDANDI SSALI:  Point of information.  Mr. Chairman, on this very point, I would like to inform the hon. Member on the Floor and for the benefit of others that it would be good if some homework is first done before some statements are made here.  Because it is now over 3 months that instructions were given that the money for schools instead of being spent at the district level is sent by cheque to each individual school throughout the country, and it is up to the headmaster and the P.T.A. in collaboration with the Board of Governors of each particular school to decide on how best to use that money.  As I speak now every school should have received at least, two or more cheques, so let us talk about what is happening and what will happen not what used to happen.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. NDEGE:  I thank the hon. Minister for agreeing with my statement that it has taken us two glorious years to make him agree that this money should go to schools and not to the districts.  You see, what used to happen the money was going to the district then it comes back then they buy exercise books from Kampala then it goes back; an exercise book of 32 pages at Shs. 200/-, ridiculous!  Let the people make their own choices and this is what we are telling you that let part of this money go to the Development Budget because most of the needs are of a development nature.  They did not tell us here to spend money on allowances, they sent us here to do development, and the people of Iganga are going to be annoyed with me if we continue -(Laughter)- spending such large sums on recurrent and we leave development budget with such meagre resource.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

THE DEPUTY MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND ECONOMIC PLANNING (Mr. Kafumbe Mukasa):  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I would like to thank hon. Members for their contributions, hon. Manzi, I want to thank him for his observation but, I want to assure him that his hopes will be satisfied because he is hoping that the money to meet this Vote on Account will be raised, I can tell him that his hope is likely to be met, the money will be raised to meet the Vote on Account he feared whether that will happen. He also feared whether the monitoring unit in the Ministry of Finance would work effectively, yes, we tried to make sure that it works effectively, and also minimizing the allocations yes, we would like to minimise the allocations so that the budget implementation as far as possible follows the plan for us to have an impact.  

I explained hon. Nkalubo’s fears that it is not necessary, like hon. Ndege has said, this should be the ideal position so that if you have people down at the district who are also accountable as long as you have staff, I want to tell hon. Ndege we have not yet covered every district because of staff.  You must have accounts you post in the district, you must have this in order to hold them accountable before you appoint them your accounting officers, they must be able to handle and as this capacity is built up we shall come to all districts.  Now, hon. Nkalubo I do not know, it is not the Ministry for Finance which discriminates, Minister for Finance has no reference for one Ministry vis-a-vis another Ministry that when you come to release money to Ministry of Public Service, you favour them and the Ministry of Health you do not favour them.  It is not really the Minister for Finance, but I do not also rule out the fact that some officials in some Ministries are more efficient than others that is a fact and we try to balance or when you are posting accountants to make sure that all Ministries have equally as competent accountants as possible. 

So, it is not true that requisition for your money that has been voted, they will let you wait and someone who comes a week later is given money.  Each Ministry requisitions funds against its own vote, so discrimination is not in the Ministry of Finance.  Hon. Butagira has warned us to be very careful because empirically he has found date that because people are not drinking as much as they used to drink in the last one week; he thinks revenue may not be raised.  It is a good warning but also the Ministry wants to see whether empirically how you can work out the matter, whether you cannot raise the same amount of money but people may be in quantity-wise they may consume less alcohol, but I think consumption alone is not the only factor in consideration.  

So, we are finding out the empirical data -(Interjection)- sorry, I want to say my point, I am saying that hon. Butagira has told us his observations we cannot dismiss them.  Everyday we take the empirical date on how much revenue we raise daily from different sources and that is why you Parliamentarians are here.  If our forecast is not correct, we are not bound to go with a wrong thing. So, as hon. Butagira has warned, we are watching, and also because of the fears hon. Butagira has state, the Minister for Finance told you and asked the Chairman that in order first for us to approve expenditure and when we come to revenue measures, we cut down on the measures to raise the revenue to meet the expenditure.  The Minister is suggesting that may be; we start with a debate of the revenue measures so that if we cut down on revenue, we should appropriately put down on expenditure.  This word says so, in the past we have been starting with expenditure we approve expenditure, when hon. Members come to revenue measures, they cut down on the revenue we should get to meet the expenditure they had approved.  So, the Minister has suggested that maybe, we start by approving revenue and we fit our expenditure in the revenue you will have authorised, so that this problem does not arise.  

Secondly, I want to assure hon. Butagira that much as Government wants Mbarara University, Government has also tried to live within the resources but I want to assure him that Mbarara University now is identified on our core programme.  Core programme means that we approve development projects and now we have two sections the core and the others, meaning that the others we can do if resources become available.  The core means that they have prior claims on the available funds, so Mbarara is now a core programme and therefore, the 1.6 billion for development you have seen which has a priority has a claim on the budget in order for us to catch up on the facilitation of this University and to accommodate so many people who now qualify to go to University.  Hon. Aruna I apologise if he ever wrote to us his proposals to control budget, and he has said that even if they were not good proposals we should have replied to him to know, we shall call him to discuss his proposals and see what will happen, that one I can assure him.  

This financial year we shall discuss with him, but he also pointed out correctly that money voted for districts have mainly been consumed in allowances and so on and so forth and at the end of the day, the district does not get the benefit of the money because people are claiming for this, went to Kampala for this and so on.  Now that is why the Secretary to the Treasury says, he will appoint, as time goes, people in the district to be accounting officers so that they excuse of coming to Kampala all the time, all the way from Arua can be forgotten and more money stays in the district and I want to assure him we are very happy about his interest in controlling expenditure properly and that is why the Minister for Finance himself will receive you and you discuss these methods.  Hon. Rutaro, I have told him about the idea of core projects, that when we propose to do certain things, he is also in anticipation of what we expect to raise.  But now, we are saying despite this, there are projects we must say, we must do from resources and do them and finish them as I told hon. Butagira.  

However, I want to inform hon. Rutaro that when we come to you to seek supplementary authority is not that we are seeking you to give us power to spend money we have not earned.  Supplementary Estimate and leaving out revenue are different, we are saying even if we realise the revenue, you had not yet authorised that revenue to be spent on that activity.  So, we do not ask you to allow us Supplementary to go to get a deficit, we are saying although we raised the money, this is public money, we need your approval for the expenditure for which we used the money.  So, even if the money is available the power to spend it is yours. That is why we bring supplementary estimates to you.  I think hon. Ndege as we are doing things towards his wishes and I am glad that the Minister of Local Government has at last come to understand what hon. Ndege has been telling him for a long time.  So the Minister is good he reacts to the demands of the electorate.   So, I do not have anything to add on that one.  

Therefore, I thank everybody for the benefit of the Members who want to monitor to help Government and help the community to monitor the Vote on Account in allocating funds to the districts we are trying, the major expenditure you try to follow up is on road’s maintenance and health, and primary schools and allocation for road’s maintenance was based on the number of kilometres in the districts and the allocation for schools was based on the number of students, and the allocations for health was based on the number of hospital beds, and allocation for extension services was based on the number of extension workers in the district.  So, you must ensure that extension workers who are there do not only stay there but they must work, that is when the money can create results.  I honestly thank all Members, Mr. Chairman, and I beg to Move Sir.

Please turn to page two (2) of this document.

THE CHAIRMAN:  I now propose the question that the total sum of Shs. 4,414,847,000/- under Vote 001 - Office of the President, be provided for.

MR. WANENDEYA:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like clarification as to why the Office of the President has increased its Budget Estimates from last year’s to by nearly 62 per cent, Mr. Chairman.  I would like clarification.

MR. KAFUMBE MUKASA:  Mr. Chairman, as Members are aware, you have decided to operate under Sectoral Committees and each Minister will appear before each relevant Sectoral Committee to defend his or her Budget.  This question is relevant at the stage.  It is not true that I can know all the difficulties of all the Government Ministries.  So, I think to be fair, these are matters that you will scrutinize in detail and ask all patent Ministers to explain to you (Applause)

THE CHAIRMAN:  We approve the total?  Order please, the procedure is to vote each Ministry one by one.

MR. KANYOMOZI:  Mr. Chairman, surely it is going to be just going through the same thing all over Uganda.  Because there is not going to be any defence or any explanation given as the Minister has already said.  Do we really need to do that?

THE CHAIRMAN:  (Interruption)- I now propose the question that the total sum of Shs. 7,029,203,000 under Vote 008 - Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to).

MR. OBWANGOR:  Mr. Chairman, I would like to move a reduction of Shs. 500/- out of these Votes.  To express myself as a partner, a person of this august House which is the watch dog of the Public Finances and also to regret the delay of bringing into the eyes of this august House, the Vote on Account which is imperative, this is a release.  All the countries believe in development, because each day Parliament does not sit productively to produce its resolutions or laws for which the country must be treated in such a way that everything is flashy and working properly.  You see, a delay every time with Parliament always is causing problems, because all the policies are not put to the proper administrative areas of state.  So, that is why I am saying the Minister of Economic Development and Finance is so heavy -(Laughter)- you see, people must be getting finances because we are living in a money economy.  We are lucky; this is a very serious matter, Mr. Chairman. (Laughter)  Because the Mover of the Motion, the Minister for Finance and Economic Planning, is the Minister of Economics and a Lawyer.  Yet he should have in spirit the painfulness of seeing to it that we who knew you when we passed money during old times that productivity is talked about here in finances which occurred in this country.  Not through idleness.

THE CHAIRMAN:  Order please.  Such Motions are not provided for in our Rules of Procedures.  Therefore, we proceed.
