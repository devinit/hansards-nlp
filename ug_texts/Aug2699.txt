MOTION THAT PARLIAMENT DO RESOLVE ITSELF INTO A COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY FOR THE CONSIDERATION AND APPROVAL OF SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1998/9-(SUPPLEMENTARY SHEDULE NO.2)

COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY

VOTE 001 - OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 1,597,003,000/= under Vote 001, Office of the President, be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to).

VOTE 002 - STATE HOUSE

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 2,835,588,000/= under Vote 002 of State House be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 553,195,000/= under Vote 004 of the Office of the Prime Minister be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to)

VOTE 005 - PUBLIC SERVICE

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 1,406,263,000/=, under Vote 005 of Ministry of Public Service be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to).

VOTE 006 - FOREIGN AFFAIRS

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 1,827,750,000/= under Vote 006 of Ministry of Foreign Affairs be provided for.

MR. OKUMU RINGA: Mr. Chairman, I am seeking clarification from the Minister whether the supplementary sum being sought for approval for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was actually released. This is in light of the fact that there has been a general out cry in that Ministry, with regard to some of their basic needs, in as far as meeting of their budgetary requirements are concerned. I seek clarification, Sir.

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PRIVATISATION (Mr. Manzi Tumubweinee):  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It may be true that quite a number of times the releases for Foreign Affairs are not exactly what they should be, but in the case of this supplementary, 1,827,750,000 shillings was a refund from the Bank of Uganda to RIGS Bank. RIGS Bank had given a loan to our embassy in New York for the repair of Uganda House. So, it has nothing to do with the recurrent and general expenditure of the embassies. It was intended for the repair of the New York house.  I thank you, Mr. Chairman.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 1,827,750,000 under Vote 006 of Ministry of Foreign Affairs be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to)

VOTE 008 - MINISTRY OF FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now propose the question that a total sum of 8,199,381,000/= under Vote 008 of Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development be provided for.

MR. OKUMU RINGA: Thank you, Sir. Mr. Chairman, I am seeking clarification from the Minister. What is being requested for endorsement as supplementary for the 4 months, ending 30th June, appears not to have taken into account the directive of Government to pay all depositors of failed banks, particularly the Greenland Bank. I wonder where the Ministry of Finance got the money from, to make some of these payments, and whether or not that will now appear in the 1999/2000 financial estimate. If there was any approval, the Ministry of Finance should have paid it, and this should have come as a supplementary estimate in this second schedule. So, the 8 billion is very little, if it was to cater for payment of the failed banks. If this is not part of it, then where did Government get the money to pay the depositors of failed banks? Thank you.

MR. MANZI TUMUBWEINEEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. While the Ministry of Finance is the supervising agent for the Central bank and the financial sector, it will not directly pay for Greenland Bank, at least at present. The payment to Greenland Bank is a function of the Central Bank. The Central Bank is handling that matter on behalf of the country, because it is the overall supervisor of the whole banking sector. If the Central Bank itself gets a financial problem, and asks for recapitalisation, that is the only time we shall provide from the consolidated fund. Otherwise, the payments of the banks, which we have closed, is purely a matter of the Central Bank, of course, with input from Finance, but not financial input at present. I thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 8,199,381,000/= under Vote 008 of Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to)

VOTE 010 - MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL INDUSTRY AND FISHERIES

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 1,803,465,000/= under Vote 014 of the Ministry of Health be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to)

VOTE 015 - PARLIAMENT

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 122,310,000/= under Vote 015 of Parliament be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to)

VOTE 016 - MINISTRY OF WORKS, HOUSING AND COMMUNICATIONS

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now propose the question that a total sum of 1,453,781,000/= under Vote 016 of the Ministry of Works, Housing and communications be provided for.

MR. MUTYABA: Mr. Chairman, the achievement for Ministry of Works in the previous year was only 60 percent, as per the summary provided to our Committee, but there was a revised expenditure of that one billion, which was passed to the Ministry. If you only achieved 60 percent of the original estimate, and one billion was given to you, why did you not achieve the other 40 percent? One would have expected you to ask for 40 percent of the original estimate, but you only asked for something like 10 percent, as extra money to achieve the original objectives. And yet in the summary from the Minister he said they only achieved 60 percent of what they targeted. There is a discrepancy, which is difficult, and I would like the Prime Minister or the relevant Minister, to clarify to us how they balance that discrepancy.

MR. MANZI TUMUBWEINEEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This touches on what we talked about yesterday, in terms of supplementaries and how they come up. The fact that money has not been released does not mean that you cannot have supplementaries. As we said yesterday, supplementaries are a different brand of budgeting, because they are on a different Vote that you have not provided for.  

In the case of the Ministry of Works, Mr. Chairman, 1.1 billion was to pay for outstanding contributions to the International Civil Aviation Organisation Inter-Governmental Standing Committee on Shipping, Transport Co-ordination Authority for Northern Corridor and CMC Aviation. The balance of 353 million was to pay for monitoring the poverty action fund and domestic arrears.  So, you can see that the supplementary was for a purpose that had not been part of the main budget, and that is why it is called a supplementary. 

Mr. Chairman, may I take this opportunity, with your indulgence, to correct one small impression that was created yesterday, when I was defining technical supplementaries. Yesterday, Mr. Chairman, when I was winding up on the debate on supplementary schedule number 2, recurrent, and the Capital Funds for 1998, I was carried away and I think in the excitement, I made a statement which was not quite consistent in all aspects. 

The statement I made was in regard to technical supplementaries, which an hon. Member had raised. I included re-allocation within the same Vote, when I should not have included it. Technical supplementaries are limited to a situation where the re-allocation is between Votes; in this case, I had said from 14 to 16 or from development budget to recurrent budget. I want to apologise, because yesterday I seemed to have also implied that supplementaries include re-allocation within the same Vote.  It is not within the same Vote, it is between two Votes, and, or from development and recurrent expenditure. I thank you.

MR. WANJUSI WASIEBA: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am not satisfied with the reply of the Minister to the question, which my Colleague asked. Among the organisations were they spent money, he mentioned the Northern corridor. First of all, I want him to tell us how much they pay to the northern corridor. Two; I remember two years ago, we did agree that the Government of Uganda authorise the secretariat of the Northern Corridor to deduct this money from importers at the source in Mombasa, as the goods enter the country. Can he explain to us what happened to that arrangement before they reversed to spending this colossal amount of money?  Thank you.

MR. MANZI TUMUBWEINEEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, hon. Wanjusi Wasieba for that question. It is true that it was agreed that this money should be deducted from the source, but since that time, that decision has not been implemented.  That is why the money has been paid directly from here. We have not been able to immediately give you the exact amount, which was paid, but we can provide you with that information later on.  Thank you.  

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 1,453,781,000/= under Vote 016 of Ministry of Works, Housing and Communications be provided for.  

(Question put and agreed to).

VOTE 019 - BUTABIKA HOSPITAL.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 10,890,000/= under Vote 019 of Butabika Hospital be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to).

VOTE 021 - DEFENCE.

MR. OKUMU RINGA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Chairman, I am seeking clarification from the minister, with regard to what appears to be a general trend in technical supplementaries, were they look for soft targets, mainly Votes concerning utilities. It is either a water Vote or a telephone one and they use that as a pretext to seek for supplementaries, when in the actual Vote, in the approved Budget, such funds are provided for. Can the minister assure this House that technical supplementaries will not only refer to Votes such as utilities, where they have always been using them as means of escaping from good financial management, or to adhere to budgetary discipline? I am seeking clarification.  

MR. MANZI TUMUBWEINEEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do not think it is extremely true that the Ministry looks for soft targets in utilities. Utilities are not necessarily soft targets. Mr. Chairman, in some cases, like this case, everybody discovered that National Water and Sewerage Corporation was almost coming to a stand still because of the outstanding arrears, which were owed by very many Government ministries. So, a decision was taken. As you realise, Water alone had outstanding arrears of 12 billion, and if you remove 12 billion from one organisation, do you expect it to perform and keep pumping water? It was very important that this money be paid.  

The money was provided as a supplementary to help National Water and Sewerage Corporation to keep serving our people in towns, where they are operating. There is also a problem; they had to get some more cash flow in order for them to go to other new towns where they are going to provide water. They needed working capital.  So, it is not quite that we target them. On the question of whether I should promise that we should not target them again, I do not want to bind myself. I cannot say, we cannot, at all, in future, have technical supplementaries, because that will be a wrong promise.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 1,142,820,000/= under Vote 021 of the Ministry of Defence be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to).

VOTE 022 - MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 27,346,000/= under Vote 022 of the Ministry of Internal Affairs be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to).

VOTE 023 - MULAGO HOSPITAL COMPLEX.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 844,100,000/= under Vote 023 of Mulago Hospital Complex be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to).

VOTE 024 - MAKERERE UNIVERSITY.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 1,339,416,000/= under Vote 024 of Makerere University be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to).

VOTE 025 - MINISTRY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 202,406,000/= under Vote 025 of Ministry of Local Government be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to).

VOTE 028 - MINISTRY OF TOURISM, TRADE AND INDUSTRY.

MR. OKUMU RINGA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am seeking clarification on the Vote for Tourism in the details under Item 6050 - the document is not paged, so Members may not be able to follow. It states that this was supplementary payment required to pay allowance for the trade development office in Geneva. Mr. Chairman, indeed our representation at trade promotion levels has been very low, even in embassies, particularly in Geneva, where we have the World Trade Organisation headquarters.  So, I am seeking clarification from the Minister whether this money was only used to pay for an office facility, or whether it was used to pay for promotional expenses, because the detail given here does not reflect the proper use of the fund.  That is the clarification I am seeking.

MR. MANZI TUMUBWEINEEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I agree with him that we do not have enough trade officers in all embassies, and in all areas where we would want them. If we did, the request for further supplementaries would be enormous. There are so many other things that the one in Geneva wants - he had to pay rent, he had to pay for his water, he had to pay for his travel, so this was a combination of the requirements that he had put across. We thought it was necessary to have the trade officer there, rather than remove him, given the fact that there is a lot of work going on the negotiations in the coming implementation of WTO.  Thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 433,626,000/= under Vote 028 of Ministry of Tourism, Trade and Industry be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to).

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 5,286,253,000/= under Vote 038 of Uganda Police be provided for.

(Question put and agreed to).

VOTE 039 - UGANDA PRISONS

MR. OKUMU RINGA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When you look at the supplementary provision sought for approval, and you look at what was approved, 12,53,259,000 shillings, one would say that if all the money, which will now total to 15,558,161,000/=, was released to Uganda Prisons, the situation in the prisons would not be as pathetic as it appears today. In the footnote presented in the details, a total sum of 2,400,909,000 shillings was committed for food for prisoners. Mr. Chairman, if this money was released, it would be quite good for the general diet of the prisoners. So, is the total amount, which we are approving now, released? If it was not, or if it was, was the money used properly? Because, when you go to visit inmates, the situation is very, very bad. That is the clarification I am seeking.

MR. MWANDHA JAMES: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have heard that in some cases, if you took somebody to court, and you won the case, and that person was taken to prison, you may be called upon to pay for his food in prison. Can the minister confirm whether this is true?  Thank you.

MR. MANZI TUMUBWEINEE: Mr. Chairman, I will answer part one, and then I will leave part two to either the Minister of Constitutional Affairs or Internal Affairs. I am sure hon. Okumu Ringa now agrees with us on how the supplementaries are arrived at, if he does not, that is a different issue.  Once that one has been established, then the supplementaries are given. 

The other question is; was the money released? Yes, it was released. He also asked whether it was used properly? Now, that is for the accounting officer's accountability, for which he will answer to PAC. If he got the money which he had requisitioned for food, and you are aware that he did not use it for food but used it for something else, I think that is a different case altogether. So, as far as we are concerned, we release the money, and we are made to believe that the money was used for the purpose for which it was requisitioned. On the question of the cases, and the people looking after them, Mr. Chairman, I am not capable and competent to answer that question.  Can I ask hon. Mayanja Nkangi to answer it?

THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr. Mayanja Nkangi): Mr. Chairman, if someone dashed the hon. Member's head, God forbid. That will be a crime against the state, thus if a person is taken to prison, the state will pay for the food for that person. It is a crime against the whole country. If someone owed him some money, however, and he sought to commit this person to prison, then he would have to pay for that person.

MR. MWANDHA JAMES: I would like to appreciate the answer given by the hon. Minister, but will the hon. Minister tell the House why this is so?  Mr. Chairman, this is a very serious matter. Some people who have been wronged by others are now opting not to take them to court, because at the end of the day, you are going to be penalised by having to feed the other person when he is in prison.  So, the minister should explain whether this is a practice, because there is no money, or whether this is the practice because the person who takes the other to court should be punished. Is it a Government policy that people who take others to court and win cases should pay for those people to stay in prison? I need a more serious answer, Mr. Chairman.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Hon. Members, I think this is a matter of the law.  Let the Minister of Justice explain the legal provisions, and that will assure you. It is not really the practice, because, I think there are two different situations. One is a crime, which is a crime against the State, the State is the one revenging the wrong committed, but the other is a civil wrong as between two citizens -individuals - and how they sort themselves out is their problem.  I think it comes from them. But hon. Minister, I would like you to try and satisfy the hon. Member.

MR. MAYANJA NKANGI: Mr. Chairman, you are a distinguished lawyer, so I thought you would cover the whole thing. That is the position, it is not just a policy of Government, it is our legal system.  Crimes are complaints by someone against another, but the State takes them on because we hurt the State. This is why I say Uganda against so and so, although Uganda was not hurt or murdered. However, when you lend someone money or someone offends you, that is a private matter between you two.  So, when you use the service of the court, and it rules in your favour, and instead of trying to seek your debt from the other person, you also use the services of the State, that is by keeping this human in the prison, then the State says, this is a private matter, do not let the tax payer pay for this. If you want to send this person there, you go and see that he or she is kept there properly. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 3,504,902,000/= under Vote 039 of Uganda Prisons be provided for.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now propose the question that a total sum of 341,558,000/= under Vote 074 of Nebbi District be provided for.

MR. OKUMU RINGA: Thank you, Sir. Mr. Chairman, I would like, first of all, to thank the Minister because teachers in Nebbi are now getting their salaries, even though they sometimes get them late. Whereas the Ministry is trying its best to allocate money for UPE, and it is also paying teachers, there is a big gap between the time the money is released and the time the money is received. Is there a way in which this period can be reduced, so that teachers are able to receive their money at least not beyond midway in the month?  Otherwise, I would like to thank the Ministry for ensuring that the backlog of teacher's pay has been reduced.  I thank you.

MR. MANZI TUMUBWEINEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That is a good suggestion. The Ministry is going to look into it, to see why the money is not arriving at the right time, and within a short time.  If he has ideas about how we can hasten the delivery of this money, we welcome the ideas.  I thank you.

HEAD 104 - OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now propose the question that a total sum of 1,958,959,000/= under Head 104, Office of the Prime Minister, be provided for.

MR. OKUMU RINGA: Thank you, Sir. Mr. Chairman, I am seeking clarification with regard to the supplementary proposal we are supposed to approve.  It is 1,958,959,000/-, and the foot note here states, "that additional funds sought to pay taxes on resealing of Kafu-Karuma road." This is the footnote.  Could the Minister explain how payment of taxes on the resealing of Kafu-Karuma road arose?  It is in the footnote.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Which page is it?

MR. OKUMU RINGA: It is page 28.  Mr. Chairman, that is the very document you are referring to. Could the Minister explain why the Ministry of Finance would pay, under NURP fund, 1,958,959,000 shillings, almost 2 billion shillings, in form of taxes? I am just seeking clarification. Are they taxes for a job done or taxes on goods procured; what kind of taxes are they?  I thank you.

MR. MANZI TUMUBWEINEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Clearly, hon. Okumu Ringa if you look under code MSO 1H, the programme was Northern Uganda Rehabilitation Programme feeder roads, and the activity is 411, which is taxes. For every activity you do, you pay taxes. Contractors also pay taxes; they pay VAT. There are two ways of doing this, you can give a contract and charge taxes, and the contractor pays the taxes, but of course, will invoice you for the taxes. Alternatively, you can agree on the taxes, pay him net, and then pay the taxes to Revenue Authority.  

You are aware that in the last Budget we approved 52 billion for tax element on Government services, and this money was held under Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. So, when the work was done, the NAZARO Uganda Programme applied for the tax element, which was transferred from Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to the Office of the Prime Minister for purposes of paying taxes. So, this is the technical supplementary, because we are moving from programme 008 and transferring the money to programme 108 - Development.  Thank you.

MR. OKUMU RINGA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The explanation given by the Minister could be very misleading for somebody just reading this text, because this could imply that the Ministry is the one paying the taxes, whereas here, you are paying on behalf of the contractor.  This means it should actually be a book entry in your system. So, Mr. Chairman, the way it is presented would be very misleading, but if that is the way the Minister of Finance presents it, we cannot change it just by one simple statement.  I thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: I now put the question that a total sum of 1,958,959,000/= under Head 104 of the Office of the Prime Minister be provided for.

MOTION FOR THE HOUSE TO RESUME

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PRIVATISATION (Mr. Manzi Tumubweinee) Mr. Chairman, I beg to move that the House do resume and the Committee of Supply do report thereto.  I beg to move.

(Question put and agreed to)

REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PRIVATISATION (Mr. Manzi Tumubweinee) Mr. Speaker, I beg to report that the Committee of Supply has considered and approved the supplementary estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 1999/2000, without any amendments.  Mr. Speaker, I beg to move.

MOTION FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PRIVATISATION (Mr. Manzi Tumubweinee) Mr. Speaker, I beg to move that the report from the Committee of Supply be adopted.

(Question put and agreed to)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: So, the report has been adopted, that means we have approved the supplementaries.

This is just to remind you, hon. Members, that on Monday, at 4.00p.m, hon. Members of Parliament will have an opportunity to interact with His Excellency the President on matters relating to security. I think a circular from the office of the Clerk has already informed you about that.  This is merely a reminder. 

You are also aware that the Committees are working very hard to examine ministerial statements, which have been submitted by various Ministries. I am told they are doing their best, but notwithstanding that, we do not have enough time for the committees to discharge that work and to start working on their regular programme. For that reason, we are going to provide space for the Committees to accomplish that work, particularly the work relating to the Budget or the reports from the ministries. So, I will adjourn the Plenary for sometime in order to provide that space for the committees to work. So, the Plenary will be adjourned to Tuesday 7th September 1999.  The House is accordingly adjourned.  

(The House rose and adjourned until Tuesday, 7th September, 1999 at 2.00 p.m.)
