PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES(HANSARD)OFFICIAL REPORTTHIRD SESSION - THIRD MEETINGTHURSDAY , 28 MARCH 2024PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA12201Thursday, 28 March 2024I have previously emphasised the need for climate mitigation through tree planting, responsible environment and natural resource use, among others. Today, I reiterate my call to champion the conservation of the environment. I ask Members, where you can, to please plant trees to avoid what is happening today to happen in the future. The rains have returned, and I know that trees will grow. Let us be the champions of afforestation. As we go to our constituencies, please, let us do a campaign on tree planting. Honourable members, the Pan-African Parliament re-elected Chief Fortune Charumbira as the President. He had been removed when he went for elections in Zimbabwe. However, on Monday, there were elections and he was re-elected as the President. Join me in congratulating the Pan-African Parliament and wishing them the best in their legislation. At least the Pan-African Parliament is back on the ground now. Honourable members, today the House will receive the Budget estimates for the Financial Year 2024/2025 and attendant budget-related documents. This will mark the start of the intense Budget approval process. As per Article 155 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda and Section 14 of the Public Finance Management Act, I, therefore, wish to guide as follows: IN THE PARLIAMENT OF UGANDAOfficial Report of the Proceedings of ParliamentTHIRD SESSION - 18TH SITTING - THIRD MEETING Parliament met at 9.59 a.m. in Parliament House, Kampala.PRAYERS(The Speaker, Ms Anita Among, in the Chair.)The House was called to order.COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRTHE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you to this morning’s sitting. I received a letter from the Katikkiro  of Buganda, inviting Parliament to the annual Kabaka Birthday Run, slated for 7 April 2024. The run is meant to collect money for the intervention of HIV/AIDS. I invite the honourable members to support the Kingdom. Let us go and see how we can support them. We will lead the team to go there on Tuesday. As Parliament, we need to support this because the cause is good. The Government Chief Whip is effectively informed. Get ready to lead your team to go and support the Kingdom. Plus, all the commissioners. Please, let us do that.Honourable members, the country is witnessing environmental and climatic changes, which have been occasioned by, among others, the increased deforestation, swamps that have been cleared, pollution, and general environmental degradation. 12202COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR [The Speaker]1.  The sectoral committees will commence reporting the ministerial policy statements on Tuesday, 2 April in the House and the statutory deadline is 20 April. This means that everything will have been completed by 20 April; 2.  Upon consideration of the reports of the sectoral committees on the ministerial policy statements, the Budget Committee will be required to reconcile the ministerial statements with the Budget, which is going to be laid today, harmonise it, consolidate the Budget estimates contained in the reports of the sectoral committees and report back to this House, not later than 10 May. The Budget should be ready by 10 May. The House will supply the Budget for the Financial Year 2024/2025 and consider the appropriation on the 16th of May. I hope the finance ministry and the Government Chief Whip are on board. Honourable members, I received a letter dated 15 March 2024, from the Minister of Public Service, Hon. Wilson Muruli Mukasa, requesting to withdraw two Bills, which were part of the rationalisation process. That is the Constitutional (Amendment) Bill, 2023 and the National Tribunal Bill, 2023. This letter serves as a notice of intention to withdraw the Bills as stipulated under Rule 140(1) of the Rules of Procedure. In furtherance to Rule 140(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I will invite the minister to move a motion to withdraw the Bills immediately after this communication. Honourable members, as you may be aware, Section 8 of the Public Finance Management Act requires the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, as part of the objectives of achieving the Charter of Fiscal Responsibility, to Table in Parliament, the tax and revenue Bills, which give Government power to obtain money to finance the Budget. The Bills are supposed to be introduced for the first reading today, pursuant to Section 13(1)(a) of the Public Finance Management Act. The minister will be introducing the Bills, and remember, it is out of those Bills that we are going to get money to fund the Budget. I will, therefore, vary the Order Paper to accommodate the tabling of the tax Bills for the first reading. Honourable members, as part of the holy week celebrations, the Parliamentary Anglican Chaplaincy has organised Easter Carols this evening at 4.00 p.m. in the Conference Hall. You are all most welcome to join us for the Easter Carols. I thank you all for coming.MR BYANYIMA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker – THE SPEAKER: There is a procedural matter. Are you also on procedure? MR BYANYIMA: Yes, please. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am sorry to come in at this particular time, but based on the years I have spent here, I have a problem. As a country, we have been blessed by brilliant people. The post of Permanent Secretary/Secretary to the Treasury (PS/ST) has always been occupied by very high-level people. I can tell you that the late Robert Ekinu was once there. Do you remember the former Governor, Bank of Uganda - people like Kassami, Muhakanizi  and Ggoobi now? When the PS/ST goes to a committee of Parliament and says that we have no role to play in the budget and appropriation, it defeats my understanding. Has this country changed? Because Article 155 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda gives us all the powers. A few minutes ago, you were enumerating the roles we are supposed to play. Members of Parliament have to –THE SPEAKER: Can we first have the lights on? Why are they switching them off when you are talking about appropriation? (Laughter) Can we have the lights on?12203THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA THURSDAY , 28 MARCH 2024MR BYANYIMA: Madam Speaker, I can assure you that Members have been very keen year in, and year out, to attend sectoral committees to consider the Budget though not all that we approve in the Budget does not come to reality. However, when the PS/ST says that we have no role in appropriation, I do not see why we are wasting our time going into the Budget; it does not make sense. (Applause)  This Government is anchored on three pillars; Parliament, Executive and Judiciary. We should respect each other.Every year, whenever we say, “Do not spend money on this,” it will still be spent on the 3 per cent. It has even gone very far; I have seen a paper where he said that the parliamentary budget will be cut by 50 per cent. Where does such a person get powers from? I am happy the minister is here. I respect you, but there is a rule that we must respect each other. Treat other people the way you want to be treated. We have been demeaned to nothing. I was in the Sixth, and Seventh parliaments - even the Budget Act was a Private Member’s Bill – (Interruption)  MR SSEWUNGU: Thank you, honourable member and senior. Madam Speaker, the issue of the PS/ST must be handled very seriously. In the Committee of Education and Sports, we summoned this man and he refused to appear. The Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development rang him when we were together, but he still refused.Recently, the Committee on Public Accounts (Central Government), chaired by Hon. Muwanga Kivumbi invited him, but he refused. He does not respect Members of Parliament and the committees of Parliament; I want this to be put on record. Yet, he is the issuing officer of any funds of Government. Madam Speaker, you and I were members of the Committee on Public Accounts for some time, but you will remember that we would invite the late Muhakanizi and he would appear at any time Parliament would invite him to a committee. However, I do not know where Mr Ramathan Ggoobi gets his powers from. Once you remove appropriation from Parliament, then what are we doing here? We are rendered null and void and thus not useful. Madam Speaker, under your wise leadership, we need to take a firm position on the PS/ST. Otherwise, he does not respect Parliament. Thank you. MR BYANYIMA: Thank you, honourable colleague. In short, I do not know how we can handle it. I think we need a sincere apology to this House. We cannot continue coming here, but being demeaned. Members are running like headless chickens, going to committees here and there, to appropriate and even see what can come to their constituencies then you want to take over our powers? I am constrained. Thank you.THE SPEAKER: Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, is there some sabotage? Honourable members, the issue that Hon. Nathan is raising is very important. I refer you to Article 156 of the Constitution regarding the Appropriation Bill and Section 14 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015, which is on the approval of the annual budget by Parliament. If Parliament did not have any role in this process, then everything would be done from wherever it is done and we get information like any other person. The Parliament of Uganda has four roles: 1. Appropriation, most importantly; 2. Oversight; 3. Representation; and 4. Legislation. Therefore, if anybody wants to take over the powers of Parliament, we got these powers here and we must leave them here. No technical person should come and take over the powers of this Parliament. Can we hear from the committee chairperson who was told off?12204COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR10.21MR MUHAMMAD MUWANGA KIVUMBI (NUP, Butambala County, Butambala): Thank you, Madam Speaker. This issue arose during an interaction when we were interrogating the Government’s handling of consolidated accounts. Let me give Parliament some facts. As the Committee on Public Accounts (Central Government), we noted that consistently, the Government has been coming here with budgets of Shs 54 trillion, Shs 52 trillion and Shs 48 trillion. We made a trend analysis for the last five years of the actual expenditure of the Government, matching revenue and expenditure, and it has never exceeded Shs 45 trillion. We then asked the PS/ST what the essence was of him consistently coming during a budget process and presenting to a country a rosy picture of Shs 53 trillion, Shs 52 trillion and Shs 51 trillion, well-knowing that never in any single year, since the history of this country, has he ever spent above Shs 45 trillion. The understanding is that they balloon the budget to Shs 52 trillion and give a yield of 3 per cent. They do a secondary appropriation of their own on day one, 1st July of the financial year thereby disregarding the budget process. They go to the extent of spending – THE SPEAKER: Committee chairperson, you are raising a very important issue. First of all, we need to understand: do we have the powers? First, leave that point. We want to first understand from the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development; what is the use of you bringing your budget here when we have no powers? As a Member of Parliament, is that how you are going to allow this institution to continue being humiliated? Can we say that we should not receive the budget because we do not have the power?  MR MUWANGA KIVUMBI: And where the minister made the statement that we do not have the powers. Later, he accused Parliament and lawmakers saying, “The difference between the Budget Framework Paper and the actual budget is always a distortion of decision makers. That is when he said, “You do not even enjoy those powers to do what you are doing.”THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Byanyima, have you finished? You were still speaking. MR BYANYIMA: I was saying that it is not only during this financial year, but rather every financial Year. In the past, Parliaments were in charge and I want us to be in charge of doing the things we are entitled to do. For example, a committee inviting the Permanent Secretary and Secretary to the Treasury (PS/ST) and he does not come - you know what that means? I feel that we need a serious apology so that from today, we know that each department of the Government has its duty and that one cannot usurp other people’s powers.10.22MS SARAH OPENDI (NRM, Woman Representative, Tororo):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. This morning, I was listening to the PS/ST on Nile Broadcasting Services Television (NBS) and they were discussing this matter. He said that Parliament has no power of budgeting; and that it is an Executive function. He also said that Parliament has no power to move money from one V ote to another because budgeting for this country is not our responsibility, but rather the Executive’s responsibility. He added that it is the Executive that knows the priorities of this country. So, what is our role, as Parliament? I thought that ours is to scrutinise this budget and as the people’s representative, move money to where we feel the focus should be. If we see money being placed in areas that are not a priority – if for example, we need roads, and then we find money being placed in other things like “mchaka-mchaka”  mind-set  change when we have no roads to use, when people have no water - as people’s representatives, what should our role be in this budgeting process? It is like the PS/ST is saying that we are here to rubber-stamp. 12205THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA THURSDAY , 28 MARCH 2024In conclusion, he said that we can only recommend, but we should not touch the budget once it is presented. That is what he was referring to. Madam Speaker, that was the information that I wanted to give Hon. Byanyima.The challenge we have in this country is picking people who have not grown into public service and placing them into such sensitive positions. Previously, a PS/ST used to rise through the ranks, up to undersecretary until he became a PS/ST. When you pick somebody from somewhere, they do not respect leaders and people. Thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, there is a difference between formulation, consideration and approval. When you look at Article 155, the Financial Year estimates, (1) says: “ The President shall cause to be prepared and laid before Parliament in each financial year, but in any case not later than the fifteenth day before the commencement of the financial year, estimates of revenues and expenditure of the Government for the next financial year .”When you look at 155(4), it says: “ At any time before Parliament considers the estimates of revenue and expenditure laid before it or on the authority of the President, an appropriate Committee may discuss and review the estimates and make appropriate recommendations to Parliament” . Yours is to formulate, give reviews, make changes to Parliament and approve. 10.24THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Norbert Mao):  Madam Speaker, I agree with the Members who have raised these matters. I do not know the exact words the PS/ST used and where he said those words, but let me -THE SPEAKER:  Honourable Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, can we first hear from the Minister of Finance? I do not want you to carry a burden, which is not yours. 10.24THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. To the best of my knowledge and experience -THE SPEAKER:  As a Member of Parliament and Chairperson of the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development and now a minister.                                                                                  MR MUSASIZI:  As a Member of Parliament who worked in the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development for 10 years, Budget Committee and all other related committees, to the best of my knowledge, appropriation powers rest with Parliament -THE SPEAKER:  That is why you are a very good minister.MR MUSASIZI:  And if the PS/ST expressed his views and opinion, I am not privy to what he said and I know that he does not have a chance to speak on this microphone; I invite colleagues to disregard what the PS/ST said. We should always take what we say as the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. If whatever he said and wherever he said it offended a committee of Parliament or Parliament in general, I would like to apologise on his behalf. (Applause)THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. Even as you apologise, please pass the message to him and say that what he said was not correct. Can I have the commitment from the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs that we will always protect the Constitution, uphold it and not bring here personal feelings?10.27THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Norbert Mao):  Madam Speaker, some people have expressed contemptuous opinions of this House, historically. I was in this Parliament when the late Governor, having been summoned 12206COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR [Mr Mao]to talk about fiscal policy, said he had no time to talk about fiscal policy and monetary matters with potato growers.  This seems to be our society. However, laws are non-negotiable and fortunately, they are written. There is something we call contempt of Parliament. You have seen how the Judiciary has been very tough on those who have acted contemptuously of the institution of the Judiciary. Others have even been sent to jail. You, honourable colleagues, have, on occasion, sent some people to the basement for misbehaving and abusing the privileges of Parliament. It is not that the contempt is against you, individually, but against the people of Uganda because this is the only institution, which represents everybody. This is the People’s House. So, it is up to you, Madam Speaker, to draw a red line, which nobody should cross without consequences and it will be within the law. Thank you. THE SPEAKER: Thank you. (Members rose_)  Let us resolve this issue of the Budget; I am here for the Budget first. Government Chief Whip, regarding our deduction of 50 per cent, shall we be paid salary? Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, you even have the courtesy to put it in bold – on a statutory V ote – that Parliament should not get money.Can I hear from the Government Chief Whip? We need a commitment that you will always protect the institution of Parliament.10.29THE GOVERNMENT CHIEF WHIP (Mr Hamson Obua): Madam Speaker, in addition to laws being non-negotiable, they are interpreted as they are. I have addressed my mind to the provision of Chapter 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, as amended, which is on finance. When you look at Article 152, on taxation, Parliament has a responsibility. Under Article 153, on the Consolidated Fund, Parliament has a responsibility. Under Article 154, on the withdrawal from the Consolidated Fund, Parliament has a responsibility. Under Article 155, on the financial year estimates, Parliament has a responsibility. Under Article 156, on the Appropriation Bill, Parliament has a mandate. Under Article 157, on the Contingencies Fund, Parliament has a mandate.Madam Speaker, I may have nothing useful to add, but simply to state that the laws made must be interpreted as they are. The Constitution and the Public Finance Management Act should be read together with the Rules of Procedure of Parliament. On the question of the Budget, I believe that all of us, even as ministers, are primarily paid as Members of Parliament – in principle. Therefore, we have an obligation. Under the same Constitution, you cannot vary what one has been receiving to his or her disadvantage. That becomes unconstitutional, under the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda. I beg to submit.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you so much. Hon. Kivumbi, had you concluded?MR SSEWUNGU: Madam Speaker, on the issue of the Permanent Secretary/Secretary to Treasury, the minister who has just stepped out was talking casually, saying he was not aware of what happened and where it was said, but a Member was in the committee of Parliament and the chairperson of the committee is here. Madam Speaker, under our rules, there is a procedure we use to bring those people here to make a public apology to Parliament. That is why we have those two bars there. The business of this gentleman is growing day by day. I know what happened between him and Hon. Muyingo in the Committee on Education and Sports on the same issue. So, I do not agree.I beseech you, Madam Speaker, that this “big man”, who is the PS/ST, should appear before Members of Parliament, we pull out the bars and he apologizes to this House. Otherwise, ministers – You heard my former 12207THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA THURSDAY , 28 MARCH 2024president, Hon. Norbert Mao, giving reference to the Sixth Parliament, but we are in the 11th Parliament and with different Members who were not there then. Regarding this business of belittling Members of Parliament by a person, I beg to move a motion that the PS/ST should appear before Parliament in person and apologise, as the honourable member requested. Members, I request you to support me. (Laughter)THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, it is good that the responsible minister has given an apology on his behalf – and this should be the first and last time. I am also going to write to the PS/ST and tell him to respect the committees of Parliament.Honourable chairpersons of committees make use of rule 208 - the special powers of a committee. By the time we come in, you will have taken action. We would not be discussing this if you had taken action. Use your powers. Yes, Commissioner?10.34MR MATHIAS MPUUGA (NUP, Nyendo-Mukungwe Division, Masaka City): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I listened to the honourable Chairperson of the Committee on Public Accounts (Central Government) and I think that, along the way, we lost a key point that he was raising because he was asked to wait on his submission. Now that we are receiving the final budget figures today, he alluded to the fact that we receive Budget figures that have no relationship with what we finally spend. He made a very critical allusion to the three per cent and how it is abused because three per cent of Shs 57 trillion is not the same as three per cent of Shs 45 trillion – THE SPEAKER: Hon. Musasizi, I hope you are getting what he is saying. MR MPUUGA:  I do not know whether the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development can respond or probably the Speaker could ask Hon. Kivumbi to resubmit on that critical matter because it is very serious. It touches on the probity of the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and how it can easily mislead Ugandans into what they are dealing with. If they lay a budget of Shs 51 trillion, yet in actual sense, we have never even utilised Shs 50 trillion, but again, they utilise three per cent of Shs 51 trillion, there is a problem. In the same breath, we probably need to get an update, as Parliament, on what became of the amendment Bill to the Public Finance Management Act which was intended, again, to address some of these very critical matters, including the abuse of the three per cent.Madam Speaker, with your indulgence, you could allow Hon. Kivumbi to make that point with further clarity so that the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development can respond to Parliament on that matter. I beg.THE SPEAKER: Thank you. Finance? (Mr Musasizi rose_)  Hon. Kivumbi could clarify. [Mr Musasizi: “Let me give information.”] Hon. Musasizi, this is very good for you. You need to get what the Members feel. MR MUWANGA KIVUMBI: Madam Speaker, as I earlier explained, we are in the Budget process. We have made a trend analysis of the performance of actual revenue and expenditure over the last five years and we reveal that the Budget has never performed beyond Shs 45 trillion. Therefore, in economic modelling, of which they are experts, it is imprudent of any agency, for specific planning, to come up consistently with a figure that is over and above the traditional performing levels. Therefore, when they come to Parliament with a budget, now of Shs 54 trillion or Shs 52 trillion, when they are sure they will never raise revenue and perform beyond Shs 45 trillion, what is the essence of engaging Parliament in a very elaborate process of budgeting for Shs 54 trillion when they are sure they will raise around Shs 45 trillion from borrowed money and revenue collection? 12208COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR [Mr Kivumbi]The whole essence of it is that they will apply the three per cent on an artificial figure, which three per cent will give them around Shs 1.5 trillion, which, immediately, after passing our Budget, they will sit in another review meeting – they call it repurposing or suppressing. That is where they suppress those budgets we are talking about and yield 1.5 - They take on the powers of Parliament to appropriate, including items that we have rejected traditionally. Therefore, as we embark on the Budget process, I intend to bring here a statement on the Consolidated Account and Treasury Operations before we make the reports. THE SPEAKER: Actually, you need to unpack V ote 130. MR MUWANGA KIVUMBI: Yes, I have already, and the report is nearly ready. By next week, we can present that report. Since we have been budgeting without real impact, what is critical now is that this big statement here has an artificial figure which the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development knows and will never raise other than raising the 3 per cent. Why do you consistently take Parliament and the country to a very rosy garden where you are sure you will never fulfil? That is the issue, Madam Speaker.THE SPEAKER:  There is information from Hon. Dickson Kateshumbwa. MR KATESHUMBWA: Madam Speaker, to resolve this matter, we need to fast-track the amendment of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA). While we are going to listen to the budget estimates today -THE SPEAKER: Just a minute, let us find out what happened. 10.36MR MUWANGA KIVUMBI (NUP, Butambala County, Butambala): Madam Speaker, this morning, I met a committee headed by our legal team on the PFMA. The 60 days have passed, but the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development has responded to the usual letter of financial implication. In the letter that they have written to the Clerk to Parliament and copied to you, Madam Speaker and I, they have failed to give a Certificate of Financial Implication. Nonetheless, I am ready, even on Tuesday, to bring this amendment for the first reading. THE SPEAKER: Did they write back after 60 days? MR MUWANGA KIVUMBI: They wrote a letter saying that the amendment has a financial implication on the Contingency Fund. They even wrote to the Solicitor-General although he tasked them to unpack and give the detail of the financial implications, which they did not do. As of now, the letter they wrote to us is immaterial and the days have passed. We can now move, as Parliament, and consider that amendment.THE SPEAKER: Okay , Hon. Kateshumbwa. MR KATESHUMBWA:  Madam Speaker, the budget is a function of income and expenditure. The estimates we are going to receive today are assuming and projecting the expected income, including the source of revenue. One of the sources, as we know, is from the tax measures that the minister is going to table at the same time. Along the way, as we consider the tax Bills, this House has always looked at them and some have been struck down, but when they are struck down, the estimates that would have been estimated from those measures are never revised from the Budget. Therefore, this calls into question the way we synchronise this budgeting process. This is why I think that the amendment of the PFMA will help us try and tie the loose ends because if the tax Bills are estimated to generate, say, Shs 1 trillion, and half of them are struck down by this House yet you have already confirmed the figures of the Budget and there 12209THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA THURSDAY , 28 MARCH 2024is no mechanism for the ministry to go back and revise the Budget, it leaves us with that gap that is not closed. I think the House needs to consider the amendments to the PFMA as quickly as possible so that we tie these loose ends and make sure that the process we are undertaking is credible and meaningful. I beg to submit. THE SPEAKER: Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, we need a Certificate of Financial Implication on that and if you cannot provide it, then we will proceed. If you are saying it has a financial implication, to what extent? 10.44THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi): Thank you, Madam Speaker. About the amendment of the Public Finance Management Act, I suggest that we harmonise.   We are also beginning to consider various amendments in the same Act. Led by Hon. Kivumbi, our honourable colleague here, we think that there are areas where we need to make changes. I would like to humbly appeal to this House to initiate the process of harmonisation so that we come back here when we are together. THE SPEAKER: Honourable minister, you may not even need to harmonise. I note that you also want an amendment to the Public Finance Management Act and if it is in good faith, you can even take over the Bill, as Government, since you are claiming that it affects Article 93. MR MUSASIZI: Madam Speaker, I agree with you. However, I believe in first things first. Considering the season, we are in, can I beg that we deal with the Budget and then in July, we can - THE SPEAKER: I like the way you have taken over the House as a Speaker, but what Hon. Muwanga Kivumbi is saying is very important. We need to sit down and see how we work on the Public Finance Management Act. Honourable members, in the public gallery this morning, we have students and teachers of Serenity High School from Wakiso District represented by Hon. Hannington Wakayima - Hon. Wakayima, where are you? That is a very good boy and a very good Member of Parliament; please bring him back - and Hon. Ethel Naluyima Mugole . She is the best and a very good lady. Please bring her back to Parliament. Join me in welcoming them on behalf of the two Members of Parliament. (Applause)10.47THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Mr Joel Ssenyonyi): Thank you, Madam Speaker. First, I appreciate the call to honourable colleagues to participate in Kabaka’s Birthday run. I did go with a couple of Members yesterday, together with other leaders, to purchase the birthday kits. I want to join you in rallying Members and I am glad you requested the Government Chief Whip and Hon. Norbert Mao here, who is a “Musajja wa Kabaka”  in one way or another, to rally honourable colleagues. I encourage honourable colleagues to purchase the kits and be part of the run whose theme is a critical one this year. They are encouraging the men, especially, to step up in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Away from that, two critical issues -THE SPEAKER: The Chairperson of the Buganda Parliamentary Caucus says that they have bought kits for all Members of Parliament. We are not going as buyers; we are going to support the cause as sponsors. We want to go as Parliament and as sponsors, not to buy kits. We thank you for buying for us. I am still waiting for mine to be delivered. 10.47THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Mr Joel Ssenyonyi): Thank you, Madam Speaker. That is a very welcome cause, as we are saying. 12210COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR [Mr Ssenyonyi]Two critical issues - On February 29th, we were here in Parliament and Kampala City Council Authority (KCCA) casual labourers were protesting outside because their salaries and NSSF had not been paid for up to six months. You met them and promised to meet KCCA leaders. That meeting happened and the KCCA leadership committed to pay all the arrears by 6th March. These casual labourers were protesting again, this time round at the KCCA offices yesterday, because today is the 28th and this money has not been paid yet. These casual labourers have families and children for whom to pay school fees. I do not know why we are not prioritising this issue. The Government seems to be telling lies because, in that meeting, which you chaired, they committed that on the 6th of March, they would pay all the arrears, but this has not happened yet. I think it would be important for this House to get feedback because we get calls from these casual labourers saying, “Please help us, we are struggling, our children are being sent away from school over little money.” We do not know why the Government is refusing to take care of this issue. Hopefully, they will respond. The second and last issue is regarding the ministerial policy statements. Firstly, rule 149, as you did allude, provides for the deadline within which the committees can process the policy statements; that is April 20th. Today, you have called us to lay the alternative ministerial policy statements which we are ready to do. We understand that some committees are already signing reports. Members have been called and they are signing reports. The challenge with that then is the alternatives do not get to be captured because if you are signing already, then what is the essence of the alternative ministerial policy statements? The essence was they get to be sent to the sectoral committees, they are processed as well, and value gets to be added to the ministerial policy statements, but that does not seem to be the case, yet we have got a bit of time for that to happen. Relatedly, when some ministries were laying the ministerial policy statements, they only laid for some entities and not all. For example, the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, which we have been talking about extensively this morning, did not lay for all the entities under them, yet their deadline already passed. We do not know what their plan is. Maybe they will share with us. But also, some ministerial policy statements were laid without estimates and it is coming through in the various committees. Some ministries have been sent away by these committees so I think it would be good that we get some kind of guidance on how we deal with these issues so that the committees are not struggling on their end, yet there are critical issues to be dealt with. Thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. To the best of my knowledge, finance laid all the ministerial policy statements here. When you look at rule 147, the Alternative Policy Statements, “The Shadow Ministers may submit the alternative policy statements to Parliament by the 29th day of March every year” and you have them, you are ready to submit. The essence of us sending these documents to the sectoral committees is for them to do scrutiny. When they scrutinise and harmonise, they will be able to interact with those institutions. Where there is a need for a correction, they will do it there. Regarding the issue of others writing reports while others are ready - I have realised some committees are ready. That is why on Tuesday, we shall start receiving them and then send them to the Budget Committee for harmonisation. Regarding the issue of KCCA, the money paid to these people is little money. If these people are demonstrating, I do not think that these people have sticks, they just walk. The other day, they walked up to the gate. I addressed them and agreed on a way forward. I called the Executive Director (ED), and said she had 12211THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA THURSDAY , 28 MARCH 2024started making payments. Yesterday, I had a meeting with the Permanent Secretary and Secretary to Treasury (PS/ST), Hon. Musasizi, and Hon. Kasaija, the Minister for Finance. He said they released the final money yesterday. Is that true? 10.54THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi):  Madam Speaker, it is true that all the money required has been released to KCCA and I am sure KCCA will make the payment plan and pay all the beneficiaries. THE SPEAKER:  Honourable Minister of Constitutional Affairs, much as these people were demonstrating, they were just walking, asking for their money. Did they need to tear gas and beat people like some were beaten? There is a picture that was moving around of how somebody was brutally handled. Was that required? Please. 10.55THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Norbert Mao):  Madam Speaker, this is a human rights issue and today, we are on the Order Paper to lay on the Table our action-taken report. It is illegal to use that kind of force. First and foremost, from my observation of the duration that I have spent in that office, I found that the absence of regulations to the Public Order Management Act gives the police too much discretion. We are in the final stages of enacting those regulations so that the discretion is reduced and the police do not violate the Constitution. Right now, they only use the mother Act and they think they have the right to give permission or to deny it. The truth of the matter is; that they can only regulate. They can tell demonstrators, this is the time you can demonstrate, this is where you can demonstrate, and this is how we shall offer you protection. So, the solution lies in the regulations and we are in the final stages of bringing those regulations. THE SPEAKER:  Honourable minister, kindly advise your people that you cannot - Do you know how much those people suffer? They clean the streets, they are knocked on early in the morning, they have children, they are not protected and when they come to claim their Shs 150,000, they are beaten and tear gas is applied to them. I think we need to be fair to these people. The people you are beating, the women you are beating, are your mothers, your wives, your sisters. At the end of the day, we will not have voters. Those are our mothers. The other day they came and met us here in Parliament. We did not have any guns and we were safe with those people. You do not need to treat those people like that and KCCA must pay these people. This business of saying it is only one company that should work - There was a letter saying, bonna bakole  (let all of them work). Where will they get jobs if you allow only one group? Next - I am here for a specific reason with a statutory deadline. MOTION TO WITHDRAW BILLSTHE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, as you heard before, the Minister of Public Service, Hon. Muruli Mukasa, wrote a letter to me seeking the withdrawal of the two Bills - I do not see the minister here. 10.58THE GOVERNMENT CHIEF WHIP  (Mr Hamson Obua):  Madam Speaker, I have spoken to the Minister of Public Service, Hon. Muruli Mukasa, and he said that he is unwell at the moment. He stated that even though he had given notice to withdraw two Bills; the Constitutional (Amendment) Bill and the National Tribunal Bill, there are still consultations going on with the Principal Legal Advisor of Government, the Attorney-General. That will also culminate in consulting the Cabinet then he will come and give the 12212COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR LAYING OF PAPERSfinal position, on whether the Bills will be withdrawn or not. In the circumstances, I pray that we defer this subject. Thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, what was the use of writing to the Speaker? 10.59MR FOX ODOI-OYWELOWO  (NRM, West Budama North East County, Tororo):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. We have rules that govern the processes of this House. Once a Bill is read for the first time and committed to the committee, we have 45 days within which to handle it and report back to the House. We are now in a situation where the Executive says, “We have withdrawn a Bill,” and “We have not withdrawn a Bill. There are consultations still ongoing.” What do we do with our internal processes? I did not want to use the un-parliamentary word “shabby,” but I cannot find any other polite word to describe this particular action. It is shabby and shameful and I think the Executive owes us an apology. Thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you.MR OBUA:  Madam Speaker, notice in my humble opinion is different from a withdrawal. Hon. Fox Odoi is asking: “What should the internal processes be?” Committees, kindly proceed with the Bills before you –THE SPEAKER:  No! Government Chief Whip, I do act for and on behalf of this House. When the letter is written to me, it is written to this House. When it is written to the House, that formed the basis of us putting it on the Order Paper. I know you as a very organised person. Do not allow somebody’s being shabby to spoil you. There is no other word that you can use. Maybe, the Deputy Attorney-General needs to advise us on this. 11.02THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY-GENERAL  (Mr Jackson Kafuuzi):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. It is indeed an interesting situation. My boss, the Government Chief Whip, has made his point clear. The Minister of Public Service, the principal mover, decided to write to the Speaker. As the Government Chief Whip has said, there are ongoing consultations. What happens in the circumstances is that the Speaker, being the custodian of the Rules of Procedure of this House, can make a decision based on what she has in her possession. She has both the Bills and the letter communicating the intention to withdraw. If –(Interjection) – please, let me speak. Madam Speaker, in the circumstances, if the mover of the Bill, the Minister of Public Service, is done with consulting us – the Office of the Attorney-General –  and if a final decision is taken to have the Bills withdrawn, he will come physically and do so. Be that as it may, the Speaker is the custodian of the rules; you take the decision. Thank you. (Laughter)THE SPEAKER: So, should I decide to withdraw the Bill? Honourable members, let us for once take this House seriously. If you feel that you are not ready for rationalisation, as a House, we are. I do not know why you are withdrawing your Bills; you bring and withdraw. If you are withdrawing the Bill, but again say, “I am writing another letter to cancel the original one –” Let me first hear from Counsel Mutembuli, the deputy chairperson of the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, who is handling the Bill.11.04THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS  (Mr Yusuf Mutembuli):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. We do not want to be seen as a lazy committee when such ping-pong things begin. We are aware of what has happened to the National Legal Aid Bill, caused by the same Office of the Attorney-General. Again, it has started. The Bills are before us, as a committee. Unless we get a directive from the Speaker stopping us from proceeding, we shall proceed and give [Mr Obua]12213THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA THURSDAY , 28 MARCH 2024our report. Whether good or bad, it will be our report. We feel that is what we should do so that we do not have any backlog as far as our committee is concerned. That is our position. THE SPEAKER:  Chairperson of the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, continue with the report and bring it as it is, good or bad. Honourable members, in the public gallery this morning, we have members of the students’ Guild Council of Al-Mustafa Islamic College from Wakiso District. They are represented by none other than Hon. Medard Lubega-Sseggona. You have a very brilliant Member of Parliament. That one is a no-go area, and Hon. Betty Naluyima, who is a mother. You have very good Members of Parliament, irrespective of their party. (Laughter) MR SSEWUNGU:  Madam Speaker, I have a procedural matter. Yesterday, I saw the Uganda Police Force reporting about the performance of their Exodus SACCO. There are a lot of complaints, yet this matter has been handled severally before this Floor of Parliament, of police officers not getting what they want from their savings in their SACCO at the right time. If the SACCO is performing very well, why does it fail to give police officers what they have saved at the time they want it? Both ministers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are senior soldiers. The PS is a serving soldier. The UPDF SACCO is performing very well. What happens with the serving army officers is that they are bound by the oath of allegiance; they cannot complain to their senior officers. I got a police officer complaining that he wants to baptise his two children on Easter Monday; he has gone to ask for the money he saved under Exodus SACCO so that he can make a good party for his children after being baptised, but they have denied him funds. Madam Speaker, I seek for your intervention in this matter so that it comes once and for all. If a SACCO is getting dividends and making profits, why is it refusing to give police officers who are earning Shs 400,000 per month their savings? SACCOs are supposed to help their members get what they need from their savings, but because they fear collared officers with the pips – I need you to help us intervene in this matter because the issue of Exodus SACCO has come up several times. I do not understand how a SACCO makes profits, yet fails to give its saving members money. THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members , I am happy that the committees are looking at the Ministerial Policy Statements. That is a policy issue. I want the Committee on Defence and Internal Affairs to look at that issue and report back to the House. The issue of Exodus has always been Exodus. Mr Chairperson, make a follow-up on that.

As the minister prepares to table the proposed annual budget, I urge him to comply with the requirements of sections 13(9), (10) and (11) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015. I now invite the minister to lay the proposed annual budget for the Financial Year 2024/2025.11.24THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi):  Madam Speaker, pursuant to Article 155 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, Section 13(3), (9), (10) and (11) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and Rule 148 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament, I beg to lay the proposed annual budget for the Financial Year 2024/2025. Madam Speaker, in compliance with the law, I have accompanied the budget with the following documents – and I beg to lay them as follows.Number one, I beg to lay the Appropriations Bill, 2024.THE SPEAKER:  Please, lay.MR MUSASIZI:  Two, I beg to lay on the Table, the Draft Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure (recurrent and development) for the Financial Year 2024/2025 – Local Government V otes.

THE SPEAKER:  Have you received the reasons why the accounting officer has not given you the budget? Be sincere. MR MUSASIZI:  I have given information to this House to the extent possible. THE SPEAKER:  Yes, Hon. Fox Odoi.12219THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA THURSDAY , 28 MARCH 202411.31MR FOX ODOI-OYWELOWO (NRM, West Budama North East County, Tororo):  Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. For purposes of – THE SPEAKER:  Before Hon. Fox Odoi comes in, can I confirm from the Chairperson of the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs whether the Judiciary presented their ministerial policy statement with figures? 11.32 THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS (Mr Yusuf Mutembuli): Madam Speaker, yesterday, we interacted with the Judiciary and there are a lot of issues between the Permanent Secretary/Secretary to the Treasury (PSST) and the Permanent Secretary of the Judiciary. He received information in the morning from the PS/ST requiring him to submit certain documents, but he was hesitant. I think they have issues that must be sorted out. They appeared before us and presented their ministerial policy statement. THE SPEAKER:  I am happy the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs is here.  Hon. Musasizi, why has the Judiciary not given you their budget is because you have refused to go by what they have told you. That is a constitutional vote. MR ODOI-OYWELOWO: Madam Speaker, for purposes of transparency and Hon. Musasizi – who is a very honest man and knows this – the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development set a ceiling for the Judiciary. The ceiling would subject the vote for the Judiciary to substantial budget cuts and the Judiciary explained to them that it was contrary to the law. They, however, still insisted that the Judiciary should submit its budget to the Permanent Secretary/Secretary to the Treasury. The problem with that is this: the Permanent Secretary for the Judiciary cannot feed the figures of the Judiciary into the system for the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development because there is a ceiling. His figures cannot be reflected in their system and the minister knows this. They are implementing an illegality, which they also want to impose on the Parliamentary Commission. THE SPEAKER:  That is a statutory vote. If the President has approved the budget of the Judiciary, I do not see why the PS/ST should come and say he is cutting the – we have just passed an Act where we agreed to increase the number of judges. We are supposed to have two branches of the Court of Appeal, that is, in Mbarara and Gulu, where the minister comes from. If they are asking for an increment in the money and it has been approved by the President, we need to see how to support them. You are the same people complaining of a backlog, yet you are not supporting the Judiciary. Go ahead and lay your documents.11.33 THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi):  Madam Speaker, I had earlier asked for support to have the V olume III; I now wish to lay the Draft (Recurrent and Development) for Financial Year 2024/2025 under V olume III, State-Owned Enterprises and Public Corporations. I beg to lay.  THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. MR MUSASIZI:  Madam Speaker, I wish to lay a list of accounting officers for the Financial Year 2024/2025. I beg to lay. THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. Yes?11.34 MR DICKSONS KATESHUMBWA (NRM, Sheema Municipality, Sheema):  The minister has laid a list of accounting officers – (Interjections)  – you are not the Speaker. I have been given – my question is: over the years, as you laid the list of accounting officers – I hope 12220COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR [Mr Kateshumbwa]this time, you are going to implement what you have laid because we need that commitment. Otherwise, we have had issues here with some accounting officers. Recommendations of Parliament have been made, but no action taken. Madam Speaker, I see the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs has stepped out. As we consider Bills and all these laws we passed, some time back, we tasked the Government to examine all the laws we have passed that do not have regulations. The Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs here mentioned one of the Acts. He said one of the reasons sometimes the police go overboard over the Public Finance Management Act is because of a lack of regulations. Maybe as he lays all these and we approve and make laws, we need a commitment to hear from the Government how far that exercise of ensuring that every Bill that we have, has regulations so that we help people to implement it.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. Government Chief Whip, you have heard the issue of regulations. Please go ahead and lay. Hon. Musasizi, the Member is just asking for something simple. He is saying, as you lay your list, the House hopes that you do not make changes and that the people who have been recommended by this House not to be the accounting officers are being considered. That is all they are asking for. Keep your cool.           MR MUSASIZI:  Madam Speaker, all the documents I am laying here will be the property of this House. I would like to beg the indulgence of colleagues that I lay the documents and then take on the issues afterwards. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I now wish to lay the statement of multi-year commitments – THE SPEAKER:  Did you finish with the accounting officers? MR MUSASIZI:  Yes, I did. THE SPEAKER:  Okay.MR MUSASIZI:  I now wish to lay the statement of the multi-year commitments of the Government for the Financial Year 2024/2025 and the performance of multi-year commitments for Financial Years 2022/2023 and 2023/2024.

Isodo, the Catechist .; the Appropriation Bill is supported by the whole House. Honourable members, from today, you need to take this process very seriously because this is when you are going to know, which money is going where. This is the national cake that must be distributed. If you are going to sit back and say, “I do not mind,” then tomorrow you come crying to the Committee of Budget, “put a road in my place.” This time there is no business of distributing roads and hospitals at the committee level because people who are not in those committees tend not to benefit. Let us distribute the national cake to the whole country and you people must be involved. Government Chief Whip, your ministers keep 12224COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRoff on a budget day. Then they start going to the Cabinet and say, “They removed my money.” Where were you when they removed your money? All of you should be here to pass this budget. MR MUSASIZI: Madam Speaker, in conclusion -THE SPEAKER:  The Appropriation Bill is referred to the Committee of Budget. Chairperson of Budget, your Bill is there. MR MUSASIZI: Madam Speaker, I wish to conclude by informing the House briefly, about what the Budget for the Financial Year 2024/2025 contains. The theme for the financial year 2024/2025 Budget remains; “Full monetisation of the Ugandan economy -THE SPEAKER:  There is a procedural matter, but before I take it on - [Hon. Mpuuga rose_] - we have some guests in the VIP gallery. We have a delegation of staff from the Directorate of Litigation and Compliance Services of the Senate of Kenya and they include: 1. Ms Charity, the Senior Personal Secretary; 2. Miss Nelly Jara, a Senior Legal Clerk; and 3. Mr Jonathan Brima, a Legal Clerk. You are most welcome. They have joined us to witness the proceedings of today.MR MPUUGA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I have meticulously followed the minister laying budgetary documents in compliance with Section 13 of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) and I do not think that I left out anything unmarked. However, I would like to ask the minister whether it was an omission that there was no compliance to subsection 10(d), a statement of tax expenditures of the Government, which effectively speaks to the intended exemptions. I have not seen that laid before Parliament. Was that an omission or a commission? Secondly, I have not heard the minister lay, in compliance with section 13(10)(f), a statement of grants of local governments and any subventions for the financial year.[The Speaker]LAYING OF PAPERSCompliance with subsection 10(a)(5) - the plans for guarantees to be issued in the financial year - I have not heard whether it is an omission or the Government does not intend to issue guarantees. Will the minister clarify whether it is an omission or he will come back with corrigenda at some stage to take us back to the same process?12.03THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi):  Madam Speaker, I wish to thank the former Leader of Opposition. I had actually - THE SPEAKER:  He is a Commissioner of Parliament. MR MUSASIZI: Who is now a Commissioner of Parliament - I had skipped the statement of tax expenditure, which I wish to lay on the Table now.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. That is under Section 13(10)(d). MR MUSASIZI: Regarding loans, grants and guarantees, I laid here a comprehensive document that has all that information. THE SPEAKER:  And it was referred to the committee then. MR MUSASIZI: Guarantees, loans, grants, we have the comprehensive document, which has all this information. Madam Speaker, the budget for the Financial Year 2024/25 is anchored on the theme called; “Full monetisation of the Ugandan economy through commercial agriculture, industrialisation, expanding and broadening services, digital transformation and market access.” The total budget for the Financial Year 2024-25, amounts to Shs 58,340,862,552,130. The key priorities of the Budget for the Financial Year 2024/2025 are as follows: 12225THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA THURSDAY , 28 MARCH 20241. Peace and security; 2.

Musasizi and as Parliament, we are committed to doing what we are supposed to do. We will do our best for the good of this country. Yes, Hon. Sarah Opendi.MS OPENDI:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. We have received the budget for the next financial year. However, sometimes, in this House, we discuss various reports from the accountability committees. While visiting some of the districts like Terego, Abim and while interacting with our local government leaders in Tororo, what was brought to our attention is the challenge that the local governments are having: the issue of returning money –THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Sarah, why don’t we have all these documents, first, laid on the Table? MS OPENDI:  I thought we had finished.THE SPEAKER:  No, we have not. I thought you had the Order Paper. (Laughter)  Check a copy of your Order Paper. MS OPENDI:  Okay. Thank you, Madam Speaker. THE SPEAKER: Do you want me to forget what I am doing? Let me have the documents laid.

Pursuant to Rule 31 of the Rules of Procedure, I invite the Minister of Energy and Mineral Development to lay the agreement. 12.11THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR ENER -GY AND MINERAL DEVELOPMENT (ENERGY) (Mr Sidronius Okaasai):  Mad -am Speaker, I beg to lay a Power Sales Agree -ment for the sale of power to the Uganda-South Sudan border towns of Nimule and Kaya, be -tween Uganda Electricity Transmission Com -pany Limited and South Sudan Electricity Cor -poration.

In accordance with Rule 32(5) of the Rules of Procedure, the agreement stands referred to the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources for scrutiny and report back. Much as it is going to the Committee on Natural Resources – and this is an agreement – I would also interest the legal committee to look at this agreement – jointly. F) ACTION-TAKEN REPORTS PURSUANT TO RULE 220 OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE:1) ON THE NATION-WIDE ELECTRICITY CONNECTION PROJECTSTHE SPEAKER: Honourable members, pursuant to Rule 220 of the Rules of Procedure, where we are supposed to get the actions taken on what was raised in a report, I now invite the Minister of Energy and Mineral Development to table a report on the action that has been taken.12.13 THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR ENERGY AND MINERAL DEVELOPMENT (ENERGY) (Mr Sidronius Okaasai):  Madam Speaker, I beg to lay the statement by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development on the status of electricity connection projects, 15 March 2024. I beg to lay. THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. I refer it to the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources for scrutiny and verification – and this is where the oversight role comes in. If the minister is saying they have connected power to Nyendo, the committee should be able to go LAYING OF PAPERS12227THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA THURSDAY , 28 MARCH 2024and check whether it is true. It should not be a paper response. 2) ON RESPONSES TO PARLIAMENTARY RESOLUTIONS ON THE 25TH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION FOR THE YEAR 2022THE SPEAKER:  Pursuant to Rule 220 of the Rules of Procedure, I invite the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs to table the report. 12.15THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Norbert Mao):  Madam Speaker, I beg to lay the action-taken report arising from the responses to the recommendations made by the Committee on Human Rights on the 25th Annual Report of the Human Rights Commission for the year 2022, in accordance with Rule 220 of the Rules of Procedure of the Parliament of Uganda. THE SPEAKER: Thank you. I refer it to the committees on human rights and legal. Legal committee, I want you to interest yourself in this report. Yes, Hon. Ssewungu. By the way, I had a report this morning from the Banyarwanda in Uganda – (Laughter) -  and the Banyarwanda are headed by a senior Munyarwanda Member of Parliament, Hon. Ssewungu. (Laughter)  They have a petition and we will be having that petition on the Floor next week. 12.15MR JOSEPH SSEWUNGU (NUP, Kalungu West, Kalungu):  Madam Speaker, you are right – and there are very many hovering around here –(Laughter) - but I represent all of them. Madam Speaker, I would like to seek your guidance on the road they have talked about, which matter is going to the Committee on National Economy. The road they have given – and the ministers for finance should pay attention because Madam Speaker has allowed me - the road from Nyendo to Bukalasa is tarmacked, but had challenges when Katonga River was flooded. There is a very serious road from Bukalasa to Gomba, which is just 35 kilometres. I do not know why they are not including that road. I met the Executive Director of Uganda National Roads Authority. When you look at the money they have spent on this small murram road, it would have been saved by constructing a tarmac road. My prayer, if permitted, is that the road from Nyendo up to Gomba should be tarmacked because it is a shortcut if there is a problem along Masaka Road. When I go to the Committee on National Economy, I will raise my issues. As you seek for this loan, attention should be given to Villa Maria-Kalungu-Kyamulibwa-Gomba Road. It will solve all problems. Katonga is already damaged yet UNRA is going to repair it. Why don’t you work on the same road? When you go to Bukomansimbi-Sembabule Road, it is tarmacked. Sembabule to Gomba Road is tarmacked, save for the work on that small part such that my constituency also benefits. Madam Speaker, new districts with no tarmac roads should be given some attention. (Applause)  You create a new district, but you do not give them a simple tarmac. In my constituency, the only tarmac I have is from one Catholic who built a short tarmacked road from the main road to the Catholic Church. That is the tarmac road we have. If that road is given attention under this loan, it would –(Interruption)MR ENOS ASIIMWE: Madam Speaker, Lyantonde District has only five kilometres of tarmac – (Interjections) - and we have been a district since 2006.THE SPEAKER: Honourable  members, when you start saying Lyantonde has five kilometres - I do not even have a quarter, but I am not complaining. 12228COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRMR SSEWUNGU: Madam Speaker, since you allowed me, in good spirit - Hon. Haruna Kasolo is from that region. He knows the road I am talking about. Hon. Mathias Mpuuga knows the road I am talking about. It is the main road from Villa Maria to Gomba and the distance is small. Why do you go for a small loan of 11 kilometres yet you would cover around 45 to 60 kilometres? This is because it is advantageous when the road along Masaka is impassable. So, do not play with Kalungu, honourable minister.THE SPEAKER: Honourable minister, do you have something to say? Let us get a response, and then I get back to you.12.19THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (MICROFINANCE) (Mr  Haruna Kasolo): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I thank Hon. Ssewungu, for raising that matter. Of course, many roads are not tarmacked in the country and because of the limited resources, we have to sequence them. Masaka Region has now got an opportunity for Masaka-Mutukula Road and these other stretches, like the one that connects the barracks, Villa Maria to Kitagate, because this is not a loan, but pre-financing. With time, if resources allow, we shall work on that road.THE SPEAKER: Honourable member, you have heard what the minister has said; that they do it in a phased manner. Okay, there is a procedural matter.MR MAPENDUZI OJARA: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. On three different occasions in this House, I have raised to the Ministry of Works and Transport a very serious matter, where UNRA poorly designed a road in Gulu, stretching from Bank of Uganda to Custom Corner. As a result of this poor design, many lives have been lost. We have accidents on that section of the road almost daily. The honourable minister repeatedly stood up here making commitments that he would dispatch a team to assess, redesign and work on this road. It is painful that we are losing lives. We have repeatedly said this and the Government has committed, but it hurts every time we speak about it, but do not see any action being taken. Madam Speaker, would it not be procedurally right for you to now direct that action be taken immediately and that this road be worked on so that we stop losing lives weekly and the accidents that happen almost daily? Thank you.THE SPEAKER: Thank you so much. I cannot make an order when I am not sure whether there is money or not. Truth be told, we need the road to be worked on, but we need to determine whether we have the finances to that effect and maybe the minister needs to report back to us on that. Dr Lulume - MS OPENDI:  Thank you, Madam Speaker –THE SPEAKER:  I said, “Dr Lulume” and then I will come back here. Members, have you gone to matters of national importance?DR BAYIGGA:  Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. When you mention Dr Lulume, a woman Member of Parliament -THE SPEAKER: There is another doctor. He wants to first clear himself that he is a doctor. (Laughter)12.23DR TIMOTHY BATUWA (FDC, Jinja South Division West, Jinja City): Thank you, Madam Speaker, for this opportunity to put the record right. Right from the days Uganda had one university, there was a course where the best 10 students would be admitted. That was none other than the pharmacy course and they would go to the pharmacy school. Two out of the 10 had to be girls. I was not bright, but I also happened to join, maybe because I passed.Madam Speaker, I am a registered pharmacist under Registration Number, 466, registered as Dr Timothy Batuwa Lusala. LAYING OF PAPERS12229THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA THURSDAY , 28 MARCH 2024THE SPEAKER:  Congratulations! DR BATUWA: Of course, in the medical field, different people specialise in different areas; the teeth and eyes. We specialise in medicine. In Kenya, Uganda, the USA and other countries, where pharmacy is clinical, we go with the title. In Uganda, we are registered that way and that is my registration number. I was registered in 2006, so I have experience spanning almost 20 years. THE SPEAKER: Congratulations. DR BATUWA: Thank you very much. So, I am not a veterinary doctor; I am not a musawo of busolo . (Laughter)12.25DR LULUME BAYIGGA (DP, Buikwe County South, Buikwe):  Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. With the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development here, I would like to address you on a matter of double taxation on the part of private medical practitioners. The Ninth Parliament had an amendment in the taxation bills and in casting wide nets of taxation, they included medical personnel – the pharmacists like Dr Batuwa – and lawyers, among other professionals in private practice who are supposed to pay trade licenses. These professional businesses pay operational taxes to operate their private facilities, including lawyers.The lawyers and pharmacists challenged this provision successfully and the Attorney-General directed that they should be exempted from paying trade licenses because they are not mercantile traders. It also left the medical professionals to fight court battles. Madam Speaker, I beg your attention - two honourable colleagues are – (Laughter)THE SPEAKER: Sorry, I am serving the whole House.DR LULUME BAYIGGA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. The professional business people are not mercantile traders. These include lawyers, pharmacists including us, and medical practitioners practising in private. However, that provision subjected all those professionals to paying trade licenses yet they pay operational licenses to their professional bodies. That would be double taxation. If the pharmacists and lawyers successfully challenged that provision, it should have cascaded to the rest of the government agencies, which have been asking for these taxes from private professional bodies. I demand of the Government that a provision that has been successfully challenged in court does not cascade to the various professionals who were subjected to paying double taxes. While they are paying their professional taxes through the operations of their facilities, they are also being subjected to paying trade licenses. Yet, they are not mercantile traders of rice, sugar and so on. I beg your indulgence to delve into this matter and we ask for justice.THE SPEAKER: Thank you. Government - Finance, there is information from your chairperson.MR KANKUNDA: Thank you, Madam Speaker and colleagues. I appreciate the colleague who has just put his issues very straight and clearly. This is a matter that needs our attention to have a final resolution because there are other sectors, which I am privy to that have been affected. Some of my colleagues like Hon. Kateshumbwa will attest to this. The customs agents pay customs licenses and therefore, they also protest being asked to pay trading licenses. Indeed, what the colleague is saying is that professional bodies who have paid somewhere money that eventually ends up in the coffers of the Government should not be taxed again.Therefore, I agree with you, but I would request that if they put their cases straight, then we can give them attention, especially during this process. Thank you.12230COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRTHE SPEAKER: Honourable minister, the issue of double taxation -12.30THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I do remember in the Ninth Parliament, together with Dr Lulume and others, we debated this matter although I am close to the views he is putting on the Floor. As the Chairman of the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development has said, since we are now in the season, let us go in the committee, discuss this matter and report back to Parliament.THE SPEAKER: Thank you. Foreign Affairs -12.31MS NORAH BIGIRWA (NRM, Woman Representative, Buliisa): Thank you, Madam Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to raise a matter of national importance that requires-THE SPEAKER: We are still on the budget. You will raise yours. Hon. Elijah, are you on the budget? 12.31MR ELIJAH OKUPA (Independent, Kasilo County, Serere): Thank you, Madam Speaker. Mine is regarding the matter of the loans and the roads that the Minister laid. This financial year, we did pass money for the construction of the Mbulamuti-Kamuli-Bukungu Road. However, because the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development delayed bringing the loan to this House, it ended - the agreements were ready by the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA), but somehow within the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, that contract agreement for the construction of that road has not commenced. We again have to budget and put this road back in the next financial year. Could the Minister do these things promptly? We have wasted one year without any work, the contract was signed, but because there is some challenge in the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, I want the minister to take it up.Additionally, I raised and saw - thanks to the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and Hon. Kasolo that you approved a loan for Kumi-Serere-Kasilo Road. I have seen it in the Budget Framework Papers, but the loan has not yet come here. We may run into the same problem. When are you bringing the loan to this House? We do not want to waste one year without work as has happened to the Kamuli-Bukungu Road. Thank you.THE SPEAKER: There is also a problem; when these loans are approved, they are not used as per what they have been approved to do. At the end of the day, we are paying a lot of interest, which is why you find V ote 130 has a lot of money being paid out because of delayed procurement, delayed compensation of Project Affected Persons (PAPs) and that kind of thing. We end up paying a lot of money. We should be able to get loans when we are ready to start work. Otherwise, we are wasting a lot of money paying interest, commitment fees and that kind of thing. Honourable members, we have not completed the budget. Before I have a motion moved, then we are not complete. Earlier on, the honourable minister laid the Appropriation Bill, which we have referred to the Committee on Budget under Section 13(3) of the Public Finance Management Act. The honourable minister should now formally Table the Appropriation Bill, 2024, for the first reading.12.34THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I beg to move that the Bill entitled, “The Appropriations Bill, 2024,” be read for the first time. LAYING OF PAPERS12231THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA THURSDAY , 28 MARCH 2024THE SPEAKER: Is the Bill seconded? Okay, it is seconded by the Government Chief Whip, hon. Fox Odoi. Counsel Yusuf, aren’t you supporting appropriation? Your boss is sitting - you are here on your own; okay, it is supported by the whole House. Those who do not support it can go out. Do you have reasons for not supporting it? Okay, state your reason so that people in Ntungamo should know that you did not support the budget and that they should not expect any service.12.35MR YONA MUSINGUZI (NRM, Ntungamo Municipality, Ntungamo): Madam Speaker, I have only two fundamental reasons for not supporting the Bill. The first one is when you read on the roads that we are appropriating here today, that the people of Western Uganda are bleeding. We have been marginalised by everyone, and we are not happy.If it is a Government project, they say, those people are already sorted. If it is an appointment, they say, those people are already okay. If it is a road, they say, Western Ugandans are okay. THE SPEAKER: There is an order from Hon. Gilbert. MR MUSINGUZI:  Madam Speaker, as westerners –THE SPEAKER:  There is an order from Hon. Gilbert. MR OLANYA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. Hon. Yona – THE SPEAKER: Musinguzi of Ntungamo. MR OLANYA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. Hon. Yona Musinguzi is trying to insinuate something terrible. Looking at the sharing of the cake in this country, looking at the list of people serving as ministers, the permanent secretaries, the army generals, the police and everyone – THE SPEAKER:  Honourable member, I think that was a light moment. I don’t need to know why you are not supporting the Bill. It is your choice and I do not need it on the Hansard . If you have issues with implementation, ours is to pass. Implementation is not on us. Therefore, when you bring up those things - I do not want us to go into issues of regional, tribal, and that kind of thing. Let us not go there. I am the Speaker and I am not from Western Uganda. The Government Chief Whip is here, all the way from a certain village called Ajuri. (Laughter)  Do not tell us about Balaalo .  Chairperson, Committee on Budget – 12.38MR PATRICK OPOLOT-ISIAGI (NRM, Kacumbala County, Bukedea):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise on the subject matter of the budget for the coming financial year. You mentioned that issues at times come to the committee to provide hospitals; among others and those who are not on the committee are at a loss. Now, let us get to know that the right provisions of the law state that Parliament will do oversight of all the funds approved. At the same time, it becomes so complicated to do the monitoring and oversight when we are just lamping up the money. For example, the entities provided by the technocrats; money for roads, but we are providing a budget for a financial year. That means you must have mentioned, which roads are supposed to be done in the financial year so that when you mention, you must justify why it has to be done according to the Munyarwanda , that they have left a certain section of the road. (Laughter) It must be justified at that point in the budget. Why you are constructing this road to Kalungu and you are not constructing the road from Bukungu to Kagwara, must be clear. If we are going to construct health centres, tell us how many health centres you intend to build and their location.If you are building a school, tell us we need money for classrooms, how many classrooms, where and why? Why are you building classrooms in Bukedea yet you are not doing the same in Ntungamo? You must justify. Why 12232COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRare you building health centres every year in Otuke that others do not have? (Laughter)If you are digging boreholes, how many of them are you digging and where, so that we do not get people like Hon. Yona Musinguzi crying from here? I receive it. Thank you, Madam Speaker, for my offer. (Laughter)THE SPEAKER:  Committee chairperson, that is being corrupt. (Laughter)  Honourable members, I would like you to listen. It is in this same House where a complaint was raised that all the hospitals that were given were for only Members in those committees. We are saying that we should have the names of the hospitals and schools, but it must cover the whole country. (Applause)  Let the roads not only go to Bukedea because the chairperson and the Speaker come from Bukedea. Let it be in the entire country. We shall have a list, but national in character. MR OPOLOT-ISIAGI:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. Let us pay attention, honourable colleagues, because even the budget as per the law, is supposed to indicate the outputs and work plans. That means the person in finance cannot say, “Today we are not releasing money for a certain road,” yet you have approved the work plan.Unless what we are doing here is just showbiz. We must work according to the work plans. Therefore, the work plans must come, the recruitment plans must be there, and the money must be appropriated and released according to the work plans. Madam Speaker, according to the law, allow me to declare my gift, which I received from Hon. Yona Musinguzi. It is Ksh 3,000, which is enough for me only. Thank you. (Laughter)The reason I am citing this, soon, I may be stoned by Members, because whenever Members meet me, they say, “My health centre, you have not given me a school.” I am just the Chairperson of the Budget Committee. All the allocations must be done in the ministerial policy statements, you bring the issue, and we appropriate and approve what has to be done in the financial year. I beg to move. THE SPEAKER: Thank you. Honourable members, I have an invitation letter to all Members of Parliament and Staff, from the Parliamentary Anglican Chaplaincy. It reads: “The Anglican Chaplaincy of Parliament is scheduled to hold Easter Carols and Holy Communion service today, 28 March 2024, in Parliament Conference Hall at 4.30 p.m. It will be presided over by the Rt Rev. Hannington Mutebi, Assistant Bishop of Kampala Diocese. The purpose of this letter is kindly to invite you to attend the above-mentioned function.” Signed by Hon. Hamson Obua, MP, Government Chief Whip, and the Chairman, Council Parliamentary Anglican Chaplaincy. Hon. Opolot-Isiagi, we refer the Appropriation Bill to your committee and you must report back to this House as per the dates that have been given. This means that you people have to work very hard and have the budget here. That said – yes, Hon. Sarah Opendi.12.45MS SARAH OPENDI (NRM, Woman Representative, Tororo):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. It hurts for this House to appropriate funds and they are not utilised by local governments because of certain contradictions or challenges within Government systems. Local governments have resources to recruit staff, but they cannot. The Minister of Public Service was here, but unfortunately, he has walked out. As Uganda Women’s Parliamentary Association (UWOPA), we visited Abim and Terego. While interacting with my district leaders in Tororo, this matter was raised. They have the money and some of them have even gone through the process, but the money is going to be returned. Madam Speaker, we need to support local governments because this is where service delivery is yet without staff they cannot do that. [Mr Opolot-Isiagi]LAYING OF PAPERS12233THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA THURSDAY , 28 MARCH 2024However, I also have an issue about a commissioner who went on the radio to accuse this Parliament or members of Parliament saying that we received Shs 60,000 for LCs; and Shs 40,000 for parishes. People have been calling me asking for their facilitation. We have handled matters here of people misusing social media and other media houses. This Commissioner, Hon. Solomon Silwany, needs to come and explain to this House why he went on the radio to raise this matter. You asked us to go and mobilise for NRM, but you did not give us money. That I have Shs 60,000 for every LC -THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, there are things that should be administrative in nature. That is an NRM issue. Do not bring it into the House. That should be handled administratively. Dr Tanga Odoi has been giving money to the structures. Isn’t it true? Do not involve everybody in NRM issues. Honourable members, we are going for the Easter holiday. I wish you the best. I now adjourn the House to 2nd April.(The House rose at 12.48 p.m. and adjourned until Tuesday, 2 April 2024.)
