The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR


THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you to this sitting. As I communicated yesterday, today we expect to complete the work that is active on the order paper so that I am able to adjourn this House for a recess that will be indefinite - sine die - until we are called back to do some work. However, there is a lot of work today and we are going to have to use our time properly so that we can accomplish the task that is before us as outlined on the order paper.

Honourable members, death has occurred to Rt Rev. Bishop Dr Paul Kalanda, Catholic Bishop Emeritus of Moroto, Fort Portal and Lira Dioceses. He was the first African Rector of Katigondo National Seminary. Burial will be on Friday, 21 August 2015, at Bukalasa Seminary Masaka Diocese, Kalungu District. Mass will start at 10.00 a.m. 

Honourable members, those who are interested in attending this send off ceremony to the Rt Rev. Bishop Kalanda are requested to contact hon. Mathias Nsubuga, Member of Parliament for Bukoto South. He will give you the final details for the arrangements that will be for this burial. Please arrange to attend to commemorate his life. Thank you.

MR JONH KEN-LUKYAMUZI (CP, Rubaga Division South, Kampala): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am standing on a point of procedure. Over a month ago, it is on record that the Rt Hon. Prime Minister made a promise before this House to cooperate and come back with a report related to the committee, which was trying to find a solution to the wrangles in the KCCA regarding the Mayor.

The Prime Minister said that within a month, he would come out with a report to state the progress related to the amendments intended for the KCCA Act and also say something about the fate of the Mayor, who has not been getting his salary for such a long time. It is long since the month passed and we expected the Prime Minister by now to have been ready with that report, if he is speaking for a serious Government. I am seeking to know why up to now the Prime Minister has not heeded to the promise he made.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Chief Whip, do we have any information on this?

2.12
THE GOVERNMENT CHIEF WHIP (Ms Ruth Nankabirwa): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Obviously, the Prime Minister is not in the House and he did not forward any answer to what my colleague, hon. Ken-Lukyamuzi, has raised. I may request to step out and find out whether the Prime Minister will be coming to the House today but as of now, I do not have the answer.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay, but honourable members, you recall that this issue has been long standing; so, the faster a solution is found the better it would be for all of us.

2.14
MS BEATRICE ANYWAR (FDC, Woman Representative, Kitgum): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I stand here on an issue of public importance. This House passed the environmental levy on used imported cars and as such, the consequences have caught up with us. 

We have received complaints from the public that this levy, which was imposed by us, as Parliament, is biting. We are aware that before this levy, the Ugandan importers of used cars had all the bonds around the country filled up to capacity and most of these cars were ranging from 1996 to date. The consequence is that the levy increased the prices of those cars and these importers have been stuck with that stock and they can no longer sell it. 

If you went to the bond, a used car at best costs Shs 28 million when you add taxes and this is no longer affordable to Ugandans. Those importing those cars have even gone to the extent of overhauling them as spare parts. The appeal is that we did not consider giving time for those importers to clear their stock, like we did with the Kaveeras where we even gave them six months to clear the stock so that they prepare to implement the environmental levy. 

I have come here to request the House, through you Mr Speaker, that the government reconsiders this because the stock which is currently in the bond cannot be disposed of, it is already junk which we are not even going to be able to clear. We would give them probably six months as we did with the Kaveera. The Ugandans themselves are no longer able to buy these cars; even the new cars are very expensive for an ordinary Ugandan. 

Therefore, it would be prudent that Government looks at this and probably through the relevant minister, come back and brief this House on what can be done to alleviate the situation. The foreign investors are already going away and the government is losing revenue. These are facts of life and Ugandans are being hurt. I beg to submit.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Minister of Finance, do you have something to say on this?

2.17
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Fred Omach): Mr Speaker, this environmental levy was passed by this Parliament and we are now implementing it. If there are petitions, they can be received and looked into and then forwarded to the same Parliament. I thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Honourable members, I communicated in respect of the death of Rt Rev. Bishop Kalanda, a person who has served this country in different places and has passed on and the burial is due. I think we should, as a House, honour him by rising for a minute of silence. 

(Members observed a moment of silence.)

MS CECILIA OGWAL: Mr Speaker, it is true that this Parliament has taken a position on old motor vehicles. The same Parliament has taken a position on Kaveera and we expect that when Parliament makes a decision on anything, it is the Executive that implements it. 

I am very surprised that the Minister of Finance would come to this Parliament and say that because we have taken a decision on second-hand vehicles, it is being implemented without consideration of some African businessmen who may be having stock and may end up with banks taking over the little that they have. The same government should have done the same to Kaveera but up to now, the Kaveera traders are still trading in Kaveera and yet the decision was taken by this Parliament. Why is the implementation being done selectively? Can we be informed? This is because I think it is really wrong; we must encourage traders to do profitable businesses. We should have done an assessment to say that the stock that you have – we will give you maybe two or three months to clear it and then the new -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, you rose on a point of procedure; you are now debating and even accepting information.

MS OGWAL: They are interrupting me, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, no, no.

MS OGWAL: Is it procedurally right for the minister, on behalf of the Executive, to implement the decisions of Parliament selectively? Or maybe wrapping up their own interests and delaying some decisions – maybe because of personal reasons. I must be convinced why up to now the Kaveera has not been dealt with and yet you are quickly dealing with the issue of the second-hand motor vehicles. Is it procedurally right? Thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, procedural matters relate to proceedings in the House; not outside this House. Very soon we are going to start dealing with issues of procedures before some local courts in some villages; that is not for this House. Let us raise procedural matters that relate to the business of the House. However, the point has been made; the concerned people should take note.

Accompanying the Bill is a Certificate of Financial Implications duly signed by the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. I beg to move.

STATEMENT ON POPE FRANCIS’ PASTORAL VISIT IN UGANDA

2.24
MS VICTORIA BUSINGE-RUSOKE (NRM, Woman Representative, Kabarole): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I stand here to give a statement – (Interruption)

MR SSEKIKUBO: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Ordinarily, I would not have interrupted my good friend, hon. Rusoke but the pontiff is a Head of State. Such a statement would have been presented by the Leader of Government Business so that it captures the importance of the visit; it is actually a state visit. For the statement to be moved and a statement made by a backbench member – where is Government in this matter?

Secondly, the preparations are all farfetched – I mean they are wide and deep and involve public spending. Therefore, with all that and in view of our international relations and the diplomacy etiquette, it is befitting that such a statement, which is overdue, must be presented by the Leader of Government Business or a member of that stature but not to be casually presented the way it is being done. 

However, I have no problem with hon. Rusoke; only that I would like to put it on record that this is a very serious statement and we need the position of Government on the papal visit to Uganda. (Applause)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the substance of the statement that I saw yesterday was in relation to alerting members of this House and to ask them to make some contribution to support the process of the papal visit. Therefore, it is not about the comprehensive statement on the visit except that the heading can have those things. However, the purpose of this statement, as I understood it yesterday – unless they have changed – was to make a plea to the members to make contributions to support the process of organising the visit.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I know that you, our Speaker, are very good; you love us to make names. We must thank you for that. Yesterday, I watched TV and there were contributions being made by even the Head of State, with the Archbishop of Kampala. The Prime Minister, the Vice-President and the Governor, Bank of Uganda were there; I am the only one who missed because I should have also been invited.

Mr Speaker, it shows that this visit of the Pope is a very important visit to the people of Uganda and we are ready to contribute whatever we have. However, for a Leader of Government Business – in fact for the State – even for public relations – to allow a Member of Parliament – maybe if it was the Leader of the Opposition, we could have understood or the MP for Kampala we would have understood or the chairperson of a committee – we could have understood - (Interjections) - that is not a big issue.

Mr Speaker, we know the statement is for five minutes but it should be a high profile statement, showing Government’s commitment and preparations but just to allow – no; I do not think it is right.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the statement and its purpose was brought to my attention yesterday by hon. Nambooze, Member of Parliament for Mukono Municipality and it was co-authored with hon. Rusoke, member for Kabarole. However, honourable members, if it is becoming an issue, that statement can be made some other time. 

However, the purpose of the statement is to alert members that the Pope is coming and all of us should make some contribution to support the process. Let us handle it that way; make contributions as you deem necessary. (Applause)

SECOND READING

THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR DISABILITY (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2015

2.35
THE MINISTER OF GENDER, LABOUR AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS (Mr Muruli Mukasa): Mr Speaker, I beg to move that the Bill entitled, “The National Council for Disability (Amendment) Bill, 2015” be read a second time.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is the motion seconded? It is seconded by the Government Chief Whip, the members for Kyenjojo District, Otuke District, Mitooma District, Youth Northern and the member for Kinkizi East. Would you like to speak to your motion?

MR MURULI MUKASA: Mr Speaker, the National Council for Disability (Amendment) Bill seeks to request Parliament to pass one amendment to do with the method of voting for the people with disability.

It seeks to exempt the elections at village, parish, ward, sub-county, division or town from the requirements of Article 68(1) that requires that these elections should be held by secret ballot. We would like to have these elections at those lower levels done by just lining up. 

This method of election is not only cost effective, it is transparent and it is also extremely convenient and quite open for this category of people. It will also tally in very well with the current electoral season that is already in place and has been announced by the Electoral Commission. 

Mr Speaker, I would like to request the House that they endorse this provision and we also give chance for this segment of our society to have their committees and their people elected so that they are not deprived of their chance of electing their leaders.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the motion that has been moved is for the second reading of the Bill entitled, “The National Council for Disability (Amendment) Bill, 2015”. That is the motion that has been proposed for your debate and debate starts now.

2.40
MR NATHAN NANDALA-MAFABI (FDC, Budadiri County West, Sironko): Mr Speaker, thank you very much. The minister has said these people should line up. First, some of the disabled people cannot stand. If you are talking of lining up – (Interjections) - we need to know whether it is by show of hands for those who cannot line up because if the law is talking of lining up, that means they must stand in a line.  Others are sitting; Mr Speaker, we must be clear first before we can deal with this law - (Interjections) - you will move it at your appropriate time; let the minister help me.

Mr Speaker, the minister must come up and tell us the best method for the disabled people vote. There are those who have no mind. They do not have rational reasoning capacity. How would they know that they are voting? How do we help those ones? The law of the disabled must be very clear. How do those who cannot reason vote? Those who cannot stand up, how do they vote? Those who are blind, how do they vote? 

Unless the minister gives us a better method of dealing with the disabled - at least for the youth, we can understand -(Interruption)- would you like to give me information?

MS OPENDI: Thank you, honourable colleague. Mr Speaker, I would like to inform hon. Nandala-Mafabi that for one to vote, they must have registered and if you go and register, then you are a person of sound mind. It is not just anybody that goes to vote; it is only those who are registered who vote whether in party primaries or in the general elections and they are normally regarded as people of sound mind.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: I would like to thank the minister for giving me information. She does not know that the law says the moment you are above 18 years, you can register. It has never said that you must have a sound mind - (Laughter) - this minister reads things upside down. I have the law and it does not say that you must have a sound mind. It is the sound-minded people to hold offices but for voting, it says the moment you are 18 years old, you qualify to vote. Honourable minister, your information is irrelevant.

Mr Speaker, what I would like to put across is that we are ready to help our colleagues who are disabled to vote but we must come up with the criteria of how to vote. Those who cannot reason, how do they vote? Who can assist them; is it the parents or the relatives? Those who cannot stand or put up their hands - we must find the way.

Recently, I asked to see the disabled people because I wanted to give them wheelchairs. I found out that we have different categories of disabled people I had never seen in this world. I saw one who just lay and crawled. When he wants to eat, he opens his mouth as if he wants to chew something to signal that he wants to eat - (Interruption)

MS RUTH NANKABIRWA: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank hon. Nandala-Mafabi for allowing me to seek clarification from him.

Hon. Nandala-Mafabi is raising a very pertinent issue and I would like to know from him whether he would like us to include in the amendment the minister has brought all those guidelines, which would be issued by the Electoral Commission. Would he like us to think about whatever disabilities they are and include them in the Act we are about to make? Would you like to suggest that the minister works with the Electoral Commission to make sure there are guidelines that will follow after passing the major principle of moving away from the secret ballots to lining up as an alternative or would you like us to put all those guidelines?

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Hon. Chief Whip, Ruth Nankabirwa, I have high respect for you; that is why I gave you way. The minister said categorically that he would like to move from secret voting to lining up. My argument is that lining up for the disabled persons is not possible. 

The minister should draw guidelines that whichever method, so long as it is not secret voting, can be used. That is what I am trying to put up and I was giving an example that recently, when I was going to give out wheelchairs, then I saw some disabled people and I do not know if the Government is aware of them. There are many people who cannot even walk. I saw a man who is 28 years old who crawls and when he is hungry, he opens his mouth as if he wants to chew something to signal that he is hungry. How will that one line up?

Therefore, since they have been voting secretly, there must be a method they have been applying and that is why they have maybe been cheating. We may have to amend the law that those who cannot manage to reason should not be able to vote but if we have allowed them to vote - (Interruption)

MR NDEEZI: Thank you so much, hon. Nandala-Mafabi, for giving way. It is not my duty to answer your question; it is the minister’s duty. However, I would like to make one comment in relation to the issue of unsound mind. We should not tag unsound mind to disability. The two phenomena are different. Among many people you see as able bodies, there are so many with unsound minds. You may look at somebody putting on a tie and he is smartly dressed and you may think he has no disability, yet he has unsound mind. Even for some people here, two bottles of beer are enough to make them have unsound minds. (Laughter) 

Therefore, my brother, I request you to ensure that the issue of unsound mind does not come as part of our argument in this case. Thank you so much.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Thank you so much, hon. Ndeezi, for that. You have made my case. In fact even in this Parliament, we could easily have people with unsound minds but they are walking as if they are sound. 

The disabled people should have another method so that those who can stand do so; those who can raise their hands, raise them and those who can use other means do that but not to restrict them to voting by lining up only. That is my proposal and at committee stage, I am going to move that we amend in that line. I thank you, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, in the Gallery this afternoon, we have pupils and teachers of Butiiti Girls’ Primary School in Kyenjojo represented by hon. Muhumuza David and hon. Timbigamba Lyndah. They have come to observe the proceedings. Please, join me in welcoming them. (Applause)

We also have pupils and teachers of St Mary’s Kitgum Boys represented by hon. Henry Oryem Okello and hon. Anywar Beatrice. They are here to observe the proceedings. Please, join me in welcoming them. You are all welcome.

2.49
MS HARRIET NTABAZI (NRM, Woman Representative, Bundibugyo): Thank you so much, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank the minister for the Bill because of the challenges the people with disabilities used to face during elections. Most of them who could not write, as it was indicated by colleagues, definitely could not see the papers and the pens to use for writing. However, for lining up, they can be guided to the lines because most of these people have guides. 

I would like to be challenged on whether lining up means that you stand because sometimes you can line up go when you are squatting, kneeling or bending. Unless I am guided that a line can only be made when you stand up - really, lining up does not necessarily mean that you are standing and that you have two legs and two arms. We must differentiate between standing in a line and lining up. These are two different things. If hon. Nandala-Mafabi, with due respect, thinks that standing in a line is the same as lining up, then he is somehow missing a point. 

Secondly, I would like to talk about the sound mind issue. There are people with different ways of thinking. You may think negatively; when you are not in line with what is on the table and you are called a person with unsound mind. You may have a different perception from the others and people may think that you are of unsound mind. Being of unsound mind does not necessarily mean that you are disabled. 

The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda does not call people with disabilities disabled; we too need to differentiate between people who are disabled and those with disabilities. That is also very important. We have attended many workshops and we have been warned not to call any person with a disability disabled. There are people who have disabilities and are able to do things by themselves. Some have disabilities but they can talk, sing; they may not be in position to see but in position to talk.

We therefore need not call them disabled people because they are able. They can legislate in Parliament, they can produce and they can marry as many as four wives among other things. We therefore should not call then disabled people –(Interruption)

MR NIWAGABA: I thank you, hon. Ntabazi, for giving way. I would like to give you information in respect of the definition of lining up by the free dictionary. According to that dictionary, lining up means a row or arrangement of people or things assembled for a particular purpose – basically, that is the information.

MS NTABAZI: If things can make a line, how about human beings? 

MR SSEBAGGALA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise on a procedural point. You have informed us that you are sending us on recess today and we have a lot to complete. Given the fact that we have already adopted the other system of lining up, is it not procedurally right that we should go straight to the committee stage and have the amendment there and then we move on to other business?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is that okay, honourable members, that we go and deal with amendments if they are there at the committee stage? Is that proper? [HON. MEMBERS: “Yes”]- Can I put the question for the motion for the second reading? Honourable members, can we handle whatever we would like to propose at the committee?  

I put the question that the Bill entitled, “The National Council for Disability (Amendment) Bill, 2015” be read the second time.

(Question put and agreed to.)

BILLS 
COMMITTEE STAGE

THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR DISABILITY (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2015

Clause 1

MR NOKRACH: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would like to move an amendment as follows: in clause 1(1), I propose that we should delete it and replace it with the following words: “elections at the national, district or city level shall be by secret ballot.”

The next proposal I would like to make so that I give my justification is on clause 1(2). I propose that clause 1(2) be deleted and replaced with the following words: “elections at village, parish, or ward, sub-county or town council levels shall be by the electorate lining behind a candidate nominated for the office, their representative’s portrait or symbols.”

The justification is as follows; unlike the youth and the women councils, the council with persons with disability are not elected but appointed. For this and other reasons, Parliament in 2013 amended the National Council for Disability to create an independent electoral structure for persons with disability.

The structure is composed of independent committees at all levels. The structure of the council for persons with disability is not used to conduct elections. This means that the Bill should not mention the word “council”.

Secondly, section 31(a) of the principle Act being amended by inserting a new clause already, has details on the committees that are used to conduct elections for persons with disabilities at all levels of Government. All that is needed is to mention the levels at which the elections are to be conducted; by either secret ballot or lining behind candidates, their representatives’ portrait or symbols.

The third justification is that this amendment is for the purpose of clarity to remove ambiguity. I beg to move.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable member, did you say “lining” or “lining up”?

MR NOKRACH: I said “line behind”. If you say “lining up”, it is creating a lot of debate. People will say lining up means standing up but when you say lining behind, it can even be by means of sitting.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: So it was deliberate to take out the word “up” on the amendment because you had proposed it even in your own amendment. Honourable members, it is now “lining behind the candidate nominated for the office, their representative’s portrait or symbol.” That is in clause 1(2).

Honourable members, you have heard the amendment, can I put the question to that amendment?

MS NAMBOOZE: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I stand to oppose the deletion as proposed in both the motion as moved by the minister and the honourable colleague.

My argument is about something called special and we are here to legislate for our “special interest groups”. I have been checking to see the word special and it means that that special thing must be better and greater in its effectiveness and different from what is usual.

Talking about elections by people with disability brings in so many things that we can be able to appreciate so quickly. For example, some of them will need sign language interpreters, some are being guided by their guardians and we do not want a process where the guardian will be the one to take the vote instead of the voter.

Mr Speaker, I think that if we are to move progressively to legislate for voting of people with disability, we would be thinking about access and mobile polling stations where we could say that these people sleep at such an institution and we take the voting there. Some of them are in hospitals and others cannot even leave their homes to go to polling stations. These are the things I thought we would be thinking about and also that we were going to make the election for people with disability very special from the usual.

Instead, what we are doing by this amendment is to make it as usual and causal as we do for the ordinary people without disability. I also think that for a start, a secret ballot for a person with disability would be retained because this is a highly vulnerable group. Some of them are being attended to by their guardians. I strongly object and I think that to make it appear that we are legislating for a special interest group, we should be looking for ways of making this election special rather than making it usual like those other elections we are holding for any other persons in Uganda.

I beg to oppose it and I would like to request the minister to think about the people with disabilities; that they need something special.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, there are now two amendments proposed to the Bill. The first one is to the effect proposed by hon. Nokrach, PWD, Northern to amend the provision of what is in clause 1.

The amendment being proposed from Mukono is that the whole of clause 1 be deleted so that the provision in the parent Act remains as it is. Those are the two proposals and if you want to comment on them, you can comment now.

MR MWIRU: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I rise to support the proposal by hon. Nokrach and with an amendment. Mr Chairman, you realise that the object of the Bill is specifically in respect of envisaging the cost. However, we have no guarantee that when we take power next time, we may not be better organised to have funds to properly organise these elections. What that means is that we do not need again to come back to Parliament and amend so that we move away from this to secret ballot.

I would like to modify 31(a) by saying that elections for a National Council, District, City Council, Division, Sub County, Parish or Village shall be by secret ballot or by lining so that it creates an alternative that when there is money, it becomes administrative, like the way the Electoral Commission does depending on the budget. If they have money, they can make a secret ballot and in case they do not have, it can be by lining so that they do not need to come back to Parliament again to say that the other amendment took away the right of secret ballot. That is my proposal, Mr Chairman.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, what is being proposed is that there should be two levels; at the National and District level, that should be secret but at the local level, it should be lining up. What you are proposing is a situation of a dual system of leaving it up to the Electoral Commission to choose which method it should use and you are asking us to legislate like that.

MR MWIRU: Yes, Mr Chairman, for a reason. When you look at the object of the Bill, the spirit is that Government is constrained in as far as resources are concerned. We are saying that there can be a better time when there can be resources. Therefore, should Government come back to Parliament, when they have the resources, to amend so that we can vote by secret ballot? I am only saying we can have the two ways - secret ballot or lining up. Thank you, Mr Speaker.

MR MURULI MUKASA: Mr Chairman, I would like to propose that our legislation should be as clear as possible so that we do not cause unnecessary problems to the Electoral Commission.

Having a hybrid and making it an option for this and or would not be quite appropriate. I do not buy into the proposal raised by hon. Mwiru. I have no problem with the amendment proposed by hon. Nokrach. I concede.

MS KAMATEEKA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to get clarification from the honourable minister. It seems that we are making lining up the norm rather than the exception. It would be understandable that now we know that we have financial and time constraints that we allow lining up for the forthcoming elections. However, it should not be for all times, honourable minister.

Therefore, don’t you think that it could be better to have clarity that what we are putting in place is only for the elections for 2016 because people are entitled to their secret vote and in future, the Electoral Commission should be able to organise a secret ballot even at village level because this is people’s right and they are entitled to it.

The clarification I am seeking is; would it not be proper to clearly spell out that the lining up at village and parish level and all these levels is only a temporary measure? Thank you.

MR KEN-LUKYAMUZI: Mr Chairman, I have attentively listened to the two proposals in terms of amendments. I would like to put a question; if ordinarily with people without disabilities lining up has proved to be disastrous, what about if it is mounted under people with disabilities? I propose that this being a special group of people who are vulnerable, they should be considered without any compromise over the issue of free elections.

I also propose that since the number of people with disability is not so enormous, even donors would be delighted to make a sacrifice and ensure that that group undergoes good and unquestionable elections.

I further propose that there should be no debate before a reasonable mind over how fair it would be for people with disabilities to be accorded the opportunity of voting freely without biases.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Can we listen to the representatives of the people with disability on this debate?

MR NDEEZI: Mr Chairperson, our provision was that all elections should be by secret ballot. Whereas we support our colleagues like hon. Ken-Lukyamuzi and others, but we think going by the provisions of Article 93, it is now the minister to move the motion. I hope you know what I mean by Article 93. You and I cannot move the motion. Therefore, let us assist the minister on how to move the motion.

MR WAMANGA-WAMAI: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. These people are a vulnerable special group and how can we collect all of them and put them in one place and make them line-up? Why do we have it in the Constitution that voting will be by secret ballot? Why should we discriminate against these people and say, they must be lined up and it should not be by secret ballot? This is a violation of human rights of these people. They should be treated in a special way; that is why they are called special groups and the Electoral Commission must find money that these people vote by secret ballot.

We cannot discriminate against them; they are special groups and they are fewer. They need affirmative action. I do not see why we should segregate these people. They should be treated equally and vote by secret ballot.
It means that you are going to ferry these people and it is against the law. Ferrying these people form one place to another to go and vote is not right, Mr Chairman.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, we passed the principal of voting by lining up in June this year, in the local Government (Amendment) Act for the villages. We have also just passed one for the youth; there is now this one for people with disabilities; we have another Bill for women and we have another Bill for older persons that we need to handle.

The principal that is being introduced in this amendment is that at lower levels of any election, it should be by lining up for purposes that the minister has outlined.
It is the principal that we have already agreed. If the debate is that the people with disabilities should be left to secret ballot to one group but the rest adopt it, I do not know where debate is going.

MR OPOLOT: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. First of all, I would like to agree with hon. Mwiru who has proposed that we provide for two options. I would like to imagine that whoever is responsible for the elections will use his or her judgement, based on the resources available to determine which method or which mode of voting should be applied. I also know that with time, technology can even influence that.

Mr Chairman, I do not agree with my colleague who said that lining up has been proven disastrous. I would be very glad if something empirical can be adduced here to prove that from my study in this, voting by lining up has generally been proven disastrous.There is this issue which hon. Nandala-Mafabi was - I had said that if you can adduce empirical prove –(Interruption)

MR KEN-LUKYAMUZI: Mr Chairman, I beg to give information to the honourable member. In Kabawo village where I come from, during the most recent village elections when people were lining up to elect their chairperson, in the line was a father of a person who was standing for chairmanship. That father lined behind a candidate who was not his son, the other one was a mother in-law lining against the interest of the son. When the elections were done, the son who did not win the elections because he spotted a mother in-law lining behind his opponent sent his wife away.

As a result, even the father was beaten by the son who lost the election, and he lost his eye. Therefore because of that, most people have come to know that lining up can be disastrous and where possible, it should be avoided.

MR OPOLOT: Thank you very much, hon. Ken-Lukyamuzi, for the information. I agree it can be disastrous but I do not agree that it can be taken in this House that a member asserts that it has been proven to be generally disastrous because the examples you are giving could be real but can easily be taken as hearsay because you are talking about your locality; we should be talking beyond that Kabawo.

I would like to conclude with this issue of state of mind of a voter. I am not very familiar with the law on the state of mind but by the time someone is of unsound mind and has to vote, will it be that person voting or it will be another person voting?

The way the argument is being presented here is almost as if the amendment makes it compulsory for all people with disabilities to vote. (Ms Nambooze rose_)- Hon. Nambooze, you are older than me in this House and I do not interrupt you when you are speaking; I beg that you do the same to me.

Mr Chairman, I agree with what hon. Mwiru said that the Electoral Commission can use its discretion, based on the availability of resources and the technology being used. Thank you very much.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, let me just guide as follows; what we are passing will go into a bracket of a thing called “Laws of Uganda.” One of the principles of legislation of this nature is that there must be consistency. We cannot adopt one principle in ones set of legislation and another in the same body of laws. As a drafts person, that is not permissible. 

We have adopted the principle of lining up in the Local Government (Amendment) Act. We have adopted the same principal in the National Council for Youth (Amendment) Act. Those now go to the body of the laws of Uganda. We cannot now adopt a dual system of leaving it to the discretion of the Electoral Commission in the same body of electoral law, not even talking about the laws of Uganda. You cannot adopt two separate principles in the same set of laws. 

If the principle we have adopted is that at lower level we should allow voting by lining up, that should be the consistent principal to follow. If it has not been adopted, we could use different methods to arrive at the same thing but we have adopted a principle and we should be consistent in legislating.

MR NOCKRACH: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would like to thank members for their submission. I believe now people are becoming more aware about disability than before. I appreciate your concerns. 
It is true we still need to learn more about disability. I would like to explain a little about this type of elections, Mr Chairman. What we are seeing at the lower level is that the elections will be done from the village level. All disabled persons from a village will come together and you may reflect now, in your own village, how many people with disabilities there are.

When they come together, they will elect five people who will elect a chairman. The chairman will be our representative in the local council one. The five in this village will then go to the parish. The number is less; you can imagine in the village how few they are. 

Alt Parish level - it will depend on a number of villages in a Parish. At Parish level they will again elect five and colleagues, I would like to inform you that do not imagine too much that disabled people cannot line up. Logically from you argument, even if we take up voting by secret ballot, you cannot avoid lining up. You come to the polling station and you must go in the line and vote. Therefore, the principle of lining cannot be ruled out in any manner. This is logic. 

I therefore appeal to you that please, from my own experience, you will realise that we have different categories of disability. The visually impaired people go with guides and we know what has happened in polling stations. Some guides were even bribed to vote negatively from what the impaired person wanted. Therefore, lining up will provide an opportunity to that person to make the correct choice – (Interruption)

MR MWIRU: Thank you, hon. Nokrach. So how does that system cater for intellectual disability?

MR NOCKRACH: Your question shows a gap in knowing what type of disabilities there are. Of course people have been referring to unsound mind. Sick people do not vote. During voting, you will go to hospital and find that the sick are there. When you talk about mental illness, I do not know to what degree you are referring to. Those who can vote will come and vote.

Therefore, I would like to conclude by saying that the proposed law by the ministry is fair looking at the situation at the moment. I encourage you not to have any fear. I am talking from experience; we had had weaknesses from our own situations. Members, I appeal to you, knowing your concerns that you are raising on disability, which we appreciate. However, I would like to tell you that the elections of LCI have not taken place for many years due to resources and you are aware of that.

Therefore, if there is any opportunity that can enable the election to take place, I go in for that. It is my humble request, colleagues. Thank for your concern but from our own experience and the type of disability we have worked with who can vote, I am sure this law can make it possible for us.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, I am going to urge you; it is now coming to 03.30 p.m. and we have not even handled 80 per cent of the Order Paper. This Bill is a one clause Bill; we have bigger Bills and bigger issues also coming up. Can we move forward with this Bill? Given the submission of the member for PWD Northern, can we move forward on the basis of that?

MR NZOGHU: Thank you, Mr Chairman. We also have people with disabilities who we represent in our constituencies. However, whereas hon. Nockrach has given their perspective, I am also looking at it from the safety perspective.

You realise that elections can breed tension, acrimony and hatred. We are insisting that this special interest group be given that leverage to continue voting with the secret ballot is to the extent that these disabled people move with walking sticks. Some of these disabled people walk with artificial limbs. Most of them are pushed on wheelchairs. 

Mr Chairman, I have seen a situation in my area where some disabled people, who had walking sticks, after disagreeing in an election wanted to use their sticks to terrorise each other. Therefore – (Interjection) - yes I am just saying – (Interruption)

MR WANGOLO: Thank you, honourable colleague. I would like to give you information. Like you have heard from the mover of the Bill, in June we passed a law for local councils to be voted by lining up. These people also will line up like you will line up to vote for you LCI chairman. Therefore, I do not see the reason why we do not make a uniform law for all leaders at that level LCI and at the parish level. I thank you.

MR NZOGHU: Mr Chairman, as I conclude, if I had known, I would not have given hon. Wangolo space – (Laughter) - because I am trying to look at how we can have these disabled people safe. In an election for example at the LCI general election, the disabled may not breed a lot of tension when they know that they have disability and that they cannot mount any pressure on someone who is able. However, we are saying that all of these people are all disabled and once they are annoyed with each other, for having supported a candidate may be who is not of his or her choice, they can use these walking sticks, clutches to terrorise the community.

MR NDEEZI: Hon. Nzoghu is saying that people with disabilities use appliances to fight each other when they are annoyed. However, we all know even amongst the able bodies, people have sticks, bags and have everything and when they are annoyed, they use them to fight each other. Therefore, the question of fighting each other is not exceptional to people with disability.

Secondly, Mr Chairman, we all know that under Article 68, we had agreed that we all need public elections. As the ideal situation, this is what we all want but we also know that for almost 10 years, the government has failed to make this provision due to lack of money. Therefore, we want a good law but also want something better. Thank you so much.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, can I put the question now? 
There is an amendment proposed by hon. Mwiru and there was the first amendment proposed by hon. Nambooze that the clause be deleted. Can I put the question to that? That the clause 1 of the Bill, which is the only clause, be deleted? I put the question that clause one be deleted?

(Question put and negatived.)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Honourable members, it was a clear no. Can I now put the question to the amendment as proposed, unless hon. Mwiru is going to withdraw his amendment because of the argument of consistence with legislation?

MR MWIRU: Mr Chairman, I had a benefit to listen to the guidance you gave but maybe the other issue which you had not considered was that if we delete ‘secret ballot’ and then we get money, if we are to go by secret ballot, we then have to come back to Parliament again which would be a problem. However, with your guidance, I withdraw.  (Applause)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Congratulations, honourable minister and congratulations, honourable members for finishing these four Bills. Next item.

MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT MOVED UNDER ARTICLE 179 (1) (b) OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA FOR THE CREATION OF NEW DISTRICTS

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Where is the minister? Clerk, call item 14.

MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT TO AUTHORISE GOVERNMENT TO BORROW UP TO SDR 97.9 MILLION ($135 MILLION EQUIVALENT) FROM THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION (IDA) TO SUPPORT THE ENERGY FOR RURAL TRANSFORMATION PHASE 3 (ERT – 3)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, this report was presented yesterday and I proposed the question for your debate and debate starts now. Each Member has two minutes.

MR NZOGHU: Thank you, Mr Speaker. You called item No.10 and you did not give us the status of that item before we proceeded to next one. Therefore, I do not know whether it would not be necessary that you give us guidance on this.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay, we were not able to proceed because the minister is not here. We will come back to that. Instead of waiting for the minister, we can as well do other business.

3.44
MR AMOS LUGOLOOBI (NRM, Ntenjeru County North, Kayunga): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would like to observe that most of the loans associated with power are actually concessional loans. For that reason, I would like to move that we adopt them without debate. They are all concessional and there is nothing much that changes as they all come with very low interest rates. They do not present any problem and we all agree that electricity is a priority. They fall within the national priority programme and it is one sector. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay, it is seconded by Member for – Is it okay that I put the question to that motion? Honourable members, I was going to propose that we open the debate because I had already proposed a question and the sectors are related. If there are issues in 14, 15, 16 and 17 – They all relate to the same sector so if there is any debate, we could debate all of them and then take decisions one by one. 

However, if there is no debate then we can as well  proceed. There are other issues in 18 and 19, which are separate because one of them has a minority report that we might have to have some discussion on. Can we proceed that way? Can I put the question on item No.14?

Honourable members, I put the question to the motion for a resolution of Parliament to authorise Government to borrow up to SDR 97.9 million ($ 135 million equivalent) from the International Development Association (IDA) to support the Energy for Rural Transformation Phase 3 (ERT – 3). 

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I now put the question also to the motion for a resolution of Parliament to authorise Government to borrow up to $ 70.73 million from the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) to support the Grid Rural Electrification Project. I put the question to that motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I equally put the question to the motion for a resolution of Parliament to authorise Government to borrow up to $ 100 million from the African Development Bank (AFDB) to support the Uganda Rural Electrification Access Project. I put the question to that motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I now put the question to the motion for a resolution of Parliament to authorise Government to borrow up to $ 15 million from the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) and another $ 15 million from the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) plus $ 11 million from the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) to finance the construction of the 33 KV distribution project in Kayunga, Kamuli and Kalungu Service Territories. I put the question to that motion.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Item No.18. Is there debate on this item? I think there is a minority report on item No.19. Can I put the question on item No.18? I put the question to the motion for a resolution of Parliament to authorise Government to borrow Units of Accounts 22.5 million from the African Development Fund (AFDB) of the African Development Group for financing the East African Centres of Excellence for skills and tertiary education in biomedical sciences – Phase 1.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the main report was presented but there was a minority opinion on this. I already proposed a question for debate and let us start the debate on both reports and this request and we see how we proceed. Debate starts now.

MR BENARD ATIKU (FDC, Ayivu County, Arua): Thank you, Mr Speaker. First and foremost, I would like to thank you and the House for passing loans that are going to take electricity to our villages.

Secondly, I sit on the Committee on National Economy and I did not append my signature to the main report. I was supporting the minority report that was authored by hon. Dr Lulume Bayigga -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable, the rules are clear. Please, resume your seat.

3.51
COL. (RTD) FRED MWESIGYE (NRM, Nyabushozi County, Kiruhura): Mr Speaker and dear colleagues, I rise to support the report of the committee and support the proposal by Government to borrow money to carry out the procurement of these earth moving equipment.

This procurement was a pledge by the President to the whole country and if approved, will alleviate the shortage of water especially in water stressed districts.

As we speak, the drought in Nyabushozi is nearing disaster level. Cows have started dying and people have no water. This is also in Karamoja. I said, all the water stressed areas are facing a similar situation but I speak for Nyabushozi. Therefore, if any efforts are mobilised towards alleviating the scarcity of water in Uganda, be it for human beings, animals or irrigation, it would go a long way to solve the disaster that is pending in this country.

We should not depend on nature all the time to get water for our cows, for human beings or for our crops, if we are to transform the economy of this country. There is a big plan to industrialise but we cannot industrialise if we do not have water even for our animals or for our crops. Therefore, the procurement of this earth moving equipment should be supported. Thank you, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, let me guide so that we debate the actual thing. This is what happened. The request was made for these monies for earth moving equipment and the banks were clear. The terms apparently stated that, that equipment should be procured from Japan. That was the basis of the minority report, which states, “They have tied the hands of the country; they can no longer do any other procurement; they have given the money and now they also want to supply the equipment.” That was the basis of the minority report, if I captured it correctly.

That would be the debate now. It is not about whether the loan is relevant or not but whether it should actually be tied down and even the suppliers are marked in the loan. That was the issue from the minority report.

3.54
DR LULUME BAYIGGA (DP, Buikwe County South, Buikwe): Mr Speaker, just to add on to what you captured very well, we said yesterday that this loan was very expensive. It is highly commercial and does not have a grace period.

Mr Speaker, this loan is highly commercial and lacks a grace period. Moreover, it does not have a grant element. Therefore, Ugandans would have to shoulder a lot in terms of payment for this loan and it would not be proper for the committee, which scrutinised it - This is a very expensive loan and yet there are other loans, which can be negotiated by Government, which are concessional enough and which you would not need immediate payment. In part, that was why I had to differ.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay, that was the basis for the minority report. 

3.56
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR AGRICULTURE (ANIMAL HUSBANDRY) (Lt Col (Rtd) Bright Rwamirama): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Honourable colleagues, I would like to make some clarifications that from Japan, we got a grant of three sets of equipment and they are offering money. I think that it is also prudent that we buy the equipment from there because it is already tested. 

It is also good to have equipment of one type for easy maintenance. We already have one unit in Eastern Uganda serving the North; one unit in Central Uganda and one unit in the West. We have excavated numerous dams to create water reservoirs for both humans and livestock.

I would beg Members that we pass this loan and considering that we also got a grant from Japan and another grant for irrigation to tame nature in Eastern Uganda covering the districts of Bukedea and Bugisu; we are now lobbying them to get the second phase so that we can cover the other areas.

My brother, hon. Fred Mwesigye’s place is near disaster and we have dispatched every kind of equipment we have to that area to respond to the shortage of water. However, I would also wish you to have the same voice to stop those people who are cutting trees in Nyabushozi. They have cut down all the trees and Nyabushozi is now a charcoal industry. As we use both hands to mitigate the weather conditions, you must also try to limit your people from cutting the trees indiscriminately. I thank you very much, Mr Speaker.

MR PETER LOKII: Mr Speaker, I am rising to seek clarification because I am totally surprised that the honourable minister is saying that they have immediately moved equipment to Nyabushozi because the situation is bad. Barely two or three months ago, we were raising a great concern in this House about the outbreak of Tsetse flies in Karamoja, which were killing all the animals in Jie and Kaabong but there was no such effective dispatch of either resources or drugs. I would like to know whether Karamoja is part of this country or the cows in Karamoja are not part of this economy.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable minister, that was directed to you.

LT COL (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: Mr Speaker, one bird in the hand is worth two in the field. We have the water bowsers but I did not have the chemicals for the Tsetse flies. Now that we have the water bowsers, should we hold them because we do not have chemicals for the Tsetse flies? The answer is no. 

What are doing about Karamoja? We have demonstrated - I have personally been to parts of Karamoja and encouraged farmers spraying ticks to use acaricides that contain dethamycine to kill both ticks and Tsetse flies, like other people are doing in central and eastern Uganda.

We have a project, which is under the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development that is regional because Tsetse flies have no boundaries. We have to do it with Kenya. If we spray in Amudat and we do not spray in Turkana, the flies will cross over. Therefore, the project is on the way. 

It is also not true, Mr Speaker that the Member –(Interruption)

MR PETER LOKII: Mr Speaker, is it in order for the honourable minister to mislead this House that unless animals in the neighbouring countries are sprayed, Tsetse flies cannot be controlled? If you go to the ground, Kidepo National Game Park sends most of its animals grazing along the livestock corridor, which is between Kotido and Kaabong. As a result, there is a permanent presence of buffalos and elephants in the area and being the hosts of the Tsetse flies, they have infested that entire area. Why would you suggest a campaign in Kenya and Sudan where there is no infestation of Tsetse flies? Is he in order, Mr Speaker?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable minister, you now have clear information about what you said. (Laughter)

LT COL (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: Mr Speaker, I am not a liar and I am not about to be one. Personally, I have responded to Karamoja issues as one of them –(Interruption)

MS ROSE AKELLO: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I have all the respect for the honourable minister but it is not true that he has gone to Karamoja or that he has done something for Karamoja. As Karamoja MPs, we have gone to the minister several times and asked him to do anything possible to assist the livestock in Karamoja. 

I represent the people of Kaabong and that is where Kidepo National Game Park is. Animals are dying day and night. Mr Speaker, as Members of Parliament for Kaabong and Kotido, we have gone ahead to use our own money to buy acaricides as if we are Government when the minister is there. Is he in order to continue lying to this House that he has done something for Karamoja when there is contrary evidence on the ground? 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable minister, that is further information for you. (Laughter)

LT COL (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: Mr Speaker, Tsetse flies do not come from buffalos and elephants. They are vectors, which may transmit diseases that may be prevalent among all those animals.

It is true that this matter is of regional concern and if we do it alone, we shall get infestations from our neighbours. We have mapped up and we have a project, which is going to cover all the areas.

Mr Speaker, I would also like to be on record in this House that we have given Karamoja affirmative action in terms of vaccines. We are even launching vaccines on the 7th  September in Karamoja. I say affirmative action because in some areas, vaccines are bought by the farmers whereas in this case, the State is giving them for free.

Mr Speaker, I appreciate the problem of Tsetse flies and that it is a menace. We are sourcing for funds to work with our regional neighbours to rid Karamoja and the entire African continent of the scourge of Tsetse flies. I thank you very much, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the motion is for this request. Can we have a debate on this? I had already picked the Member for Mawokota County South.

4.05
MR KENNETH KIYINGI (Independent, Mawokota County South, Mpigi): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker and allow me to thank the committee for the comprehensive report.

Mr Speaker and honourable colleagues, a stitch in time saves nine. The situation of our roads in Uganda, especially those that are far away in the villages, if not dealt with in time, I believe hampers development and in one way or another, stifles the economy of our country.

Therefore, I support the report of the committee and the fact that we need to have this earth moving equipment in time to replace the equipment we got from China that was not of the best quality. 

Members will agree with me that many roads were opened. However, the equipment that we had did not have the capacity to open these roads. They forced the equipment to do that work and this affected the equipment and most of them broke down.

However, when I get to the matter of cost, I agree with hon. Lulume that cost is very important. In Luganda they say akanyama akatono okayana kali munkwawa, which when translated means you will argue for more when a small piece of meat  is with you. We have already been informed by hon. Bright Rwamirama that there is something good that we are getting from Japan. This is something good for the purpose of having better roads in our villages.

However, for the people in the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, we need to do something about this specific loan because as Members of Parliament, we have been victims of bad loans. If this is one of them, we need to do something. Let it be dealt with amicably. It should not be dealt with as any other loan. If it means paying it back as soon as possible, let us do it to safeguard the future beneficiaries in Uganda that will have to pay for this loan.

On the matter of quality assurance, I believe that something from Japan is of much better quality than that from China. However, I cannot prove this because we also need to give products from Japan due attention. I urge the technical people that are behind this to play their part. Let us not compromise on the quality - (Interruption) 

COL. (RTD) MWESIGYE: Thank you, my colleague for giving way. Mr Speaker, it is very clear that when the President was declining this procurement, he said that Chinese machines had betrayed him and therefore, he prefers to procure equipment from a country that is the only one, which produces caterpillar tractors. This information is very clear. Thank you.

MR KENNETH KIYINGI: Thank you, honourable colleague for that useful information. Lastly - (Member timed out.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, each Member will debate for two minutes. 

4.09
MR STEPHEN BAKKA (NRM, Bukooli County North, Bugiri): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I rise to support the motion that we procure this loan to help us get earth moving equipment.

Mr Speaker, on the issue of conditionalities, I agree with the committee that all loans have conditionalities. I have never heard of a loan without a condition. Even these loan sharks in Kampala will give you conditions when you go there.

Therefore, the idea that we procure this equipment from Japan is agreeable to me because we know that Japan has the best equipment on our market here, specifically Kumaso. It is as good as Caterpillar and this equipment has a very good job here.

I would like to seek clarification from one of the members who authored the minority report. Where did you want us to procure the equipment from because we need to know what you were thinking. Other than Japan, where else do you want us to procure from?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are you not aware that there are some manufacturers in Buikwe? (Laughter)  

4.11
DR MICHAEL BAYIGGA (DP, Buikwe County South, Buikwe): Mr Speaker, I would like to advise this Parliament that neither the committee nor Government had guarantees on the quality of the equipment that is going to be procured. China has got a lot of companies here and they are using their own equipment to do a lot of good work on the roads here. However, most of the equipment that was procured from China is grounded at the district headquarters and yet these districts do not have any money to repair them.

We are saying, this equipment is coming from Japan under the same considerations and this Parliament should be advised by the committee, which scrutinised this loan and the committee should be able to verify to you and persuade you that we saw this equipment and it is the best in the world; there is value for money for this equipment and it is going to be helpful. That is what we should have done but we do not have that capacity.

MAJ. (RTD) RWAMIRAMA: Mr Speaker, I would like to inform the Member and the House that the equipment we are procuring has been tested by engineers in Namalele and found to be preferable. They do not break down, they work in mountainous areas – Yes, they are hardy and mechanically stronger than the equipment that had earlier been procured from China. That is the reason why the Ministry of Agriculture, through the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development wanted the same equipment because they have worked very well for them.

MR BAKKA: Mr Speaker, the minister has said it all. It is common knowledge that Japan has the best machines on our market here and we are not going to go into naming countries, which produce sub-standard products and the like.

However, for Japan, I can guarantee that we have a good deal. I therefore support the motion, Mr Speaker.

4.13
THE MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr Adolf Mwesige): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I rise to support the motion and the majority report of the committee. In essence, I would like to say that from the point of view of local governments, which are going to benefit from this equipment, I would like to state that the local governments needed this equipment yesterday.

We are about to debate a Motion to add more local governments to the number that we already have so it cannot be this Parliament, which seeks to create new local governments, to block a proposal to equip them. The local governments that we have created before and the ones we shall create in future are for purposes of service delivery and this Parliament has a duty to equip local governments to serve the people.

The condition of our roads is seen by everybody and I do not have to implore or to educate Members of Parliament about the conditions of the roads in their constituencies. These are the stories we live every day. I do not think that there is a Member of Parliament who has not received a complaint about the bad roads in his or her constituency.

In most cases, the problem is not that the local governments do not want to work on the roads; the problem is that the number of the equipment available to local governments is not adequate to work on the roads.

Therefore, when I hear that when we pass this loan, every local government in Uganda will get an additional dump truck of eight tonnes, that every local government in Uganda will get a motor grader of 155 horse power, that every local government in Uganda will get a vibro roller, which compacts murram on the roads and I would like to say that there are very few local governments; not more than 10, in my recollection, which have got vibro rollers -

There are graders, which come on the roads to grade and pour murram and the story ends there but that murram cannot stick on the roads because it is not compacted. When I hear the story that every district in Uganda and every municipality in Uganda will get a vibro roller, for me, this is exciting – (Member timed out.)

4.17
MR WILFRED NIWAGABA (Ndorwa County East, Kabale): Mr Speaker, I beg to move a motion that debate be closed and a question be put.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, that requires me to put the question to that motion first. Honourable members, I put the question to the motion that the question be put.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I will now put the question to the motion. You will recall that there was a proposal that this loan should not be approved and that is the basis of the minority report. The majority report says that the loan should be approved.

By dealing with the question of whether we should approve this motion or not, we will have dealt with either minority or majority. 

I now put the question to the motion for a resolution of Parliament to authorise Government to borrow Japanese Yen 15.13 billion, equivalent to $ 131.75 million, from Japan Bank for International Corporation and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation to finance procurement of the earth moving equipment. I put the question to that motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)

MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT MOVED UNDER ARTICLE 179 (1)(B) OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA FOR THE CREATION OF NEW DISTRICTS

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, we had reached a point of – Let me first do this. In the gallery this afternoon, we have pupils and teachers of Buyende Primary School represented by hon. Balyejjusa Sulaiman Kirunda and hon. Babirye Veronica. They have come to observe the proceedings, please join me in welcoming them. I think they have gone. Thank you. Honourable minister, would like to recap on this motion?

4.30
THE MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr Adolf Mwesige): Mr Speaker, the motion had been extensively debated by the honourable members of Parliament and to the best of my recollection, a motion had been moved requesting you to put the question, Mr Speaker. 

However, in your assessment, you did say that this is a motion that requires special standards of voting in accordance with the Constitution namely that in order for this motion to pass, we need half of the Members of Parliament plus one.

Again in your assessment yesterday, the turn up in the House did not seem to meet that standard. Perhaps the Office of the Clerk should now move to ascertain the numbers we have and you proceed to put the question, Mr Speaker. 

Mr Speaker, before the debate closed, the issue of Tororo was an important issue on the Floor. We had a meeting with some of the leaders of Tororo last evening to try and get a harmonised position. We could not reach an amicable solution yesterday and this morning, I got a report that some meetings have taken place among the leaders of Tororo.

Mr Speaker, my own finding is that consensus has not emerged from Tororo. The leaders of Tororo are here, including the minister, hon. Opendi. I would like to invite her to give us the latest brief on consensus building as far as Tororo is concerned. 

However, as I mentioned yesterday, it has never been Government’s intention to block the people of Tororo from getting what they want but over the years, the problem has been the disagreements within the leadership of Tororo, which failed the operationalisation of new districts in Tororo.

Let us listen from the horse’s mouth; from the minister and other colleagues from Tororo and then perhaps we can see how we can move forward with this issue.

4.33
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR HEALTH (PRIMARY HEALTH CARE) (Ms Sarah Opendi): Thank you, Mr Speaker. What happened yesterday was a little unfortunate and I would like to clearly indicate that there have been attempts by the government to grant district status to Tororo County but previously, this met stiff resistance from the leaders because of boundary issues.

As explained yesterday by the minister, it is true that twice, Parliament made a decision on this matter. When new districts were being proposed, there was no way we could bring Tororo again since there was already a position that had been taken by Government and Parliament.

Mr Speaker, this morning, as leaders from Tororo, we met and by lunch time, we had agreed that we could not resolve the matter here because we needed to reach out to the elders in the constituencies.

However, this afternoon, we again received phone calls and positions from our elders who, in their wisdom, decided to meet. We have come up, as leaders from Tororo, with a position that we will request Government to consider.

All the Members of Parliament have signed this document: hon. Ekanya, hon. Fox Odoi, hon. Oboth, hon. Sanjay and hon. Annet, who although born in Tororo and married in Otuke, was in attendance. (Laughter) Yes, she is born in Tororo, married in Otuke and represents the people of Otuke. I have also signed.

Mr Speaker, this is the position following the discussion: that we create a district called Kwapa District to comprise of Tororo County North and Tororo County South.

That we create Nagongera District, comprising of West Budama North and West Budama South and then Tororo Municipality remains the old Tororo District. I am communicating what was arrived at.

It was also proposed - Mr Speaker, can members listen?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Members!

MS OPENDI: It was also proposed that the following areas be granted town council status:
    1. Nabiyoga, Pajuwenda and Yolwa in West Budama
    2. Osukuru, Molo and Milikit in the new Kwapa District
    3. Nagongera Town Council in the new Nagongera District be elevated to municipality status – (Interjections)

Mr Speaker, I am communicating the position of the members who sat in this meeting. Allow me to just -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable, please proceed.

MS OPENDI: Mr Speaker, of course there are procedures that have to be followed now that we are shifting from the initial resolution that was passed by this Parliament. There will be need for us to go through the relevant processes so that we can have this formally submitted to the relevant ministry, Cabinet and then Parliament. That is the position.

Otherwise, for the record, allow me to state that I have never cried in Cabinet. I have never spoken against Tororo District or Tororo County becoming a district because this matter had long been resolved. Therefore, what was stated here is not correct and my colleagues are here to testify to that effect. Thank you, Mr Speaker.

I lay on the Table the minutes of the consultative meeting held by Members of Parliament. (Interjections) We did it hurriedly so excuse us. I am laying the resolution of the Members of Parliament from Tororo District over the creation of districts that has been held today, 20 August 2015. I beg to lay.

4.36
THE MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr Adolf Mwesige): Mr Speaker, I would like to thank Members of Parliament from Tororo for the progress they have made in arriving at the report, which the honourable minister Opendi has just presented on the floor of the House.

As you are aware, Mr Speaker, there are further procedures, which we must undertake. I cannot endorse the proposal without Cabinet’s approval because the motion, which I brought here, is the motion of Cabinet. This proposal from the Members of Parliament from Tororo, from my perspective, will have to be subjected to Cabinet scrutiny and endorsement.

In our usual practice, Mr Speaker, you also heard that part of the package involves the creation of municipalities and town councils. The law commands that a municipality is created by a district council by-resolution with the approval of Parliament. Therefore, in the absence of a resolution from Tororo creating Nagongera Municipality, this House cannot proceed. 

On the part of town councils, they are created by the minister but the minister is enjoined by law to consult the district council. I have not initiated this process yet. Therefore, as far as Tororo is concerned and clearly from what I have said, we need more time to exhaust all those procedures namely, to consult the district council on these proposals. If the district council endorses them, we will introduce them in Cabinet and return to this Parliament for final approval.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Speaker, I think the people of Tororo are not being faithful to us. I have here a letter from the Tieng Adhola Cultural Institution dated 20 August 2015, which is today. It is referenced, “Creation of new districts out of the current Tororo District.” 

They are saying, “As per media reports, the honourable member of Tororo County, hon. Geoffrey Ekanya, dramatically demanded for creation of a district from the current Tororo District. He is further quoted by the Monitor newspaper of 20 August 2015 on page 6 narrating the trauma the people of Tororo went through in their quest for a new district.

As a cultural institution of the Jopadhola within Tororo District, we are not aware that all the people within Tororo District asked for a district. What we know is that the people of Tororo County are very desirous of having a district of their own out of Tororo District.

We are also aware that any form of division within Tororo District that removes the name of Tororo is in the Constitutional Court.

However, in the event and given the facts as foretold, Tororo District may be divided as follows: 
1. 	Tororo Municipality together with Rubongi Sub county and Osukuru Sub County to form Tororo District.

2. 	The remaining sub counties in West Budama to form another district. Likewise, the remaining sub counties in Tororo County to form the third district. 

Signed for and on behalf of Tieng Adhola, the Jopadhola Cultural Institution, Rt Hon. Thomas Okoth Nyuru.”

Mr Speaker, I am trying to say that the minister who has presented has been unfair to us because the cultural institution has made proposals and it has not even raised an issue of a municipality because they are very aware that to create a municipality, you need a district resolution. They are very intelligent.

I had thought that my brother, hon. Fox Odoi, would have also told them the same when they met. At least hon. Oboth is very intelligent. (Laughter)

Mr Speaker, there must be a problem with the leaders – (Interruption)

MR ODONGA OTTO: Thank you for giving way for information. Mr Speaker, we have been waiting for three days and there is a lot of anxiety in all parts of the country over this motion. The Acholi have a very rich saying in English that when a mango is ripe, it does not wait for its friend so that they fall down together.

Under the circumstances, I think we rather leave those - (Interruption)

MS ALUM: Thank you so much, Mr Speaker. I rise on a point of order to our honourable colleague who was holding the floor. Much as there is a saying in Acholi that a ripe mango does not wait for its friend, we have a saying in Lango that when leaves are falling, they wait and fall together. (Laughter) Is it in order for the honourable member from Aruu -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the rules of this House oblige me to use only the English language and the honourable members should not try to think that I know of any other language in this House than this one. (Laughter) Therefore, I am not able to rule on whether it is true or not. Please wind up, honourable member.

MR ODONGA OTTO: The information I was giving is that in the circumstances, we may have to make a decision and leave the issue of Tororo and we proceed with the other districts.

MR NANDALA–MAFABI: Mr Speaker, I have now got a hard copy and I am going to lay it after -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member for Budadiri West, let us not create tension here. From what has been presented by the members as presented by hon. Sarah Opendi, they are all saying that there is need to go back and extract these processes and come back. In other words, they are not saying that we should deal with this now. At least, that is my understanding, which is also confirmed by the minister. 

All the proverbs that have been said are in order because whether it falls or not, it does not - The point is that the people of Tororo have a basis now for going back and then come back to the Ministry of Local Government with the necessary documentation and processes completed. Then they can move in this House when Cabinet has moved this House properly. I think that is what has been communicated and that is the same spirit, which is contained in the Tieng Adhola’s letter; that there is need for going back and coming back properly. 

Let us not try to make a big matter out of this since the matter has now been properly resolved. A process should take place to bring this matter forward again and then we see how to handle it. Let us leave it like that, honourable members.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Speaker, thank you very much for your wise ruling. However, given the fact that Tororo County wants to become a district and it came here and we approved, the issue which the cultural leadership is saying that we can get one county from here to go to the municipality and get the other one from there means – (Interruption)

MR BAKA: Mr Speaker, hon. Nandala-Mafabi should learn to move together with this House because you have ruled that we need to proceed. The members from Tororo are in agreement, the minister is in agreement and the House is in agreement. Why would anyone rise to take us back? Is it procedurally right for the honourable member to rise up and drag us behind on this matter when we have concluded it?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think the issues are clear, honourable members. Please, let us proceed. The issue of Tororo has been resolved and at an appropriate time when the processes are complete, they will come back to the House, through the minister, and we will see how to proceed with the matter. After all, we have districts that are not coming in – I have not seen any district that is not coming some time in the future, unless that has changed. Let us proceed that way.

MS ALUM: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise on the matter of Oyam District. Yesterday, the minister was supposed to go and consult and come back to this House on the matter of Oyam and Tororo. As far as Oyam District is concerned, we have surpassed all that the minister is talking about. We have a district resolution and we have the required population. I sit on the Committee on Local Government and Public Service and there are districts, which have been divided and yet they are new and younger than Oyam.

Mr Speaker, with the district resolution, the demand of the people, economic viability and the strategic location, are we proceeding well to leave Oyam out of this issue?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, we have spoken about how we proceed with this matter; that this matter has financial implications. Therefore, the motion has got to come from the government for us to support and debate it. Can we ask the minister whether the issue of Oyam was one of the issues that you were supposed to report on to the House?

MR MWESIGE: Mr Speaker, I gave my submission on Oyam yesterday but this is not to say that we are not open to listening to the concerns of the Oyam. Unfortunately, we did not caucus on it yesterday. We have not done any other meeting this morning and therefore, Cabinet has not looked at it. I am afraid that I am unable to pronounce myself on Oyam at this stage. Just like we have deferred Tororo because although the leadership has some consensus at parliamentary level, Tororo cannot be considered at this time, let us also take up Oyam and consult further with the leadership in Oyam - (Interjection) 

Yes, I have a right to consult. Even with a resolution, the government has a right to consult the people of Oyam further on the request for a district. Cabinet will also look at it and a position will be brought to this House. However, it cannot be now.

MR NAMBOOZE: Thank you, Mr Speaker. As a country, I think we have taken ourselves to the corner where we are now finding ourselves. When a motion was brought here, it was referred to the committee, which committee came back with a report. The minister allowed for amendments on the floor and a precedent was set that you can amend this motion every other time.

Mr Speaker, when we asked for the formula; a policy on the creation of districts, the minister went to the Constitution. It was very unfortunate that a constitutional provision has not been brought down into a policy. Therefore, basing on the precedent that was set that Members of Parliament –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I ask you to regain your seats. Please resume your seats so that we can take a count to see if we are able to take a decision. I urge all the members to come back to the Chamber and we establish whether we are properly constituted. That includes the members who are walking out when I am talking. 

Honourable members, let us stay in the Chamber to see whether we have the numbers to take this decision. Please proceed.

MS NAMBOOZE: Mr Speaker, a precedent was set here that when Members of Parliament from an area raise their matter, they are given an opportunity to be heard. What are we going to tell the people of Oyam? That we are not going to listen to them? A precedent was set in this House that when members coming from a particular place raise their issues, they are given time and they are heard.

Right now, we have been listening to an agreement or whatever you can call it from Tororo. I think that to be fair, it is now time for every area to be heard, including Mukono. If this is how we are going to do things - What I am raising is, would it be procedurally okay for you to stay debate so that some areas are heard and then not grant the same opportunity to other areas to also be heard?

Some of us shall be blamed by our people that we did not fight for them. It seems that you can come here, organise yourselves and the minister will amend the motion. We are saying, we would like the motion to also be amended for Buikwe, Mukono, Oyam and everybody because that is now the formula. I think that we need time to give each area in Uganda an opportunity to be heard.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, we have a motion, which we permitted, voted and amended. That is the motion we are handling. I cannot go beyond this motion unless the need for it arises. As of now, what we have approved is the amended motion, as proposed by the minister. We received it here and took a vote on it so can we move on this? I need to establish whether our numbers are okay to take this decision.

Honourable members, since this vote requires a constitutional number of members voting and we are not going to voice vote, in which case the size would not be balanced, I am going to use the prerogative under Rule 9 to ask people to sit freely so that we can see how to accommodate each other and we see if we have the numbers to take this decision.

If we do not have it, we do not have it. If we have it, we proceed to take this decision. No, we are going to do that because the vote will be taken by roll call and tally. It is not going to be by any other way. It has to be taken so that the record is clear that we have the numbers. That is what the Constitution dictates. 

MR SABIITI: Yesterday, one honourable member raised the issue of granting districts in 2016. When that is done, that will mean having elections for women again. May I know whether the minister took note of this so that we understand the effect of that? For example, if you give a district in 2016 and yet we have elections in February, it will mean having another election in an area where such a district has been granted. May I know what the minister states on this matter? 

MR MWESIGE: Mr Speaker, the law governing elections in newly created districts is as follows: one, when a new district is created, the Electoral Commission sets up an interim administration comprising of councillors who fall in the new districts for six months. After six months, the Electoral Commission is enjoined to hold elections for local government councillors and the local government district chairperson in that district.

As far as women representatives are concerned, the Parliamentary Elections Act is very clear. When a new district is created, the Electoral Commission is required to organise elections for a Woman MP for that district within two months after the effectiveness of the new district. Therefore, the law is as clear as that.

If, for example, Rubanda District takes effect in July 2016 and I gave the reasons why the earliest we can effect these districts is July 2016, the Electoral Commission will have to put in place an interim leadership for Rubanda District as far the local government leadership is concerned. Within six months after 1 July, the Electoral Commission will have to hold elections for district councillors and district chairpersons in that district. As far as the Parliamentary Elections Act is concerned, by September 2016, the Electoral Commission must make sure that that district has a Woman MP and it has been done before –(Interruption)

MR ODONGA-OTTO: Mr Speaker, I would like to give information that would amount to a professional disagreement with my senior colleague. I handled a petition less than a month ago and I won it. That made me meet the Chairman, Electoral Commission and I posed the same question that hon. Jack Sabiiti has posed, to the Chairman, Electoral Commission, Dr Kiggundu.

He said, “As long as Parliament does not alter the boundaries of sub counties, Electoral Commission is in position to have parliamentary elections at the same time.” The Chairman, Uganda Electoral Commission added that they have the codes for all these counties but the moment the boundaries of counties are altered, it becomes a complex matter and they cannot have elections at the same time. 

Therefore, for the purpose of the districts in class A, in the mind of the Electoral Commission, they are in position to have elections at the same time with us. That is the information that I wanted to give you.

MR MWESIGE: I am glad that hon. Otto said that he is a lawyer and when we are submitting on matters of law, we do not submit our minds; we submit what the law says. Therefore, what I was stating here is the law; it is not what I think. Therefore, you are giving us the mind of the Electoral Commission, I would like to inform you that the Electoral Commission, like anybody, is required to follow the law and I would like to repeat the law.The law says – (Interruption) - Do you also want to state your mind? 

MR ODOI-OYWELOWO: Thank you, Mr Speaker and thank you, hon. Mwesige for giving way. I would like to give you very brief information. Hon. Odonga Otto also said that he is a junior lawyer compared to you. Thank you. 

MR MWESIGE: I now understand the circumstances hon. Odonga Otto was operating in. 

Mr Speaker, on a serious note, the law is very clear and there are Woman Members of Parliament, I think including hon. Cecilia Ogwal and others, who came in as a result of newly formed districts, which became operational after elections. 

Actually, hon. Cecilia Ogwal had lost in Lira Municipality in the general elections but fortunately, before we could go for the general elections, Parliament had created Dokolo District, which would start after elections. That is why she went and participated in the Woman MP elections of Dokolo and came to this Parliament a few months after the general election.

The short message is that when a district comes into effect on 1 July 2016, we will have a Woman MP elected two months thereafter. That is what the law commands. The Electoral Commission has no choice but to hold elections for a Woman MP in that district within two months. Normally, what Electoral Commission does - Because holding elections for a Woman MP requires enormous resources, they normally hold LC V and councillors elections at that same time.

Therefore, we expect those districts that will take effect on 1 July 2016 to have functional local governments and women representatives in this Parliament by September 2016, at the latest.

MR MWIRU: Thank you, Mr Speaker. We are about to take a vote and I am required to pronounce myself on this matter. The procedural issue I am rising is, yesterday hon. Katuntu requested the minister to tell us the proper formula. Hon. Magyezi supplemented by saying that the Local Government Act requires that when you are granting a district or rejecting it, you give reasons. 

Mr Speaker, my understanding of Article 179(4) is that it qualifies the necessity for effective administration and the need to bring services closer to the people as what is mandatory and the others, because it says “may”, are a by-the-way.

I am wondering, Mr Speaker, whether it is not procedurally right that before we take any decision on this matter, the minister should be courteous to us or to his motion to say that, “We are granting this district; it met this criteria and we rejected this one because -” 

Like in the case of Oyam, they had complied with the requirements. The minister should say, “We rejected this one because of this….” That will help us to know that these are the criteria, which are being followed. 

Otherwise, we are moving on without necessarily responding to that procedural issue raised yesterday and it is now looking as if the moment your people call you, you should also say, “I also want.” That seems to be what is being said, Mr Speaker. I seek your guidance on that.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, we have debated this motion and we came to a point where we needed to take decisions except we did not have the numbers to take that decision. I am in the process of establishing whether we have the numbers. The issue of criteria, I think, was handled by the minister yesterday. If it is not satisfactory, it is another matter. (Interjections) No, it was handled by the minister yesterday. What he did is that he presented the provisions of the Constitution on those matters.

Honourable members, we know that the issue of Oyam has come and the response of the minister is what he has already responded. He has to be the one to bring that motion; we cannot bring it from the back; the minister has to bring it so that it conforms to the requirements of the law. That is the point that we are at.So Clerk, can you advise me on how we stand on the issue? I see the Minister of Local Government standing.

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr Alex Onzima): Thank you, Mr Speaker. As we deliberate on very important national issues, it is my prayer that we do the right thing and that we move together as a team.

Mr Speaker, I am in possession of a letter from the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. Good enough, I see my colleagues here who are ministers in the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. This letter is copied to, among others, the Rt Hon. Speaker of this Parliament, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, the Minister of Local Government, the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs – (Interruption)

MS RUTH NANKABIRWA: Mr Speaker, the honourable member holding the floor is a member of Cabinet and a Minister of State for Local Government. In Cabinet we have our rules, which we follow; Cabinet has a code of conduct. I cannot sit back, seeing my member of Cabinet digressing from the decorum of Cabinet without going through the Leader of Government Business or the Government Chief Whip. Is he therefore in order to defy the rules of Cabinet, which he is aware of? Is he in order?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the rules that govern the proceedings of this House are in our Rules of Procedure not anywhere else. (Applause) As Speaker of the House and presiding officer, I cannot bar a member from speaking. (Applause) It would be a violation of the member’s right if I did that. It is up to you to use your mechanisms to handle situations as they arise in the House. The Speaker unfortunately is not a whip of the members. 

MR ONZIMA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am mature in mind and age. I try, as much as possible in my life, to be honest while dealing with issues of national importance. This is a government letter and it is a public letter. I will continue to read the officials to which this letter is copied: The Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, the Minister of State for Local Government, the Head of Public Service and Secretary to Cabinet, the Chairperson of Electoral Commission, the Principal Private Secretary to H.E. the President and the Clerk to Parliament.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Whom is the letter addressed to?

MR ONZIMA: The letter is addressed to the acting Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Local Government. Mr Speaker, according to this letter – 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, just for the record, the Office of the Speaker has not received a copy of that letter because you said it is copied to the - 

MR ONZIMA: The substance of this letter is, “Certificate of financial clearance for a resolution of Parliament for creation of 25 districts, dated 18 August 2015. Reference is made to a letter –“’ (Interruption)

MR BANYENZAKI: Mr Speaker, I respect hon. Onzima in his capacity. Hon. Onzima is a Cabinet member and the letter that he is reading is addressed to the permanent secretary –(Interjections)– okay, let it be permanent secretary. There is no problem. But is he in order to fluke into letters that are not addressed to him? And as a minister, if it is a matter that is to be addressed by Cabinet, is he in order to start sneaking letters from permanent secretaries to Parliament when actually that matter can be decided upon by Cabinet? Is he in order to start sneaking in letters from permanent secretaries as a minister, well knowing that he is bound by Article 117 of the Constitution which reads, “Ministers shall individually be accountable to the President for the administration of their ministries and collectively be responsible for any decisions by Cabinet? Is he in order to undermine the decision of Cabinet when he is collectively responsible? 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I have stated before. Let me state it again that the issues of enforcing Article 117 are not the responsibility of the Speaker. I cannot do that. I am not chairing Cabinet; I am chairing Parliament and the members seated here are Members of Parliament. I cannot block a member unless a member has violated those rules that govern our operations. Therefore, it is your responsibility to handle the situations of Cabinet the way you always handle them but not for the Speaker to handle it on your behalf, please.

MR ONZIMA: Mr Speaker, as I said earlier, I cherish honesty in the interest of my country Uganda. (Applause) We must do the correct things all the time. I am reading this letter in good faith and this is a Government letter addressed to my PS and copied to me and all these other people I have mentioned, including the Office of the President of the Republic of Uganda.

The letter reads: “Reference is made to a letter ref ADM/288/8/293/01, dated 18/08/2015 from the Minister of Local Government, requesting for a certificate of financial clearance to create 25 districts over four years, starting with four districts this financial year 2015/16. Further reference is made to my earlier letter of even reference and date on the above subject. I have subsequently been guided by hon. Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development that Cabinet approved creation of four districts. 

The purpose of this letter therefore, is to clear the creation of only the four districts. The financial implications will be met within the resources available in the METEF ceilings of the respective mother districts in financial 2016/17. Signed by: Keith Muhakanizi, Permanent Secretary and Secretary to Treasury.” 

Mr Speaker, therefore, I would like to know from you how do we proceed in the circumstances? I only need to know that in good faith. Thanks for your audience.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I am required to guide on this - can we have some order. The member raises a procedural point on which I should give guidance. What I have not been able to capture very well is that the request from the Ministry of Local Government was to the effect that the four districts should start this year. I did not hear that bit very well – if I could - was it that it cannot be accommodated this financial year? Please, can I have a copy of that letter?

MR ONZIMA: Mr Speaker, as I said a copy of this letter should be lying in Office of the Speaker and also the Clerk to Parliament but for the purpose of this Sitting of Parliament now, allow me to lay on the Table this letter. I lay it on the Table then it can be transmitted to him and I will get my copy later. Thank you and I beg to lay.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Clerk let me look at it. Honourable members, the request from the Minister of Local Government communicating the decision of Cabinet was to the effect that 25 districts be cleared. And from the Cabinet, four districts were supposed to commence this financial year. 

The communication from the Permanent Secretary was to clear the creation of only four districts and the financial implications would be met within the resources available in the MTEF ceiling of the respective mother districts in the financial year 2016/17. That is the communication. It does not make any comment on the other districts. 

Honourable members, the impact of this is that the budget we passed for the operations of this financial year cannot accommodate the creation of new districts. That is what the letter is saying. What the projection in the MTEF can accommodate is next financial year and for four districts. That is what is saying.

The implication of this is clear because the Permanent Secretary cannot start giving projections beyond the MTEF, which is within his control. And that MTEF should be clearly known that it is expiring in a certain period before another MTEF is set for the next three years and so on. That is why the Permanent Secretary is not committing himself beyond what is not covered in the MTEF. That is my understanding of this letter.
 
However, Parliament has now been confronted by the creation of subsequent districts beyond what is covered by the MTEF. That is up to the proposal that will come in future to accommodate this. That is the import of this letter if I have understood it correctly.

5.23
MR NATHAN NANDALA-MAFABI (FDC, Budadiri County West, Sironko): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Again, we would like to thank you for your wise ruling. Honest views are very important for our country.

Hon. Alex Onzima has raised the issue that the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development is able to use the MTEFs of those respective districts. Let me give example of what will happen. If Kabale has MTEF of Shs 50 billion, just for simplicity, when they create the district, they would split that and share it accordingly. 

However, he has said he is not able to split Iganga to create Bugweri or split Kabarole to create Bunyangabo because of MTEF. It looks as if those other districts’ MTEFs are not able to accommodate any other - the mother districts are not able to accommodate. (Laughter)

Therefore, Mr Speaker, from that, it is very clear the only districts we can create and which will start next year are those four. But the problem – because when I read the letter again as an economist, it says –(Interjection)– okay, the Shadow Minister for Finance, Planning and Economic Development wants to give me information.

MR EKANYA: Thank you very much, hon. Nandala-Mafabi. Mr Speaker, you have always advised us to be neat so that the people who read the Hansard accept our names and the generation to come.

Really, we would like to inform Government that the Public Finance Management Act makes provision, which the minister could consider so that whatever we do is in line with the law. The information I would like to give hon. Nandala-Mafabi is that based on even the four districts, the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development would need to bring a resolution here so that the operationalisation can go into effect. I would like to read Section 20 of the Public Finance Management Act: “Parliament may, by resolution, authorise the minister to relocate funds from a vote to another vote where the functions of the vote are transferred to another vote.”

The import of this, hon. Nandala-Mafabi, is that when we create these new districts, the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development will have created a vote for that new district and we need to bring here a resolution to effect that so that we move neatly and operate within that MTEF ceiling.

Therefore, the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development should process this even tomorrow so that people in areas where we are creating these new units are not delayed in terms of operationalisation because some of these become legal issues, on which the Auditor-General can then raise queries.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Speaker, if the four are the only ones which can hold the others in MTEF, then it means the remaining 21 have no capacity to –(Interruption)

MR OCHOLA: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker and my colleague, hon. Nandala-Mafabi, for giving way.

When I listened to the letter when the minister was reading and the information I am giving is that even the four districts, which are to start in the next financial year - when you look at using the same MTEFs of the mother districts - if we are talking about bringing services closer to the people, when you are going to use the same amount of money on the two districts, you will BE using the same money for service delivery yet at the same time you will have created more administrative costs because where there is one Chairman LCV, where there is one CAO, they are going to be two and even in other offices. So, it is going to encroach on the funds you would have used for service delivery to the people. Why then create these districts?
 
To me, we would rather stay with the old districts the way it is until such a time when Government has money to fund the new ones, then we can come back and have the districts created. That is the information I am giving.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Speaker, that is where I was going. It is very clear now that even the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development is not sincere with its Certificate of Financial Implication. One, there will be a new CAO –(Interruption)

DR BITEKYEREZO: Thank you so much. Mr Speaker, the information I would like to give is very simple, clear and friendly. As we talk, some of the health workers are saying they have not been given their money. The universities cannot open because the money has not been given; all of you know it. 

When hon. Ekanya was giving an alternative policy statement - I was here - he said creation of more districts was going to cause problems here. What has happened to all of you, my colleagues? (Laughter) People do not have salaries. Actually, as I talk, the double cabin car for the DHO of Mbarara District has been snatched by the LC V Chairperson. So we do not even have a car for the district. You are creating more districts for what purpose? Hon. Ekanya, what has happened to you? I thank you very much. (Laughter) 

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Speaker, MTEF, which the Ministry of Finance is talking about, cannot sustain a new district as they are saying. This is because we shall have to get, among others, a new CAO, a new DEO, a new DHO, a new RDC - well, the RDC can be left out because he will come from the President’s office. This money in the district cannot be able to sustain any new district because we cannot say that the salary of the CAO of Kabale must be reduced by a half so that you cater for the salary of the CAO for Rubanda; that cannot happen. 

In that regard –(Interjections)- No, we must be sincere to our country. The MTEF can either handle all the 25 districts or they can go as they are so that we create all the 25 – (Interjections) – I am more informed; I did a masters in economics and –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, are you now debating the certificate or the motion?

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Speaker, what I would like to bring up is that according to that letter, the certificate of financial implication is saying that those new districts will share MTEF of 2016 with their mother districts. That means that the MTEF for Iganga should be shared with the proposed new Bugweri District; the one for Manafwa should be shared with Namisindwa; and the one for Arua should be shared with Madi-Okollo. 

However, it also means that only these four are able to share while the others are not in a position to share. That is my argument. Two, my suggestion, Mr Speaker, as you get set to rule- I would like to plead with you –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I think it is important for us to follow what is going on and debate it appropriately. This is the clearance from the Ministry of Finance: “…the purpose of this letter therefore is to clear the creation of only four districts for the financial year 2016/2017.” That is what it says, and it is from the Secretary to the Treasury and Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance Planning and Economic Development. That is what it is. Are we supposed to go beyond this letter? This is what we have now. This is the guidance we have from the Treasury. How would we go beyond this letter? This is what it says. 

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Speaker, let me conclude. I agree with the letter. We cannot go beyond a letter, so we do not have the mandate for the others. The letter has mentioned four; it therefore means we do not need to talk about the remaining 21 districts, if we are going by that context.  This Parliament is expiring in May 2016 and you cannot do work for the next Parliament.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can I take the Member for Katikamu?

PROF. KHIDDU MAKUBUYA: Mr Speaker, thank you for giving me this opportunity to say something about this important matter. 

First of all, you ruled that you could not prevent a Member of this Parliament, hon. Onzima, from coming to the microphone. I am very happy – (Laughter) - that you ruled in the interest of maintaining the integrity of this Parliament. (Applause) We are now dealing with the consequences of this Member exercising his freedom and tabling this letter.

Mr Speaker, I see you struggling with this letter but frankly, this is a government motion and the Government is here, ably represented by the Vice President, the Prime Minister and all these big people. What is their take on this letter? I really sympathise with you, Mr Speaker, because I thought that this Government, which is ably represented here, should be able to state their take on this letter so that we can move accordingly. Thank you, Sir.

GEN. TUMWIINE: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have been in this Parliament since 1986. By the British system, which we have tended to follow all along, they have what they call the “father of the House” and I would qualify for such. 

I would like to bring out two words in this House as we make our laws - constant and changeable. I would also like to seek information from the Government on what is changeable and what is constant. If the Constitution is changeable, if the laws that we make here are changeable is MTEF changeable or a constant? 

Secondly, all laws and judgements in courts should be made in the interest of the people. Parliament has been debating this motion in the interest of the people. What was raised here in relation to this money business, which is fiction actually because it can disappear in air, is that if we passed the four districts, there might be no money in the next financial year. However, the letter says there will be money in the next financial year for the four. For the others, the Government proposed that they be tapered or staggered deliberately to ensure availability of resources. (Applause) That is a process that I thought would help us move forward movement. 

Money can always be found, where necessary. That is why I am raising the point of a changeable and a constant. The constant is Uganda, the people of Uganda and the interests of the people of Uganda; the changeable is the law, the amount of money and MTEF. Therefore, I suggest that we move with a common focus for the whole country and plan our future step by step. Consider the four for next year and the others in future; those who will be in the coming Parliament will legislate to ensure that there is money for them. I now suggest that we move forward instead of backward movement, otherwise we shall not finish. I thank you. (Applause) 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I see some children leaving. In the public gallery, we have pupils and teachers of Arua Hill Primary School represented by hon. Bernard Atiku and hon. Christine Abia. They have come to observe the proceedings. Please, join me in well coming them. You are welcome. (Applause)

MR DOMBO: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. First and foremost, I would like to thank you for not taking a conservative attitude and taking a liberal approach in allowing a Member to provide information which this House should use in order to make valid decisions.

Mr Speaker, I can see a mis-coordination of troops especially at Cabinet level. Ordinarily, this letter should have been discussed by ministers at ministerial level, maybe at the level of Ministry of Local Government. If there was a disagreement at that level, it would then have been presided over by a senior person at Cabinet in order to bring the varying views together and create harmony so that Government appears on the Floor with a united position. Ordinarily, that is what should be. 

Mr Speaker, according to your interpretation, you are under obligation to safeguard the Rules of Procedure, to safeguard the Office of the Speaker and the Chair but also to safeguard the liberties of the Members of Parliament in order to enable them make substantive submissions. Therefore, I would like to comment partially on the letter and then we can get a way forward.  

Mr Speaker, if you read that letter, it mentions four districts for next financial year; it does not bar the creation of districts in future financial years but it provides technical information. If we chose to move using the right procedure and if there was time - The challenge I see is the constraint about whether we must adjourn today or we must defer this until next week. Ordinarily, if there was time, the best way would have been for Cabinet to go back and put their house in order. That would be the best way to enable the House – (Interjections) - Mr Speaker, may I be protected.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, members!

MR DOMBO: If there was time, we could have moved that way. However, I would like to speak to this as one of the beneficiaries of the creation of districts. Every Member here has a peculiar setting in their district - social, political and economic settings. This impacts on whether there is anything more meaningful that a Member may want to deliver including self-determination by creation of a district. These are pledges that we have all made and people have been very happy.

Mr Speaker, you may recall that last time even when the FDC platform was very clear about prohibiting the creation of districts, the FDC Members of Parliament who were benefiting from those creations came here and supported those motions then. This is because the people they represented back home and the challenges that they had were not in consonance with the FDC platform but they wished to have a self-destination. 

Therefore, as a House we can have a liberal interpretation if there is no time for reconsideration beyond this week. We cannot consider the other districts in the next financial year like the letter says, but let us approve only the four for the next financial year. However, does it stop us from saying something about the other districts in future? That is still subject to interpretation, given the statement from Government. Can Government come up in a strong manner to remove these contradictions which are currently on the Floor emanating from Cabinet?

Rt Hon. Prime Minister or Vice President – When hon. Onzima was speaking, I saw the Vice President move out shaking his head. I do not know whether he had a headache or he was demonstrating –(Laughter)– but that was something that was visible. Can, we therefore –

MS EKWAU: Mr Speaker, the personalities of the Vice President of the country and the Prime Minister of the country, who are seated right in this House when this motion is going on, should not be brought to disrepute in the presence of all of us. Is hon. Dombo therefore in order to make such a statement right in the presence of the persons holding these offices?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I do not think the remarks by the honourable member for Bunyole East, to the effect that he did not know whether the Vice President had a headache or not, were put in good light. Hon. Dombo has no capacity to establish from where he is and he does not even have the necessary qualifications to make the kind of statement he was making. That statement was not proper, hon. Dombo.

MR DOMBO: Thank you very much. Mr Speaker, like you said and like all honourable members know, I am one of the Members of Parliament who puts respect and decorum of this House and hierarchy above everything. The challenge is that when we see gestures, what do we do? My statement did not at any time insinuate or intend to insinuate – Actually, when I looked at the Vice President, he smiled and just laughed it off. It was in that regard that I moved that statement but not in bad faith. To the extent that any member of this House could have imputed that what I said was intended to harm the Vice President, I wish to withdraw it.

Finally, I would like to state - because the facts remain – that we were drawn into this discussion because of the mis-coordination of troops on the Floor by Members of the Executive. I should not have even come up to debate if this matter had been sorted out by the Executive within their rostrum. I would, therefore, request that maybe the Prime Minister, who is the Leader of Government Business, stands up and clarifies the contents of this letter. Did they consider it and find it immaterial for the motion to come here or was it subsequent after Cabinet had sat? This will help the House to make a decision depending on what has been decided. I thank you, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I see the Prime Minister rising.

5.50
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Dr Ruhakana Rugunda): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. There have been some statements wondering whether Government is united over this matter or not. The categorical answer is that Government is solidly united in support of the motion. (Applause)

Secondly, there has been reference suggesting that there is a contradiction between the letter from the Ministry of Finance and the motion. The factual position is that Government openly does its business. We are saying the coming financial year will see the birth of four districts, but we are also telling the country that the plan of Government is to create other districts in a staggered manner so that there is no ambiguity.

Mr Speaker, I believe that there has been a lot said over the last few days. It is also true that some of these districts were promised several years ago. It is only fair, Mr Speaker, that this long debate should eventually come to a conclusion and with your permission, I beg to move that we vote on the motion.

5.52
THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Mr Phillip Wafula Oguttu): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Because we also legislate first for Uganda and then for our constituencies, it would appear the motion we have has no shape of side; it is bi-partisan or for individuals. Many people from both sides are interested in these districts and municipalities because those people who voted for them want them. 

We have said before that the process was handled badly. We have asked for criteria, district by district, so that we understand why one district was passed and another was rejected. The Minister of Local Government has adamantly refused to give us that information. He was quoting the Constitution; for goodness sake, we are supposed to operationalise the Constitution using other regulations! That should have been done.

The party that I represent are very careful about creation of districts which may not be viable. We like to have a more regional government but some people want those small districts to the extent that we are now creating tribal districts. It is very unfortunate that we in this august House sit here to create tribal districts. In the future we are going to create religious districts because there will be no limit to what we are doing.

Mr Speaker, from the letter we have just received, we have only one certificate of financial implication from the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, we can only approve what has been provided for. We cannot approve anything else without a certificate of financial implication because the law does not allow us to. (Mr Odonga Otto rose_)- I do not want your information, thank you very much. 

It is very possible that come May 2016, we shall have a different government headed by different people. Why do you want to create districts for them when the policy of some will be different? If it was my party coming to power, for example, we shall not have any districts; we do not want them. We are even going to amalgamate them. So, do not create districts for us. We can go with these four districts for which we have a letter.

Lastly, Mr Speaker, as we are now we do not have the numbers to pass those four districts – (Interjections) – Yes, as we are now we do not have the numbers. So, I would like to propose that we move on to other matters where we can transact and forget about creation of districts this evening because we do not have the numbers. Thank you very much.

THE DPEUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, if I put the question and I do not have the numbers, the motion collapses. If I put the question and less than half of the members support the motion, it collapses. As we sit now, I have 159 Members of Parliament. The motion requires me to have over 180 Members voting in favour of the motion, which I do not have now. So, I cannot put the question for this decision. Can I suspend decision on this matter and ask the whips to see if they can mobilise Members so that we can proceed? In the meantime, let us go to the next item.

MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT MOVED UNDER SECTION 7 (2) (a) OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACT PROVIDING FOR CREATION OF NEW MUNICIPALITIES

5.57
THE MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr Adolf Mwesige): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker and honourable members. Mr Speaker, when you adjourned debate on this motion, I undertook to go back and request Cabinet to review the motion which I had moved then. I did this with a view to causing an amendment, which would have the effect of adding a number of municipalities on the list of the municipalities on the motion which I had moved.

It is now my honour and privilege to present my amended motion in the following terms: the gist of the amended motion - If I can go straight, with your permission, Mr Speaker, to the list of municipalities. I wish to move that the following municipalities take effect 1 July 2015: Nansana in Wakiso District - (Interjection) - My motion is very clear. I had already read the composition of the motion. I am just amending the motion, so what I do not change stands unchanged; I am not going to repeat. 

    1. Nansana Municipality in Wakiso District; 
    2. Kira Municipality; 
    3. Makindye-Sabagabo Municipality in Wakiso; 
    4. Kisoro Municipality in Kisoro District; 
    5. Mityana Municipality; 
    6. Kitgum Municipality; 
    7. Koboko Municipality; 
    8. Mubende Municipality; 
    9. Kumi Municipality; 
    10. Lugazi Municipality; 
    11. Kamuli Municipality in Kamuli District; and 
    12. Kapchorwa Municipality in Kapchorwa District. 

Mr Speaker, Kamuli Municipality will consist of South and North divisions; Kapchorwa Municipality will consist of East, Central and West divisions. The municipalities which will become effective 1 July 2016 are: 
    1. Ibanda Municipality;
    2. Njeru Municipality; 
    3. Apac Municipality; 
    4. Nebbi Municipality 
    5. Bugiri Municipality
    6. Sheema Municipality; and 
    7. Kotido Municipality. (Applause)

Mr Speaker, Apac Municipality will consist of Agulu, Akere and Arocha divisions. Nebbi Municipality will consist of Tata, central and Abindu divisions. Bugiri will consist of east and west divisions. Sheema Municipality will consist of Kagango, Kabwohe, Kashozi and Sheema Central divisions. Kotido Municipality will consist of north and south divisions.

Mr Speaker, I beg to move that the motion as amended be adopted. Thank you very much.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, this House received a motion which we tried to debate and this an amendment to that initial motion. Is the motion for amendment seconded? It is seconded by the member for Bugabula South, member for Maracha District, member for Budiope East, member for West Budama South, member for Mbarara Municipality, member for Kitgum District, member for Koboko and member for Kaabong. Your motion is properly seconded.

Honourable members, the principle of this motion was presented and the justification was presented by the honourable minister. The amendment falls within the same principle that was presented by the honourable minister. If we need to have any debate, this would be the time. 

MR KAKOBA ONYANGO: Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the minister for presenting this. However, I rise on a procedural matter. The other time when the motion on these municipalities was presented, a number of municipalities were put forward and were supposed to start in 2015. One of them was Njeru Municipality. Now from the amendment that has been presented, all the municipalities that were supposed to commence in 2015 have come on board but Njeru has been moved to 2016. I would like to know why this was done and yet this motion was presented and a lot of hope was raised among the people of Buikwe North that this municipality would come in 2015.

Mr Speaker, why should Buikwe North be treated differently from other areas and yet the original motion had Njeru as one of the municipalities to come in 2015? As people of Buikwe North, we feel this is unfair. We feel that we should be treated the same way as the other municipalities that were brought before. Njeru Municipality should be included in the schedule of 2015.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, there was a slight lapse in the procedure. The amendment to the motion was proposed; I need to put the question to the amendment. Let me do this and then I will get back to you. I now put the question that the amendment to the minister’s motion be in the terms proposed by the minister.

(Question put and agreed to.)

MR SEMUJJU NGANDA: Mr Speaker, thank you very much. I will specifically speak about Kira Municipality. I even consulted the minister and he said that he would leave Kira Municipality the way it had been proposed by the district council.  In fact, the minister even today said municipalities are created by districts. 

The resolution from Wakiso District is to the effect that we create Kira Municipality with a population of 310,000. The motion of the minister now changes what he had earlier proposed and he is adding Nangabo Sub County, which was not part of the resolution from the district. It was not part of the resolution of the minister which he brought.

MR MWESIGE: Mr Speaker, I wish to apologise to my colleague, hon. Semujju Nganda. It is true that the resolution of Wakiso District Council left Nangabo out of Kira Municipal Council. When I had a discussion with him, I had promised to amend the composition of that municipal council but I inadvertently omitted that amendment. I now move that Nangabo Division be deleted from the divisions that constitute Kira Municipality.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, it remains where it was; it was not floating anywhere. An amendment has been proposed in respect of annex No.1 in paragraph No.2 by deletion of Nangabo Division from the list of the divisions that will constitute Kira Municipality. I now put the question to that amendment. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

MR MUWANGA KIVUMBI: Mr Speaker, in regard to Nansana Municipality, the minister is proposing Nansana Division, Nabweru Division, Gombe Division and Busukuma Division. Virtually what the minister is doing in this regard is to lift the whole Kyadondo North Constituency and rename it a municipality, which is not okay.

Mr Speaker, if you want fairness and equity, if anybody looked at the vast nature of this constituency and its composition, you will know that Busukuma is a rural sub county of this constituency - (Interjection) - I know it. I am on a procedural point. When you compare Gombe, which is a sub county also within that constituency, it is another vast sub county on its own. 

In Buganda and in central region, I see an attempt to deny representation. We were fairly cheated when you created counties. Buganda got the least number of counties. In central region in constituencies like this one, you have the biggest number of –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, we need to stay in the House, please. Let us finish the business before us, honourable members.

MR KIVUMBI: Mr Speaker, when you look at the population of these constituencies, they are not like mine which is rural. My constituency is about 40,000 voters. This constituency, which I know from width to length, is almost going to over 150 voters. My humble appeal to the minister is that Nansana Town Council and Nabweru be made municipalities – (Interjection) – Yes, Nansana Town Council, and I am making a case for it. 

Mr Speaker, I am making a very passionate case that Nansana Town Council and Nabweru deserve to be municipalities on their own. You all know them very well because you have lived in Kampala. Gombe and Busukuma can stay part of the rural part of Kyadondo North Constituency. This will ensure equity and fairness. I know there could be political interests of individual Members of Parliament in this area but also the district council resolution is to this effect. Therefore, honourable minister, I beg you passionately to create this municipality to serve a better purpose. I thank you.

MR MWESIGE: Mr Speaker, when we were discussing these municipalities with Wakiso, I personally sat with the Members of the district council of Wakiso. I had a very long meeting with them. So, what constitutes the proposed municipalities in this resolution is what the district council of Wakiso agreed to and I have the minutes in my office. I do not just have the minutes but I also attended this meeting and the Member of Parliament for that area is here to testify because I have interacted with him several times. 

Mr Speaker, I would like to correct the wrong impression created by hon. Muwanga Kivumbi that Buganda has got a raw deal in all this. That is false and unacceptable because Wakiso District alone has given birth to three municipalities and Wakiso is in Buganda. We are creating a new municipality out of Mityana and it is in Buganda. Mubende Municipality is a new constituency in Buganda. Lugazi Municipality is a new constituency in Buganda and Njeru Municipality is a new constituency in Buganda too. I could go on and on.

MR KEN-LUKYAMUZI: Mr Speaker, I stand on a point of procedure regarding what we are talking about now. You know very well that under Article 2 of the Constitution of Uganda, the Constitution is Supreme and binds all of us and other organs of the state. 

Mr Speaker, under Article 178, it is stated that in Buganda, Mengo Municipality is deemed to be a municipality of Buganda. Why have you isolated that constitutional undertaking, which was supposed to have been approved effective from July 2006? What explanation can you give to the people of Buganda that Mengo Municipality is not a municipality of Buganda? Can you isolate Buganda when you are talking about Uganda? Be serious! This is a constitutional matter.

MR MWESIGE: Well, hon. Ken-Lukyamuzi represents a constituency in Buganda Kingdom and he knows very well that the reason we do not have the regional government of Buganda is because – (Interjection) - You cannot talk about Mengo Municipality in isolation of a Buganda regional government. I am talking about the Constitution. Mengo Municipality was created by the Constitution to be the headquarters of Buganda regional government. So you cannot have Mengo Municipality without Buganda regional government.

Hon. Ken-Lukyamuzi knows very well the reasons why up to now the Buganda regional government has not been operationalized; the people who demanded for it eventually disowned it. So the problem is not in this Parliament, the problem is not with Government; the problem is at Mengo.

MS NABUKENYA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise on a point of procedure. In 2013, the people of Luweero applied for a municipality and the Ministry of Local Government received the application. I am also in possession of a document, a minute or proposal, which was sent to the ministry from the Luweero Town Council. A group from the ministry even went to Luweero to carry out the necessary research and evaluation to determine the details of Luweero Town Council.

I am very surprised today that the honourable minister presented municipalities to be approved without Luweero and yet the NRM Government has been continuously saying that Luweero is the hub for them. I have seen several districts that are getting municipalities and yet they cannot even measure up to the development in Luweero District. I would like to ask, is the minister procedurally right to come and present municipalities to this House without being courteous enough to first write to the people of Luweero to tell them that their area could not qualify? I would also like to lay on the Table this proposal, which was minuted by the town council, so that - maybe I can read it.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, that was not a procedural point. Honourable minister, a matter has been raised about Luweero.

MR MWESIGE: Well, I wish the honourable member had brought those documents to me last month because then Luweero would have been part of the municipalities to be considered. Unfortunately, I have no resolutions on my desk from Luweero. I was, therefore, unable to move a motion to create Luweero Municipality without a resolution from Luweero District Council. If Luweero passed a resolution, that resolution is to the knowledge of the MP; it is not to my knowledge. However, I will receive it today and consider it next time.

MR BAKKA: Mr Speaker, considering the mood in the House and after having due consideration of the motion on the Floor - The minister has answered all the necessary questions thereto and Members have debated and the mood is such that we proceed to vote on the motion. I therefore move a motion that this honourable House moves to vote on the creation of new municipalities. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: You move that the question be put; is that what you are saying?

MR BAKKA: I move that the question be put, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I am required by the rules to determine the fate of that motion first – whether the question should be put. I will put the question to the motion that the question be put.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I now proceed to put the question on the motion, as amended. The amended motion is for a resolution of Parliament moved under Section 7 (2a) of the Local Governments Act providing for creation of new municipalities. I will go one by one, and this time for the avoidance of doubt I will read the constitutions of the respective municipalities.

I will now put the question for Nansana Municipality in Wakiso district to comprise of Nansana Division, Nabweru Division, Gombe Division and Busukuma Division. I put the question to that motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I put the question for Kira Municipality in Wakiso District to be constituted of Kira Division, Namugongo Division and Bweyogerere Division. I put the question to that motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I put the question for Makindye-Ssabagabo Municipality in Wakiso District to be constituted of Seguku Division, Bunamwaya Division and Ndejje Division. I put the question to that motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)

MR ODONGA OTTO: Mr Speaker, I am sorry to raise this point of procedure during voting, but I have a letter from the Permanent Secretary, which is saying that the Government is not in position to fund the creation of these 11 municipalities. It has been copied to the Rt Hon. Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Local Government and the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs. 

The procedural point I am therefore raising is: should we be able to proceed without a certificate of financial implications when we have a letter from the Permanent Secretary, Mr Keith Muhakanizi, stating clearly that creation of new municipalities is not affordable to Government? I beg to lay this document on the Table.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, the motion is by Government and it is up to Government to handle it.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I put the question for Kisoro Municipality to consist of Central Division, Northern Division and Southern Division. I put the question to that motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I put the question for Mityana Municipality in Mityana District to be constituted of Central Division, Ttamu Division and Busimbi Division. I put the question to that motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)

(Question put and agreed to.)

I put the question to that motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I will now go to municipalities to come into effect on 1 July 2016. I put the question for Ibanda Municipality in Ibanda District to be constituted of Bufunda Division, Kagongo Division and Bisheshe Division. I put the question to that motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I put the question for Njeru Municipality to be constituted of Njeru Division, Nyenga Division and Wakisi Division. I put the question to that motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Apac Municipality –

MR TONNY AYOO: Mr Speaker, when the district council made a resolution, Apac Municipality was supposed to have four divisions - Agulu, Akere, Arocha and Atik. However, on this list, I see only three divisions with Atik left out. I want to know from the minister whether it was a typing error or something else.

Mr Speaker, I beg to propose that Atik Division be included among the divisions in Apac Municipality as per the district council resolution. I beg to move.

MR MWESIGE: Mr Speaker, I am sorry this was an error. What the Member of Parliament is presenting is what came from the district council. My technical committee had looked at the financial capacity and that is why they had downsized the number of divisions. However, the law is clear; we have got to follow what the district council has said. So, I will support his amendment.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The amendment is to include Atik. Honourable members, I now put the question for Apac Municipality consisting of Agulu Division, Akere Division, Arocha Division and Atik Division. I put the question to that motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: I put the question for Nebbi Municipality consisting of Tata Division, Central Division and Abindu Division. I put the question to that motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)
THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Bugiri Municipality consisting of Eastern Division and Western Division. I put the question to that motion.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Sheema Municipality consisting of Kagango Division, Kabwohe Division, Kashozi Division and Sheema Central Division. I put the question to that motion.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Kotido Municipality consisting of North Division and South Division. I put the question to that motion -

MS MARGARET ALEPER: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I just want to remind the minister that when the resolution by the district council of Kotido was presented to the ministry, there were four divisions but here we have only two. This can be confirmed by the technical persons from the ministry. The one we have here is north and south divisions and the ones missing are central and west divisions. My appeal is that they should be included. I therefore move that the two missing divisions be included in this amendment. Thank you.

MR MWESIGE: Yes, Mr Speaker, I agree to the addition of west and central divisions.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I now put the question that Kotido Municipality consisting of North Division, South Division, Central Division and West Division be created.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. Honourable members, the pending business of the House, which is on the Order Paper, will be handled when we resume after this recess. 

Honourable members, it is my duty now to wish all of you the best in the things you are going to do during the recess. This House stands accordingly adjourned sine die until notice is given to you to come back.

(The House rose at 6.33 and adjourned sine die.)
