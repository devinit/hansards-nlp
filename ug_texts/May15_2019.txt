The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you to this sitting. I should have communicated some other way but I thought it was courteous to come and communicate to you because you are already here. 

We have some emergency – to support a colleague of this House who has been befallen by a tragedy - so, we will not be able to proceed. We were supposed to have finished with the Roads Bill today and the minister is already here, but I am going to Mukono and the chairperson of the committee is already there for the same activity - the burial of hon. Kibuule’s twins who passed on. So, we will not be able to proceed. 

House adjourned to tomorrow, 2 o’clock.  

(The House rose at 2.21 p.m. and adjourned until Thursday, 16 May 2019 at 2.00 p.m.)
