SECOND READING

THE UGANDA WILDLIFE BILL, 1996

MINISTER OF STATE FOR WILD LIFE AND ANTIQUITIES (Mr Bachou): Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would like to thank hon. Members for the overwhelming support they gave this Bill in the discussions of yesterday; and I will take this opportunity to respond very briefly to some of the issues which were raised so that we can continue with work ahead of us. One of the major issues raised was the question of research but looking through the Bill, this is adequately covered in Clause 6 item 9 on page 15. This issue was raised by hon. John Ntimba; and I think it is a very relevant issue indeed; and I am happy to note that it is fully covered in the text of the Bill.  

Other issues which were raised particularly by hon. Imaga from Arua regarding the poverty in the North being caused essentially by the allocation of fertile lands in the North for the purposes of Forest Reserves, Game Reserves and National Parks.  I think this was a misplaced observation because as you know very well that human nature being what it is, is the major cause of environmental destruction. The animals are quite aware that they cannot destroy their own habitat because doing so, would mean that they will have no where to live. I wish man could think in the same manner, we would be able to maintain our environment the way nature provided it for us.  As far as the issues raised regarding the prevention of people in the Western region to indulge in the production of profitable crops like coffee, I think you know very well if this was a colonial problem, it ceased to be a problem by the time of Independence.  

Today in the West Nile region, both in Arua and Nebbi districts, coffee is produced and particularly Nebbi on a large scale; and beginning about 10 years ago, coffee is being produced in Arua too.  So it is a matter of somebody being indigenous just like in business you can choose also to produce crops not necessarily because your area was demarcated for crop A or B or C;and I think the debate that followed from there involving predominantly hon. Members from the West Nile region, under scores the observation that I am making right now.  In general, the theme of the discussions yesterday supported the Bill overwhelmingly.  

Hon. Kanyeihamba raised the question of the destruction of habitat for wild life and in the major town particularly in the city of Kampala.  I think this requires consulted efforts on the part of all parties concerned; and we hope that with the event of NEMA, National Environment Management Authority which will be a coordinating body for environmental management in the country, that, that forum will be used adequately by all Ministries concerned to put together their efforts in order to make sure that these efforts are coordinated and there is no un warranted destruction of the habitat from which we all derive our livelihood.

Mr Chairman, I was pointing out one major issue yesterday that what this Bill is trying to do is simply to create yet another pillar of the management system that we need under the auspices of the Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities.  I mentioned yesterday that the Uganda Wildlife Authority is the body that is going to be taking care of the major tourist attraction which we have, which is mainly environmental in nature, and which is mainly available in the parks and in the Reserves right now.  

There are of course other management pillars of the Ministry of Tourism; there is the Uganda Tourist Board, which does the promotion or the marketing aspect by coordinating essentially the private sector in market in Uganda as a tourist destination.  Of course, we also have the training wing and so on; and shortly after this Bill has been passed by this Honourable House; I have no doubt that will be done. We will be presenting to this Honourable House another Bill; and this will be about one aspect of training. You may recall, we already went through with another Bill in this House about training in predominant Hotel services and catering. This other one will be about training people to manage our wild life.  Mr Chairman, thank you very much. I beg to move.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that the Bill be read the second time.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Order, order hon. Omara Atubo. This is not a political campaign ground we are in Parliament. Hon. Adonia Tiberondwa you are fond of raising points of order here because of lack of quorum, but you rarely attend. You are always getting out. (Interjections)

DR TIBERONDWA: The Chair, but I think that this Parliament is not a school where the Chairman is the Headmaster. I am sorry, Mr Chairman, I feel very concerned that you are treating us like school children.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: It is not correct, hon. Tiberondwa. You will recall that yesterday 126 hon. Members signed then a half of them walked away in five minutes. Order, if you could listen to hon. Tiberondwa. It is this House that must ensure that all the Ugandans who are working must be fairly paid; and if it is this House which is going to encourage payment out of no work, I think it is very unfortunate. But as you are raising a point of order, we are already making a quorum please. Let us proceed.

DR TIBERONDWA: Point of order. Mr Chairman, while the Chairman can rule that debates can continue without a quorum, but when it comes to taking a vote, Is it in order for us to take a vote when we have no quorum? A few minutes ago we were only 43 out of a possible 90 to require it to form a quorum. Is it in order, Mr Chairman? Especially, when we are going to vote.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Hon. Tiberondwa, your Colleagues are sitting outside discussing. We shall ring the bell and continue. Please, ring the bell.   


PROF. KANYEIHAMBA: Point of information. Mr Chairman, I do not know when the decision was taken, but I met two Members going outside in a very ugly mood and they said they had found something written I did not read it myself. Saying that books will be signed at 4.00 O’Clock, so they said they will come back at a quarter to 4.00 O’Clock. (Laughter)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Hon. Members, kindly take your seats.  You see this kind of measure has been taken by the accounting officer in charge of finances to ensure that you are here, and you are paid your allowances, and you must work for it; and you have been given enough information ahead of time.  There is nothing wrong with that.

MR ASIKU: Point of information. Thank you very much, Mr Chairman.  It is really a pity towards the end of this House’s life, we seem to be forced to do things which looks unconstitutional.  Obviously when we are making law, the majority should be -the quorum should be formed to pass a law.  Of late something abnormal is happening not with the administration, but generally with Members of this House.  I sympathize with one thing. When we have been here for the last 6 years, programmes have been running in a normal way.  

Finally, it appears we are under pressure that we must finish everything Uganda needs at this particular season so that the next Parliament has nothing important to handle.  That is what seems to be happening.  Because -(Interjections)  
       
THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Hon. Asiku, just give the information and take you seat please.

MR ASIKU: Okay.  The information now is that, most of the people in this House are preparing for campaigns, they come and sign and run back to their constituencies to solicit for votes.  So that is why we do not form a quorum. It seems the ambition is that, they would like to campaign because the period is coming to a close. Would the House -administration I think, if necessary may be, to release them officially.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: You see hon. Members, I really sympathize with most of you.  You are very busy, there are so many things you are doing I understand. But at the same time, there are things you must do here for the country. It is a contract. So what we are doing here arises from your decision; and you must also understand that you are the country. Because this House will go on recess according to programme. But there are other things you must do so that you also have time over the weekend.  But most of you are around here in Kampala. Yesterday 126 signed and went away. So, please hon. Members let us proceed there is a quorum. Could we take the count. The Clerk please, take the count. For that matter, we shall adjourn for 15 minutes.

MR OMARA ATUBO: Mr Chairman, I think possibly we could take few minutes to discuss how to solve this problem properly.  Because if we are trying to rub over it we may never go deep enough to try to find a solution to this problem of lack of quorum. Which is going intensify by the way, as a Presidential polling day nears, and then we go into the parliamentary election.  

So, I have about two suggestions, Mr Chairman.  One; that the executive should sit down with our committee in charge of business in this House and really should decide on the legislation that we should handle before we go for all these elections.  After all, if you look through article 264 of the constitution, it is very clear there.  It is really giving the NRM government 9 months during which they should basically organize election. That is really the business that the government which-that is article 263 and 264. Article 263 talks of 9 months and article 264 talks of in particular the business that the interim government should handle.  But now the government seems to be so interested and Ministers for that matter, to bring about all types of legislations. Yet these legislations to me, like all laws are of course, for the good of the country, they are important, but you see they are not so fundamental and basic that if you do not make it before the 7th of July, this country will collapse. We can do without these wild life things -(Laughter)- you know the law on nurses, the law on what. These animals are there whether the law is-these colleges, these nurses are there, this water thing and so on. These 9 months will not make such a basic difference. This Lawyers thing and so on, they are always there, they have been there since colonial time and they will continue to be.  

So, Mr Chairman, what I am proposing is this. I think we are over burdening ourselves on certain responsibilities which honestly we should not be tackling during this critical period since 8th of October up to 7th of July. This Parliament should be guided by the government to handle laws which fundamentally relate to election first and foremost; and secondly certain basic things like constitutions and so on.  So, for me, in my honest opinion, this lack of quorum is going to worsen as we near the period of elections and, therefore, sensibly, and logically, it will be very important for the executive to sit with our relevant committee and say these are the most important legislations we should handle; and we should be told like the Minister for Education has told schools that they are closing on the 4th. We should be told that this Parliament is going to adjourn on such and such a day; and I will be pleased. We are not being dissolved, we are going to adjourn at least two weeks before the Presidential elections. Under the constitution, you really do not dissolved as such, you expire as a new Parliament takes over, we try to avoid this situation where Parliament is dissolved, you create a vacuum between one Parliament succeeding another one, and in between any dictator can take advantage of the absence of parliament and do any other thing.

So, Mr Chairman, my summary is this. You in the Chair there, in charge of the business of this House, I feel that we should find a workable solution, call it a permanent solution to this.  Let us have a deadline when this Parliament will go a few weeks before the Presidential election, and even after that when most of the people here are going to compete in the parliamentary election, I do not see any way by which government will give us business.  So, Mr Chairman, I think let us find this solution and really finish off a few of these legislations, which are  important and we go and help our people to make up their mind on the elections. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I think hon. Omara Atubo has summed up all the important points which we must take note of.  I do agree with him, and everybody agrees with him.  It is only unfortunate that some of these Bills were done by the government side.  Then we would like to dispose of them.  Because we are now mid-way, we have spent a lot of unnecessary time on them, and there is one or two things which this House really needs to also deliberate, especially the consequential amendment on election.  This is crucial because it is for everybody including all of you hon. Members. 

So, I would like to plead with you that there are only a few things, and I think the responsible authority is aware when you will be told to go either sine die, but that one is already handled.  We do not need to worry. But our concern is at least to pass that consequential amendment which concerns everybody.  It concerns you, it concerns those who are campaigning and all these and that; and that is why you are always asked to remain around.  We are very sorry really that you are being embarrassed by these new administrative measures here and there which has not been the method of work here, I do not enjoy it, I do not like it, and none of you likes it. But because of your importance in the House, that is why administrators are desperately wanting you to be around. So I really do regret the inconveniences caused to all of you. I think let us proceed because we are taking a lot of time here. So, if we make a quorum let us proceed.

MR OKURUT: Let us not lay ourselves bear as a House for anybody to raise a constitutional problem. The constitutional problem could arise if certain very crucial Bills or whatever it is are passed without the attendance of Members particularly when you are saying that it is only at 2.00 O’Clock when you sign.  My attendance here can only be shown by me registering. But if I do not register, and should anybody in future raise a constitutional issue that we did as a Parliament or for that matter National Assembly pass a Bill or a crucial issue without the presence of Members, we are going to be in trouble. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Hon. Members all that we are saying here is to ensure that, the necessary quorum is realized so that we handle expeditiously those few Bills which are remaining; and this is what we have been doing  the rest of the afternoon. So if we make a quorum please, hon. Members I ask your indulgence let us proceed.  We have taken note of you concern. Now we make a quorum. I now put the question that Bill be read the second time.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 8

DR YYEKO: In Clause 8 sub-section 4, I propose that the word first be deleted from the last sentence where it is, amend the first Schedule.  There is no first Schedule in this thing.  There is only Schedule. So the word first should be deleted.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: But hon. Yyeko with due respect I did not receive the amendment in time.

MR BACHOU: I thank you, Mr Chairman. I think it is in order since there is only one Schedule.  There is no problem with that amendment. I accept it, thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that Clause 8 be amended as proposed by hon. Dr Yyeko.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 8 as amended.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:I now put the question that Clause 8 as amended do stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 9

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Also with due respect hon. Wanendeya, I did not receive the amendment ahead of time.
            
MR WANENDEYA: Mr Chairman, if we are to make any effort, then we should try to agree if we are to get this legislation. Mr Chairman, it is really simple amendment under 9 (2) (e). ‘With the approval of the Minister, make bye laws for the management of Wildlife and Wildlife conservation’ I beg to move.

MR BACHOU: Mr Chairman, I do not really see the purpose of this amendment.  I think that as it is-, this is open for other people to make a contribution as other than just the Minister giving his approval before by laws can be made for the management of Wild Life and Wild Life Conservation. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: In other words, the Minister is not in favour of your amendment. I now put the question that Clause 9 (2) (e) be amended as proposed by hon. Wanendeya.
 
(Question put and negatived.)

Clause 9

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that Clause 9 do stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 10

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that Clause 10 do stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 11

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that Clause 11 do stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 12

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that Clause 12 do stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 13

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that Clause 13 do stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 14

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:I now put the question that Clause 14 do stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 15

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that Clause 15 do stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 16

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that Clause 16 do stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 17

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that Clause 17 do stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 18

MR ATEKER EJALU: Point of clarification. Mr Chairman, in Clause 18 (1), I would like to seek clarification from the Minister whether the areas which can be designated according to that Clause can possibly include land belonging to an individual.  Because if it is, then it is in conflict with the constitution.

MR BACHOU: Thank you, Mr Chairman. The word consultation includes consultation with owners of land and which means, therefore that, if the authority indicates that the land belongs to an individual and then consultation will be undertaken with the private owner of the land as well; and, therefore, I think the point is that, literally any lands that could fall under with, with consultation and acceptance or approval of all interested parties could fall under this. Thank you.

MR ATEKER EJALU: Further clarification. The clarification given by the Minister is not satisfactory. Because if consultations with the local authority and approval of Parliament, there is no provision here that the owner of the land is to be consulted first. It is not there. 

MR ONGORA ATWAI: Mr Chairman, all through this Bill that the committee has handled, the committee was from time to time referring to the constitution; and I think we all know, and are all conversant with the constitution as regards compensation which is stipulated in article 26. If the gazetting means encroaching into the individual’s land, it then follows that, that particular article has to be followed.  There is no way government will grab anybody’s land just because it is to be for wild life use.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that clause 18 do stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 19

MR WANENDEYA: Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Clause 19 (2) (c) and 19 (3) (c) are taking care of by Clause 19 (4). So, I propose that they be deleted. That is 19 (2) (c) and 19 (3) (c) because they are covered under Clause 19 for the interest of those who should be interested. It says, any other area, the Minister may declare as a Wild life protection area. That is on page 23 and on 24 (iii) any other area, the Minister may declare as a wild life management area; and Clause 19 (4), says, the Minister may by statutory instrument declare any other area other than areas under sub-sections 2 and 3 to be conservation area. Mr Chairman, that I believe takes care of those two sub-Clauses and therefore they should be deleted. They are just extra ordinary for the sake of those who draft our Bills, they should be aware of that.  Thank you.

MR BACHOU: Thank you, Mr Chairman. There are two key words here that are being disregarded by the hon. Member who is seeking an amendment. The first word refers -in 19 (2) (c), we are talking of a protected area, and then (4) we are talking of a conservation area, and in (3) (c) we are talking of the management area.  Those are key words because they relate to the type of role that will be played in managing this area.  One is the management area another one is simply protection; another one is conservation. So, simply for a matter of emphasis and detail that is why they need to remain as they are. Thank you, Mr Chairman.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Hon. Wanendeya, that one is clear enough. There is a difference between protected area and management area as well as conservation area as explained by the Minister. I think it is clear enough.  I now put the question that Clause 19 do stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 20

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that Clause 20 do stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 21

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:I now put the question that Clause 21 do stand part of the Bill.  

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 22

MR WANENDEYA: Mr Chairman, 22 (c) and 22 (e) under sub-Clause 1 are taking care of by 27 (e). Therefore, I propose that they be deleted because they are in 27 (e). I beg to propose.

DR BACHOU: Again if the hon. Member proposing an amendment were to go into the details involved. He would realize that, technically we are referring to different things in these Clauses and, therefore, I cannot accept those amendments.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that Clause 22 do stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 23

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that Clause 23 do stand part of the Bill.

(Question put and agreed to.)

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 29

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that Clause 29 do stand part of the Bill. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 30

MR WANENDEYA: I would like to add (g) to Clause 30 sub-section 1 so that it would read, “General extraction plus G that is plants harvesting” The reason over here, of harvesting trees or plants is that, in case in the forests and indeed where a wild life conservation or wild life -a Park has been created, the people in the neighbourhood should be allowed to harvest, especially trees which have fallen rather than just leaving them to rot, Mr Chairman. (Laughter) I beg to move.

MR OKWERA: (Interruption)- by hon. Wanendeya on the ground that people can go there in advance to try the trees so that they go and harvest it next year. Thank you.

MR BACHOU: Timbers are wild life products, and I fail to understand why the hon. Member wishing to move this amendment is so particular about timber. When actually timber is already covered under wild life products.  So I oppose the amendment, Mr Chairman.  Thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I now put the question that Clause 30 be amended as proposed by hon. Wanendeya.

(Question put and negatived.)

MRS SSEBAGEREKA: Point of procedure. Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Considering that most Members are here, and we are going to -(Interruption)- Bill before we all signed, I strongly recommend that we sign the registers and pass the Bill. It is unconstitutional, Mr Chairman to pass a Bill without signing.  The registers have been withdrawn.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Hon. Victoria, we discussed this matter before you were here, and we agreed that we must proceed. We also looked through the interim rules of procedure of National Resistance Council of Uganda before me here, and there is no provision whatsoever in these rules about the signature. So there is nothing constitutional about it. But we have taken note let us proceed. I now put the question that Clause 68 do stand part of the Bill.

MR WANENDEYA: Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I propose that we add  sub-Clause 4 read as follows; “The Board shall pay 50 per cent fees to the local government as a portion of revenue collected from the area surrounding the National Park and  Wild Life Reserves” Mr Chairman, -(Applause)- the money I propose should be paid to the local government.  The reason over here as an example, the money collected from Mt. Elgon National Park is not given to people at all-no portion is given to people in Mbale. The same thing applies to the people in West Nile and in Western Uganda, and wherever you can find Parks.  Mr Chairman therefore, I strongly propose and the Minister this time would not refuse, but agree to that as an important element in promoting -(Interruption)

PROF. KANYEIHAMBA: Point of information. Thank you, Mr Chairman. I do sympathize with the Amendment proposed by hon. Wanendeya.  But the dues paid from local resources and forests and so forth are a complex accounts which are governed in fact even by a formula in the constitution, and they are part and parcel of the relationship between central government and local governments which would be in appropriate to be inserted here.  Because there are other matters to be taken into account when you are determining what dues and what percentages should be paid to local authorities. While that point is very well driven home, I believe that this would be in an appropriate position where to assert that percentage. It is a matter to be calculated in accordance with a whole range of relationship between local areas and central government in accordance with the provisions of the constitution.  I thank you, Sir.

MR ONGORA ATWAI: The point that hon. Wenendeya is raising is important; and in Clause 13 of this particular Bill, there is the indulgence of local authorities; and not only that.  Right now may be only in Mbale area which is to be probed.  Communities around these Parks are already enjoying.  They are involved and a certain percentage goes back to them.  Right now as I talk, we were in Bwindi, we were in Mgahinga, all these other places, and we found that the local communities are already involved and they take these Parks and these other areas as their own and, therefore, a certain profit goes back to them.

MR ONGOM: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I rise to support hon. Wenendeya, only that, apart from what somebody says is a wrong section.  I would perhaps say that we do not necessarily determine the percentage to be given to a local authority, but rather put in a such a way that the percentage will be decided from time to time. So that we do not fix the percentage firmly here. 

But otherwise, Mr Chairman, these wildlife conservation areas must be seen to be profitable to the people around.  Otherwise I may not support it properly.  Whereas I agree with hon. Atwai there, that in some areas they are already benefiting, and yet those are really restricted only to the immediate-the people who are around the Parks.  But the general population of the districts concerned who should also benefit do not necessarily benefit at the moment.  So this provision, Mr Chairman is important.  Only that I would suggest that we may not have to fix the percentage but ask that this percentage be fixed from time to time.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.

MRS MASABA WAFANA: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. I do concur with my hon. Brother from Mt. Elgon that, it is important that we work out a proportion whereby the local people can also benefit from this forest.  The courts of law in the municipalities, they share the profits.  The High court takes some, and the Municipality takes some; and I think if the Minister for Finance and Economic Planning worked out a policy whereby the local people can also benefit considering that Mbale district is a small area with a lot of population, and we have no where to go to fetch firewood, we have no where to go to get electricity in some of the rural areas. It is very important that government considers the appeal of the local people so that we share something from the Park for the development of our local people. I thank you, Mr Chairman.
  
AN HON. MEMBER: Mr Chairman, I do sympathize with the recommendation passed by hon. Wanendeya. But I want to say one thing that when you are doing conservation, you not necessarily doing commerce. Conservation and commerce are quite different. Two; that most of these areas that we are looking at are not all very viable commercially. But even certain areas have to support others. So when you have to say that you put up a certain percentage, you are not yet aware of which areas are very productive and which ones are not; and it is because of that reason that even these conservation areas like Parks are getting subvention from the government. Because, on their own, they cannot support themselves looking at where we have come from. So, I would not support that we put a certain percentage, but only to say that the boards or these authorities from time to time can always see out of what they are earning and how much can go back to the local population.  I thank you.

MR OKWERA: I rise to support the amendment moved by hon. Wanendeya. Mr Chairman, we have seen a number of government parastatal bodies being created.  Some of these parastatals make good money. They do not take some of this money back to the treasury.  The money stays with them and it brings about the tendency of misusing the funds. Mr Chairman, the Natural Parks in particular are one of the Uganda’s biggest foreign exchange earners; and also local people who go to those Parks, they pay very handsomely; and therefore, Mr Chairman, it is very likely that these National Parks will definitely make money. Where does the money go?  Here in the statute we have not said that some of these profits would go to the consolidated fund.  I am therefore agreeing with hon. Wanendeya that at least 10 per cent of total revenue collected from these Parks should go to local authority. Thank you, Mr Chairman.

MR IMAGA: Point of clarification.  Mr Chairman, in terms of accounting, I do not know how possible will this money be collected, and a percentage be paid to local authority.  To my point of view, all the charges are to meet the services rendered. Now, what will this payment to the local authorities go for.  Because the services will be rendered by the central government through this authority; and the payments will be to cover the services rendered in case the authority runs short of money, it is the central government which pays money for the authority to run. So, what particular area does the local authority play to deserve this payment? 

DR BACHOU: Thank you, Mr Chairman.  The concern that has been expressed by hon. William Wanendeya obviously has received support from various Members. But Clause 71 is talking about sound financial and commercial practice, and you know very well, Mr Chairman, that hon. Wanendeya is regarded as somebody who is an expert in this field; and I would really wonder forgetting about the principle. What he thinks is magical and, therefore financially and commercially sound about 50 per cent. That is biggest query we have. 

Nonetheless, I wish to bring it to the attention of this House that the Uganda National Parks has already worked out a revenue sharing formula with the local communities surrounding National Parks.  Whereby up to now, in so many of these Parks, the local communities are already receiving 10 per cent of gross revenues realized by the National parks; and in addition to that, the National Park authority together with some NGOs operating in these National Parks are availing technical and managerial support to the local communities to establish and maintain income generating activities in these areas with the support of the Uganda national parks; this is already in built in the mechanism because even the local communities will be participating and have already been participating in managing the national parks around them, and for that they have been considered for these revenue sharing formula.  I do not see any particular reason why we should put the 50 per cent suggested by hon. Wanendeya under clause 71.  So, I do not accept that Amendment, because here we are talking about sound commercial and finance management, not about the distribution of revenue. Thank you, Mr Chairman.

MR NKALUBO WASSWA:  Mr Chairman, I wish to draw the attention to the Members, the terminology which is being used by hon. Wanendeya.  When you speak of revenue, what is revenue?  Now, when you speak revenue it includes our own money which will appropriate from here.  You have to be very clear when you speak of a certain percentage; what do you want to tax?  Otherwise you will find that we give money here, and if we pass it as he puts it, as revenue, revenue means all the money whether appropriated by this House - that is what we call revenue, or income.  Now, the moment you leave it as it is, it means that all the contribution whether it is coming from out will be subject to taxation.  Let us get this clear, what we want to tax; which one should go to the local authority; maybe, he wants revenue from taxes for those who have gone to these parks, that is where I would say that is where we can only tax.  But if you are going to tax even the government contribution, I am afraid, we will be making a wrong decision.

MR WANENDEYA:  Point of clarification.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I clearly said the board shall pay 50 per cent of fees to the local government as a portion of revenue; fees, not all the revenue.  So, there is a very big difference.  Mr Chairman, not only that, but I do not want the Minister to mislead us; if he has got some place where we can place that clause, I will be grateful, but this, of course, when we say duty to operate on sound, financial principles, investment and borrowing powers, this can still be put under this clause as opposed to some other place.  But if the Minister has got some place where it can be put, I will be most grateful.  

Mr Chairman, when it comes to graduated tax, we agreed in this very august House that 50 per cent of the revenue collected at sub county levels remains there, as opposed to go to district councils.  So, we agreed to that as a principle.  

In the past, if Members would recollect, the money when it goes to district council Treasuries, it was disappearing in then air; but not if it were to be used properly, it would benefit the people. (Interruption)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  Hon. Wanendeya, you have already put the Amendment, do not - otherwise, you are spoiling your Amendment.  Hon. Minister.

DR BACHOU:  Mr Chairman, the concern of hon. Wanendeya and other Members who in part supported his view, is already taken care of in this Bill, under clause 15 when we talk about management arrangements; clause 15 reads as follows:  “The Executive Director may with the approval of the Board enter into any suitable commercial or collaborative arrangements with any person for the management of a protected area or a portion of the protected area.”  Now, management entails receiving revenues, distribution of revenues and everything; it does.  Management involves that as well.  Now, clause 17 has got a specific objective, which does not include revenue sharing, whereas management arrangements can include revenue sharing arrangements.

AN HON. MEMBER:  Mr Chairman, may is not the same as mandatory;  what we are requesting this august House to help us is to make it mandatory that we share some of these fees.

MR NEKYON:  Point of information.  Mr Chairman, I would like to inform the House that I remember vaguely that when the Kabalega park was being established under the name of Murchison Falls Park, an agreement was signed between the government of Uganda and the Local Government of Bunyoro and Acholi, in which it was clearly provided that a specific percentage, I think it was either, ten or 20 per cent, but that can be checked in the files which would go to the local government.  The idea was that by the time the British came here all the land, all the animals, all the trees which constituted the area belong to Bunyoro and Acholi, because there was no Uganda at that time.  Even in the Constitution now we have transferred the land to be owned by the citizens.  

So, it is logical that we should specify in the law what percentage of the revenue collected from fees should go to the local governments.  When I was minister in charge of tourism I found that it was useful to involve the local governments because they were the people who, actually, managed to restrain the local people from poaching, otherwise, if you leave the work of restraining the people to the central government they will not manage, because they do not know who is poaching, who is hiding where, who is doing what.  So, I recommend that we specify a certain amount of money, maybe, 50 is too high, me I would go for 20 per cent and support it.

MR WANENDEYA:  Mr Chairman, I appreciate hon. Nekyon’s contribution who happens also to be brother in law.  Mr Chairman, considering the amount of wastage of money by some of our public servants, 30 per is reasonable as opposed to 20, and therefore, Mr Chairman, as a way of -(Interjections.)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  Order, hon. Members; the Amendment has been improved by hon. Nekyon, that instead of 50 per cent the House should think of approving 20 per cent.  Hon. Minister, what is your reaction?

DR BACHOU:  Mr Chairman, maybe, I should also give a similar reason that hon. Wanendeya gave, about hon. Nekyon, maybe, I should also call him a brother in law, and therefore, - I think, the principle involved, Mr Chairman; there is no denial that the principle hon. Members are concerned about here is acceptable to the Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities; I say that because, already as I have stated, we have already put this in practice.  However, I would like hon. Members to note the following fact, that the revival of the tourism sector still in its infancy, and if you are going to start with what is regarded as a sound, commercial and financial arrangement by allotting a higher percentage of revenues which are right now extremely constraint, we would be putting a lot of burden on the management of Uganda Wildlife authority.  I, therefore, suggest hon. Members, to accept to start with, the figure of ten per cent which we are right now already giving to the local communities on a revenue sharing basis.  I think ten per cent is a reasonable figure because we are talking of gross and not net.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  Order, order.  Hon. Members, I think, the Amendment now on the Floor is reads as follows:  “The Board shall pay 20 per cent of the revenue collected from fees.....”  I now put the question - yes, there is clarification from hon. Gad Gasatura.

CAPT. GASATURA:  Point of clarification.  Mr Chairman, I just wish to seek clarification from the Minister in view of his plea that the ten per cent is gross, whereas when we put 20 per cent, we are not considering the costs, or even receiving that 20 per cent, of collecting such fees.  Even collecting fee, Mr Chairman, there is a cost of officers and others -(Interruption).

MR OKWERA:  Point of order.  Mr Chairman, just a few minutes ago we have been threatened with the issue of lack of quorum, and now we have quorum, and is it in order now for hon. Capt. Gasatura to continue wasting our time on a matter where we have already got a general consensus.  Is he in order?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  I think, hon. Gasatura, was seeking clarification;  he wanted to make a decision when his mind was clear.  I think he was seeking clarification.  I think that point is raised enough, hon. Minister.

DR BACHOU:  Thank you, Mr Chairman, I appreciate the concern of hon. Gasatura; but I would rather not waste time going in the technical details of how this is arrived at, I would rather accept the figure of 20 per cent to receive popular acclaim.  Thank you very much.

MR OMARA ATUBO:  The principle I am going to put, Mr Chairman, will help the House, because I do not believe that you would like to come back to a Parliament to amend this percentage; for me my view is that we draft it in such a way that we give flexibility to wildlife authority and local councils, to negotiate.  Because you may find that one time in two, three, years the business is lucrative and they may wish 30 per cent or 40 per cent.  So, for purposes of drafting, Mr Chairman, if the Minister can agree, not less than would be the best way; not less than ten per cent.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  Hon. Members, order, order.  Even these laws you are making are subject to Amendment in future.  So, let us not waste a lot of time.  I now put the question that clause 71 be amended as proposed by hon. Wanendeya.

(Question put and agreed to.)
 
Clause 71 as amended, agreed to.

Clause 72

MR NKALUBO WASSWA:  Mr Chairman, clause 72 subsection 2, we say the Executive Director shall prepare estimates, because actually, it is mandatory that before any money is spent, this supplementary estimate has to be approved by the Board.  Instead of saying, ‘may’ we should say ‘shall prepare’.

MR ABU MAYANJA:  I think this one is correctly worded because they may not require supplementaries all the time.  When they require supplementaries, he prepares them; if they do not - but when you say shall, that means that he must always prepare supplementaries. 

Clause 72 agreed to.

Clause 73

MR NKALUBO WASSWA:  Mr Chairman, under clause 73.3 we are saying that the Board shall cause to be prepared as soon as possible, but not later than 30 days after the end of the financial year, an annual report.  I would suggest that it has to be three months; you cannot make final accounts within 30 days, that one is not possible.  Let us make it -

DR BACHOU:  It is in order, Mr Chairman.  I accept the Amendment.  Thank you very much; from 30 to 90 days.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  I now put the question that clause 73 be amended as proposed by hon. Wasswa Nkalubo.

(Question put and agreed to.)

MR WANENDEYA:  Mr Chairman, clause 73.2, it reads as follows:  “The accounts of the fund shall be audited by the Auditor General or an audit firm appointed by him in writing.”  Mr Chairman, the reason for proposing this is that in case the Auditor General is encumbered by a number of audits to be made, he could assign the auditing of the authority to another audit firm to do the auditing.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.

PROF. KANYEIHAMBA:  Point of information.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I would like to inform hon. Wanandeya through you, Mr Chairman, that really this is not necessary; the Constitution says books of government and institutions of this kind are to be audited by the Auditor General; and there is a general power that where he is to auditor them, he may assign someone else do it, including a firm you are suggesting.

Clause 73 agreed to.

Clause 74 agreed to.

Clause 75 agreed to.

Clause 76 agreed to.

Clause 77 agreed to.

Clause 78 agreed to.

Clause 79 agreed to.

Clause 80 agreed to.

Clause 84 agreed to.

Clause 90.

MR WANENDEYA:  Mr Chairman, I would beg and I propose that subclause 3 be added to the existing 2 to read as follows:  “If proved by court of law, the Executive Director or any other officer shall be personally liable for actions purportedly made in the interest of the board.”  Mr Chairman, the reason for proposing this is that invariably some of our public servants make decisions purportedly to be official but with selfish motives; and in the end they are dismissed when they are found that they did not make them in the best interest of the organisation.  Therefore, if somebody makes a decision purportedly under the best interests of the organisation but with personal motives, this should be included over here to catch anybody who would be taking wrong decisions which are supposed to be in the best interest of the organisation, and this would save the country on a number of funds which are misappropriated and the individual is just left scot free.  I beg to propose, Mr Chairman.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  But hon. Wanendeya, the Amendment you are proposing is contradicting sub-clause 2 above!

MR WANENDEYA:  No; Mr Chairman, clause 2 would stand as it is.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  But your proposed 3 contradicts directly 2 above.

MR WANENDEYA:  Mr Chairman, I have carefully considered this -(Interruption).

MR ONGOM:  Point of information.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I would like to ask my hon. Friend to withdraw his Amendment, because the word there ‘in good faith’ presupposes that if it is proved that the decision was not made in good faith then obviously some other things will be done.  But if it is in good faith then he should not be held liable for any wrong decision.  People can sometimes make wrong decisions;  but the point here is that it has got to be proved that he made it in good faith.  If he does not, then obviously this clause does not even apply.  Therefore, even what you are trying to introduce does not really matter.

DR BACHOU:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I think the words used by the hon. Member who has just spoken are the words that I would like to use.  If we are to include the Amendment suggested by hon. Wanendeya, we would simply be repeating subclause 2 and simply substituting the words ‘in good faith’ with the words ‘in bad faith’ so that the whole thing would be superfluous.  I do not accept the Amendment, Mr Chairman.  Thank you.

MR ABU MAYANJA:  Mr Chairman, I would like to know the rationale behind the provision of clause 1; this is a clause which says that no action for recovery of damages shall - for any damage done to person or property by animals.  Mr Chairman, supposing the director keeps a pet in the park and it injures me can I not sue the authority?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  You are taking us back, but I think there are two things;  you are wanting clarification on clause 1, but let us first of all deal with the Amendment and then we shall deal with that.  I now put the question that clause 90 be amended as proposed by hon. William Wanendeya.

(Question put and negatived.)

THE CHAIRMAN: Then there is a point of clarification sought by hon. Abu Mayanja.  Hon. Minister please.

DR BACHOU:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  In every national park there is always a warning sign to people who are there, including those who actually live there;  and that goes for many other places where you are told that you are doing certain things at your own risk.  That does not mean your life is at risk, it simply means that you aught to be careful when you are in the park, because of this provision, in case something wrong; and a pet is not regarded as a wildlife, a pet is a domesticated animal or bird, whatever;  and the story would be different because in that case, when it is domesticated then the owner would be responsible for any damage that the pet might cause to somebody there.

PROF. KANYEIHAMBA:  Point of information.  Mr Chairman, I believe that the question asked by hon. Abu Mayanja is valid, but if we look in section 2, the animal in the parks have been defined as wild animal, and therefore, instead of saying animal we would say wild animals, that will exclude domesticated animals which cause - so, I suggest that instead of saying animals, we should say any damage caused by a wild animal; because that is what is defined in the Act.  

MR ABU MAYANJA:  Mr Chairman, it is common knowledge that public highway go through national parks; now, whereas it is reasonable to say a man who is coming to view animal may be said to do so at his own risk, and that if the animal chooses to hurt him he should not recover damages; but supposing I am driving my car and then I am frightened by a tiger and I get a heart attack -

MRS KALEMA:  Mr Chairman, I would also like to be more clarified about the same subsection 91, and in particular I would like to know whether there can be a special provision for the members of staff of the wildlife and Uganda national parks; rangers and other members of staff, whether the ministry has got special protection for them if they were attacked and they were on duty.

MR MAYENGO:  Mr Chairman, let me add one more example to those possible cases where damage could be done, and which according to subclause 1 no action would lie.  Mr Chairman, if I cultivated a large shamba of, let us say cotton, outside the boundaries of national part, and all of a sudden a heard of elephants came around and eat up virtually all the cotton; do we include these as saying no action lie - is it not -(Interjections)- in the national park?  Then, Mr Chairman, the example hon. Abu Mayanja quite applies, if I am driving through and I get such a damage as he described, then who is responsible? I think the authority should be somehow responsible.

DR BACHOU:  Mr Chairman, here we are restricting ourselves within the preserves of the boundaries of the national park or the wildlife reserve, not outside the park.   In along the road that is more public, the conditions are not the same as within the national park; and the clarification sought by hon. Kanyeihamba where he talks about an Amendment to say that instead of animal we should talk about wild animal; this clause simply means we are talking about damage to an animal, like damage to a person.  So, the word animal is not necessarily the wild one, it is animals which are there within the park, not wild animals.  I think that clarifies the issues which were raised.  Thank you.

PROF. KANYEIHAMBA:  Point of clarification.  Mr Chairman, I think, I want to clarify because it seems the Minister misunderstood me.  Of course, it is damage caused to a person or to property, I have no quarrel with the word.  What where you are not liable is, it says caused by any animal; and following on hon. Abu Mayanja’s point, supposing an executive officer in the park is keeping a dog, or a cat, and that cat causes damage to me or causes damage to my property, then surely they should be liable, but where they are not liable if the causer of the damage to me or the person is a wild animal, that is why I was saying we should amend ‘any animal’ by saying any ‘wild animal’.  

DR BACHOU:  That much I thought I had already clarified when I talked about pets being animals for which their people are responsible; whereas wild animals are not.  So, I think, we can add the word ‘wild animal’.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.

MR ABU MAYANJA:  As a result of the Amendment which I accept –(Interruption)

DR BACHOU:  Is the hon. Member in order to presume that you wish him to speak, when actually we have seen that you have not asked him to speak?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  You know as a senior Member of this House I had the courtesy to allow him to continue. 

MR ABU MAYANJA:  Mr Chairman, if we are going to put there wild animal or what, there was a latin phrase used here in the definition of a wild animal, I do not know if it was explained to the House, it is on page 11 and it says a wild animal means any animal which is rerai naturai, but does not include any domestic animals.  Mr Chairman, lawyers know that animals are divided into two parts; they are either ferrai naturale or mansueta naturale. Now what is that we have put in the law, I think we should take this opportunity for the minister to tell us the meaning of -(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  Order, hon. Member, you are taking us backwards; the point you are raising is on page 11 and we went through page 11, but what you raising is an issue, except that you are taking us backwards. 

DR BACHOU:  I will note that, but I believe from that particular definition the distinction is quite clear between the rarai nationale and the one which is domestic animal; I think it is quite clear, but I will take note of the concern of the hon. Member.  Thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  I now put the question that clause 90 be amended as proposed by hon. Abu Mayanja.

(Question put and agreed to.)
 
Clause 90 as amended, agreed to.

Clause 91 agreed to.

Clause 92 agreed to.

Clause 93 agreed to.

Clause 94 agreed to.

Clause 95 agreed to.

Clause 96 agreed to.

The Schedule:  

DR YYEKO:  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman; on the Schedule under 3; that is on the meetings, the Schedule is not exhaustive on how the meetings shall be conducted.  For example, it does not state who chairs the meetings, and does not also state that in the absence of the Chairman who chairs.  So, I propose that we add a new clause under 3, which shall read:  “The Chairman shall chair all the meetings and in his absence a Chairman elected from the members present and forming a quorum, shall chair the meeting.  Clause 4 where it says that the minutes kept under subparagraph 3 shall be confirmed by the Board at the next meeting and signed by the Chairman of that meeting; that meeting which is stated there implies that there can be another Chairman other than the Chairman of the Board to chair meetings.  The other proposal is that -(Interjections)- okay;  so, I propose that we add a new clause which says that the Chairman shall chair all the meetings and in his absence a person elected from among the members present and forming a quorum shall chair the meeting.

DR BACHOU:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I am not a very particular person; when I see a word like, Chairman, in a subclause, automatically it means that is the person who will be chairing, in impressively it means that in his absence somebody else can chair, because if the meeting is to take place when there is a quorum anybody will chair.  So, for me I really do not see any particular need to have a special clause stating that when there is a meeting there will be a Chairman chairing that meeting.  It think it is really a redundant provision to my judgement.  So, I would like to seek the indulgence of the hon. Member to leave these subclauses under 3 as they are.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.

DR YYEKO:  But, I think, it is important to state, Mr Chairman, that in the absence of, for example, the Chairman someone has to be elected to chair the meeting.  It should not be taken for granted.  

PROF. KANYEIHAMBA:  Mr Chairman, on that if we have to make an Amendment it should be in the main body of the Statute, for example, under clause 8, where it says the governing body of the authority shall be the board of trustees, and then clause 2, the Chairman or any member of the Board other than the executive director, it moves into the Chairman, without actually, having created that office.  I think, if there is an Amendment it should be under clause 8 that there shall be a Chairman of the Board who shall preside over the meetings.  This is a substantive provision and should not be in the Schedule.  My only view is that, Mr Chairman, to save time, I am sure the draftsman is in the lobby hearing what we are saying, they could adjust it under Article 8 to ensure that this board is chaired by a person called Chairman and then they can spell out his functions there in accordance with the Bill, Mr Chairman.

DR BACHOU:  I think I accept the suggestion of hon. Kanyeihamba.  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  Your Amendment will be taken care of by the draftsman, who will put it in the main body, under clause 8.

DR MAGEZI:  Mr Chairman, I seek clarification from the Minister of Justice on this matter, whether the counsel can insert clauses in the State which have not been passed by the House, Mr Chairman?

MR EKEMU:  Mr Chairman, I do not know what hon. Magezi wants, but I think it has been agreed that - it is not a clause, actually, any more, because this is now a section of the Statute; but what is talked about here is the mere chairing; and for, Mr Chairman, it is even different because the fact the Chairman’s position is mentioned in the Schedule is enough, it is understood and it is very clear that the Chairman’s work is to chair the meeting, apart from other things. 

MR ONGOM:  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  There is a point about which I am not clear on the Schedule No.1 (a) (i) -(Interruption)

PROF. KANYEIHAMBA:  Point of procedure.  Mr Chairman, the hon. Member who moved this Amendment of the Chairman, had said he had another point on the same matter, and you had given him the Floor to continue with that one; even for myself I have some Amendments to make but I gave way to him.  So, I assume as a matter of procedure, hon. Ongom should wait until the Member has finished his point.

DR YYEKO:  The second thing is on the quorum;  in the schedule here it is stated that the quorum should be five, under section 4;  but if you are going to have a membership of 15, I think, five is too small.  So, I think, the quorum should be increased to seven or eight other than five.

REV. ONGORA ATWAI:  Mr Chairman, it is true that if you are Member of a sectoral committee, on arrival in the august House you can change your mind.  When we were going through this very area, the hon. Member moving it now was satisfied that five would be a third, and I do not know whether he has given it a second thought.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  Order, hon. Members, let us proceed; some of these matters are not very crucial.  May I take it that hon. Yyeko has withdrawn;  okay. 

AN HON. MEMBER: I just wanted clarification on Schedule No.1 (a)(i) where it says; not more than 15 members to be drawn from the following sections; then (1) says, five representatives of the local communities residing in areas with wildlife.  Now, I am not quite sure what that means; residing with wildlife?

DR BACHOU:  I think what is stated here is quite clear that there are people who are residing in areas which have wildlife.  So, it is the areas with wildlife, and it is not the people with wildlife.  I think, it is quite clear there.

PROF. KANYEIHAMBA:  Mr Chairman, in the Schedule on clause 1(a) I want to propose an Amendment that instead of using the words ‘to be drawn from the following’ it should be ‘to be appointed’ member of the Board are appointed not drawn, only cheques are drawn.  Mr Chairman, if we look at clause 8 it talks about the Board being appointed by the Minister, and therefore, the Schedule would be in conformity with provisions of the section itself.  So, I move that we say appointed, also that applies to 1(b) where it says the following ex-official members be drawn; it should be shall be appointed.

MR BACHOU:  Thank you, Mr Chairman, I accept the Amendment;  thank you.

CAPT. GASATURA:  Mr Chairman, just at the beginning, the Board may consist of; I thought it should be more emphatic and be shall consist of, so that we are specific. 

DR BACHOU:  Thank you, Mr Chairman, that is in order; thank you.  

MR WANENDEYA:  Mr Chairman, on page 76, No.2 of the Schedule; Mr Chairman, subclause 2, says that the Board - that line No.5, the word, ‘instead of has passed’ should be ‘lapsed’.  Secondly, Mr Chairman, under subsection 2, on line 1, it should be one in bracket (a) because this is what it is in number one.  I hope the Minister is getting me.  Then thirdly, on page 76, No.3, the word ‘broad’ should not be broad but ‘board’ and should read board as specified.  The same thing applies to 3.2; it should be again board instead of broad.

DR BACHOU:  Thank you, Mr Chairman, the last two were actually spelling errors and the hon. Members knows very well that it is meant to be board.  But I thank him for bringing it to our attention.  Regarding the word passed or elapsed, I really do not see the difference; a period of two years has elapsed, or a period of two years has passed.  For me I think in common parlance with the general population, passed is more appropriate and more commonly used than elapsed.  So, I would like to stick to the word passed.

PROF. KANYEIHAMBA:  Thank you, Mr Chairman, clause 5 of the schedule where a member of the Board who has a direct or indirect person, Mr Chairman, with your permission I wish the Minister to accept that we delete ‘has a direct or indirect’  because the usual formulation is who has a personal interest.  Once you say indirect that puts you in all sorts of blames, how indirect is it, how far must you go and, therefore, the words we always use are that a board who has a personal interest and we do not qualify it.  That is up to the Board after he has disclosed it to know whether he or she should be excluded from the meeting concern.  So, I move that we delete a direct or indirect, so it remains has personal interest.

DR BACHOU:  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman.  I think that Amendment is quite acceptable to us and I accept it.  Thank you.

CAPT. GASATURA:  Just a clarification, Mr Chairman, on section 4 subsection 4, the Board may co-opt a person to attend its meeting and a person so co-opted shall participate under deliberations and so forth.  I am wondering about the shall, if he does not come and does not participate, is that an offence?  I imagine they intended to allow such a co-opted person to participate but not to vote.  Could we have this as a may participate but shall have no right to vote.

DR BACHOU:  I think, the word ‘may’ puts it in better perspective, and therefore, that is acceptable.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN:  I think we have now considered all the possible Amendments.  I now put the question that the Schedule be amended as proposed by various members and accepted by the Minister.

(Question put and agreed to.)


The Schedule as amended agreed to.

The Title agreed to.
