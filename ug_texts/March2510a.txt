COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Adison Kakuru, I welcome you to the Eighth Parliament and congratulate you upon your election. I understand that you are a member of the National Resistance Movement Party; so you will be sitting on this side of the House. But on this side of the House are the Members of the other parties who you are going to work with during your term of office.

I am sure that the Chief Whip will assign you one Standing Committee and one Sessional Committee where you will serve for the rest of your term. And I will take this opportunity to hand over to you the instruments of office that you are going to use: this is the Uganda Constitution, which you have used to take the oaths, please uphold it. And these are the Rules of Procedure, please study them; they will guide you both in the plenary and in the committee work. You are welcome. (Applause)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Members, we have two functions today; what we have just concluded is our ordinary session of Parliament but we shall now adjourn to 11.30 for the Special Session of Parliament where we shall receive President Zuma. 

I want to thank you for coming early, please remain here, and I hope that those seats will be full by 11.30 when our guest arrives. The House adjourned to 11.30. (Laughter)

(The House rose at 10.43 a.m. and adjourned until Thursday, 25 March 2010 at 11.30 a.m.)
