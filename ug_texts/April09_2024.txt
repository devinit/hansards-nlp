PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES(HANSARD)OFFICIAL REPORTTHIRD SESSION - THIRD MEETINGTUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA12389Tuesday, 9 April 2024Let us not only make Bills that help us in this House; you should have public consultation so that we do not get problems like the ones we are getting right now. Let us hear from people on what they think about these Bills. For instance, somebody came and told me; just imagine they want to tax a purchase of land or sale of land. Assuming you are a civil servant and you have got that money out of what you are doing, that has already been taxed. For you to transfer the land that you are buying, you must pay a tax. When you sell that land, you pay again. That is triple taxation, so we need to understand and consult the stakeholders to this effect so that we make laws and levy taxes that favour the country. I urge the Attorney-General to be considerate when doing all these things. Honourable members, that must be done. I want to see adverts on public consultations on the taxes that we are going to pass running. (Applause)Honourable members, I am aware that tomorrow may be Eid al-Fitr. You never know; you leave only us who are Muslims to speak. (Laughter)  I take this opportunity to wish our Muslim brothers and sisters a happy Eid and may Allah’s blessings illuminate all your paths of joy and happiness and fulfil all that you have been praying for. I know Hon. Allan has been praying for something. On a rather sad note, we received information this afternoon about the unfortunate demise of the retired Col. Nelson Obiale. The retired IN THE PARLIAMENT OF UGANDAOfficial Report of the Proceedings of ParliamentTHIRD SESSION - 22ND SITTING - THIRD MEETING Parliament met at 2.00 p.m. in the Parliament House, Kampala.PRAYERS(The Speaker, Ms Anita Among, in the Chair.)The House was called to order.COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIRTHE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, I welcome you to this afternoon’s sitting. I also put it on record that we will be sitting on Thursday and Friday to consider the RAPEX Bills. It is not a usual thing that we sit on a Friday, but because of pressure from your Government Chief Whip, we need the RAPEX Bills. I am also aware that most of the Bills are ready, so we should be sitting to make sure that we finish. I understand why they want the RAPEX Bills because we are doing budgeting and some of these institutions are not getting money. So, I think they want to get them out of the way, so we will sit and consider that. Honourable members, we shall also be sitting next week to consider the Tax Bills, after the RAPEX Bills. The Tax Bills were laid on the Table and are being considered, but I urge the Chairperson of the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development that as you consider these Bills, you should be able to get the stakeholders and consult them on these Bills. 12390MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION [The Speaker]colonel was a father to Hon. Lillian Obiale, Arua District Woman MP, and the burial is slated for 13 April 2024 in Arua. We condole with the family and for those who are willing to go to Arua, we will provide transport to the burial. Honourable members, please support our colleague who has lost a parent, and may the soul of Nelson rest in eternal peace. Honourable members, you will allow me to amend the Order Paper to include the re-designation of Members and the first reading of some RAPEX Bills. We had some, but we added other Bills, so I am amending the Order Paper to that effect. Thank you so much for coming. Yes, Hon. Meddie? Hon. Patrick, congratulations, you won in PAC. 2.07MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO (Indepen -dent, Kampala Central Division, Kampala City):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I bring it to your attention that the Central Business Dis -trict (CBD), which I represent in this Parlia -ment, has been undergoing a sit-down strike by traders. The business persons of this country who contribute a lot in the form of taxes and the development of our nation are hurt and the reason is exactly what you said through your communication. One, the high-handed methods used by the Uganda Revenue Authority in execution of its cardinal statutory duties of collecting taxes, but also our being inconsiderate in passing taxes in this august House. There is a reason as to why people are angry towards the political class that they think is inconsiderate of their sweat and desires, and being the roadblock towards their quest for success in business. The reasons for their closure this time are very clear. One, the introduction of the Electronic Fiscal Receipting and Invoicing Solution (EFRIS) without proper awareness and technical advice, what you have been hearing being called EFRIS. This states that each wholesaler downtown must purchase a point-of-sale (POS) machine and must have the technical ability to operate it, mount it and connect it to the portal, and for every transaction they conduct, there must be a loop between them and the Uganda Revenue Authority. We are not saying, no. We are talking about the canon of ploughing taxes and taxation, which is a certainty. When I set up a business, I must be certain of the taxes that I am going to encounter. That is one, but also, the proper system of ploughing them from society. These people do not have the technical ability. That is number one. Two, they have not been educated on the use of EFRIS. Also, it is uncertain that when it comes at such a time when they need to invest – they are running on loans - it is choking to them. Secondly, the traders are saying that when they go to import goods from abroad, they must be certain of the taxes that have been captured in the tax codes by Parliament. However, someone goes and procures goods, and when they arrive, they are asked to pay a certain value. After that, there is a second evaluation. They tell them, “You have to pay for a top-up.” This issue of top-up is creating confusion. Even after paying for a top-up –THE SPEAKER:  Is the top-up outside what was approved by this House? MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO:  Yes, absolutely. It is at the discretion of a customs officer – (Interjections)THE SPEAKER:  There is information from a committee chairperson. MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO:  Can I first finish?THE SPEAKER:  No, get the information. MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO:  All right, I will take it.MR KANKUNDA:  Thank you, my honourable colleague, for giving way. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I think the matter that my colleague is talking about holds water, but we need to avoid cutting across administrative issues. We know COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR12391THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024for a fact that our own taxpayers sometimes under-declare values so it is not right for us to make a sweeping statement that they ask for top-up. Top-up is the result of finding out that there was an under-declaration of value. If it can be justified that there is an under-declaration of value at the declaration –(Interjection)-  no, wait. Madam Speaker, the point I am trying to drive is that it is not right for us to make a sweeping statement that there is a top-up. If a top-up is not justifiable, that is right. Otherwise, there is no problem and it is not outside the law. That is the information I wanted to share. THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. Hon. Nsereko, I know you are still continuing, but when you say the House is inconsiderate in legislation, it is the reason I have emphasised the need for public hearing to ensure that the legislation reflects what is outside there. EFRIS is not a tax. It is a system of tax collection and that is tax administration. We do not do tax administration here. We pass a tax and administration is the role of the Executive. Therefore, you need to be specific that much as we pass the taxes, the persons who are responsible for administration should also do it in a way that is considerate to the people outside there.MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. THE SPEAKER:  There is a procedural matter.MR ENOS ASIIMWE:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. Rule 80 is very clear; we should not debate in anticipation. You designated next week to deal with tax Bills. Why would we open the debate now? Thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, we are not debating tax, which we have not passed. The concern of Hon. Nsereko is the demonstration that is downtown – (Applause) – my only - if you want to talk, I will give you the microphone. We are here to solve people’s problems. If you all want to make noise here - Yes, Hon. Felix?MR OKOT-OGONG:  Madam Speaker, the matter being raised by Hon.  Nsereko is –THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Nsereko is on procedure. You are still coming back?MR OKOT-OGONG:  He is raising that issue on behalf of the traders, not only in Kampala, but all over the country. I would advise him to come in a proper way by presenting a petition from the traders. When this petition is presented, it is referred to the appropriate committee. That is when we will have a public hearing. We will invite all the stakeholders –THE SPEAKER : That is committees for finance and trade. MR OKOT-OGONG:  I would advise him to come up with a proper petition signed by the traders and the matter be referred to the committee. That is where we are going to interrogate the matter by inviting all the stakeholders. I think that would be the proper way to enable us to debate this concern because we cannot debate it on the Floor of Parliament.THE SPEAKER : Honourable members, I want to tell you that it is not only happening in Kampala; it is everywhere. What Hon. Nsereko is raising is so important that it should not only stop here. This must be interrogated and we must come to a solution. The Committee on Tourism, Trade and Industry and the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development must hold a public hearing with these traders. Can you conclude?MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO:  Madam Speaker, I would like to allay the fears of some of my colleagues like the chairperson of the finance committee. When I talked about certainty in administration - This is the temple of presentation of people’s issues. There is no reason as to why you should say, we cannot discuss an issue of enforcement. We can. I am trying to tell you how to plough taxes. The reason is that enforcement is where you get uncertainty. That is why the Rt Hon. Speaker was talking about triple, double and whatever taxation. 12392MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONTHE SPEAKER:  That is why I was telling you that you are insincere when you say we are inconsiderate. We do not do tax administration. Ours is to urge URA to do what is right. MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO:  Madam Speaker, I will take your guidance. Besides, let me make this clear –THE SPEAKER:  Let us not take a lot of time on that; it is a serious matter and URA must come out. Committees for finance and trade, take it up and ensure that there is certainty in the collection of these taxes.MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO:  Madam Speaker, as I wind up, we are talking about over 200,000 people closing business and for every day that they close business, there is a shortfall in tax collection. If we sit here and just wish it away – I am not saying, we are wishing it away as a House. When we come out to debate their plight, like you have guided, I would request that you give me time to complete the three issues. These can be captured and referred to the relevant committees or within the wisdom of the House, they get their own referrals.You have talked about double taxation and an uncertain – (Interruption)MS MALENDE:  Thank you, honourable colleague, for giving way. Additionally, Madam Speaker, as we speak, there is a lot of military and security deployment in the business centres around Kikuubo, Nasser Road and Nakasero. This is terrorising the customers and scaring them away. The business community –THE SPEAKER:  Where is the evidence? At least, I have seen the shops closed.MS MALENDE:  Yes, the shops are closed.THE SPEAKER:  But where is the evidence of military deployment?MS MALENDE:  Madam Speaker, it is everywhere. Even on my phone, I can show you - (Laughter)  So we pray that -THE SPEAKER:  We need to clarify that. We have army officers here. Can I hear from –MS MALENDE:  Madam Speaker, they cannot defend their – because they know that the military is down there. THE SPEAKER:  Maybe it is for safety.MS MALENDE:  Madam Speaker, it is terrorising and scaring away the customers. This is very important because the business community has complained about it. THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, first of all, I would like to thank one Member for being available in this House. When we were vetting him, I gave him marching orders that he must be in the House every day. Hon. Balaam, thank you for being in the House. (Applause) That was one of the – yes, Hon. Eddie, can you finish?MR NSEREKO:  Madam Speaker, as we wind up, the matters are three: one, if the usage of that digital and e-receipt without offering technical assistance discourages traders from further investing in their businesses, it will have a backlash. Secondly, the uncertain taxation and the high-handed methods of ploughing this tax – I was talking about the top-up and after the top-up, when the traders present their goods in the shops, they are again stopped and asked to pay another tax in the form of another top-up. We have to talk about that. Finally, the issue of the landlords – THE SPEAKER:  Are you saying uncertain taxation?MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO:  Yes. THE SPEAKER:  What does uncertain taxation mean? MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO:  Uncertain taxes are, for example, if I give you my bill of lading, it will show the values of what I have COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR12393THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024imported. These values are already captured in the taxes that we have passed. Tax me once. If you tax me and then you go ahead –THE SPEAKER:  It should be double taxation and not uncertain taxation.MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO:  No, I am talking about the canons of taxation. One, there is uncertainty - and I am telling you the reality. Any other person who wants to debate the matter can also debate it.THE SPEAKER:  You finish.MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO:  Therefore, when I am certain of the tax I am going to pay, for example, if I imported a car – THE SPEAKER:  Let us first hear from an accountant.MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO:  Madam Speaker, I think I should wind up my discussion here. THE SPEAKER:  No, it will help us on that point. MR WANDA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, and Hon. Nsereko, for giving way. The Uganda Revenue Authority is mandated to administer taxes. However, in that process, they conduct research and also link up with the suppliers. Sometimes, they discover that traders have not brought the actual invoices, but provided forged invoices. Therefore, in liaison with the suppliers, when they confirm that there is such an incident, they have no option, but to adjust the prices or costs that the traders –THE SPEAKER:  Where there is under declaration.MR WANDA:  Yes. It is actually not an uncertain tax, but tax based on facts and research. Thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, what we are doing is getting information to form what we are going to discuss.MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO:  Madam Speaker, it is very absurd. What I am talking about - If given a chance in the future, I would like to bring evidence to dispute his facts. The reason is very clear; companies in some parts of the world issue e-receipts. For example, if I bought a car at US$ 10,000 from a given seller, and a receipt has been issued to me, where does URA get the mandate to dispute my figure –(Interjection)  - no, I am giving you the reality.Two, if I am a trader, for example, importing garments, I negotiate with the manufacturer and they give me a certain price or if the prices have dropped from the point of the manufacturer, but you appear before URA and URA says, for us the price we know is for January 2021.Madam Speaker, we may shy away from this, but there will reach a moment when there is no one to speak for these people and they will come like the sweepers and speak for themselves.THE SPEAKER:  Can I hear from Hon. Kateshumbwa.  He is a businessman and he will tell you that – Hon. Balaam, let me first –(Laughter)MR KATESHUMBWA:  Madam Speaker, tax is a matter of law. We should distinguish tax from administration. There is no uncertainty as far as tax rates are concerned. This House passes the rates and some of the laws and guidelines that they are using are international. For example, if we talk about the definition of value, the general agreement on tariffs and trade that gives rise to the harmonised code are all international. Therefore, the issue should not be that Parliament is inconsiderate, but we pass the laws in this House. The issue of administration is where the Member is raising concerns. Madam Speaker, you have guided and we need to listen to all the parties, and not debate with a lot of emotions and information that might be misleading. If it is an issue of valuation, it is provided for under the General Agreement on Tariffs and 12394MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION [Mr Kateshumbwa]Trade (GATT) and the Harmonised Code. If people are applying it wrongly, we can listen and understand so as to guide our administrators to say, “Here you are overtaxing people and overvaluing goods”. But you should not debate without information. I concur with you, Madam Speaker, that we follow your guidance and allow us to listen to the people together with the administrators so that we can be able to guide. I submit. THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. LOP has something to say. 2.28THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (Mr Joel Ssenyonyi): Thank you, Madam Speaker. In your communication, you emphasised that as the committee is processing the Tax Bills, adequate time needs to be allocated to all the stakeholders and that is important. This morning, I received a delegation of traders –THE SPEAKER:  One minute. As we give them adequate time, we also have statutory deadlines. MR SSENYONYI:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. Certainly, we must work within the law as we avail ample time to the stakeholders to share their concerns. This morning, I received a delegation of traders under their umbrella organisation, Kampala City Traders Association headed by their chairperson. One of the concerns that they raised was that in the past, they have not had a chance to have an input when new taxes are proposed. So, they are looking forward to an interaction so that they can share their thoughts and not just to grumble after taxes have been passed and they struggle with them.The other concern was about the Electronic Fiscal Receipting and Invoicing Solutions (EFRIS), which we are talking about. The traders are saying that they are happy to pay taxes, but there is a challenge with this system. Uganda Revenue Authority has got -THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Ssenyonyi, I do not agree with you when they say that they have not had a chance in the past. The adverts in the Newspapers, Television and everywhere are run by the Office of the Clerk inviting them to come and give their contribution towards taxes. Hon. Musasizi -MR SSENYONYI:  I agree with you, Madam Speaker, that there is no need for the information. We need to avail ample time, as you had mentioned in your communication and there is no need for back and forth exchanges with the honourable minister. We are all in agreement, but on this issue of EFRIS, they are saying that URA has not taken off adequate time to sensitise them enough to come on board.There are many challenges:1. They need to have smart phones which a couple of them do not have.2. They also do not have internet to be able to interact with this system and so they are having run–ins with URA because they are not yet on the same page.One of the cardinal principals in taxation is that you have got to make it easy and clear for people to pay taxes otherwise, people are going to evade taxes and say, “I am giving my money, but I am also struggling with your system.” So, the comfortable and convenient thing for them to do is to evade taxes and yet we do not want that to happen. We would like to implore URA to take off time and interact with these traders because they are saying that they need to engage with you, have a good understanding, and get to share their concerns because they are grappling with many challenges which they have shared with us, but URA meets them once in a long time. They are saying, “Please make time”.Honourable Minister of Finance, please encourage URA which you supervise - These traders are saying, “We are here”. They have no objection to paying taxes because they want to benefit from service delivery as well, but COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR12395THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024they are saying, engage them and listen to their challenges because they are struggling. No wonder they are now closing their shops and protesting because they are not being listened to. Can we give them a platform to be heard?THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Ssenyonyi, maybe just for your information, there is going to be a meeting between URA, the traders and His Excellency the President of the Republic of Uganda to resolve those issues. Our interest is to have taxes collected and not evaded. Once that meeting takes place, I believe that everything will be resolved.MR SSENYONYI:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I am glad that the Government is listening to that clarion call because we should not wait for traders to protest and close shop. I do not know what else will happen before we can engage them. Let us not put the “cart before the horse.”THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Kateshumbwa, what is the Competition Bill? MR KATESHUMBWA:  Madam Speaker, I think the issues are very many. One, there are issues around how we are managing the Import Substitution Policy. Two, there are issues around the Competition Bill, which we passed here stating that if one is a manufacturer, do they go down to have their own retail shop, become a distributor and you edge out other people in the business?The best thing is to look at these issues jointly with the Committee on Tourism, Trade and Industry  and the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development  and look at the environment. If we are saying that the reasons why some of the taxes are high is to protect the local industries, have the local industries developed the capacity to be able to sufficiently provide the demand or we need to create a balance?So, we need to look at all these issues, examine them and come out with serious policy guidance so as to avoid - Otherwise, having a strike in the city is not good because it leads to revenue loss every day that the strike is on. It is not desirable. The best thing is to figure out how we can quickly work with the Government to listen to them and avoid a situation like this from happening again.THE SPEAKER:  Yes, finance.2.34THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi): Thank you, Madam Speaker. It is true that we have experienced a challenge with the traders in Kikuubo and yesterday, they staged a strike. Today, we received reports that some have started opening their shops. I wish to inform Parliament that there are three issues under contention. The main one concerning URA is EFRIS, taxation of textiles by weight which the traders are objecting and there is a concern about the chain of distribution in that some of the manufacturers have become wholesalers, retailers, hawkers, etcetera - basically the whole chain. While I listened to Hon. Nsereko and the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, they mentioned “lack of sensitisation.” I wish to inform this House that ever since EFRIS was launched in 2019 and subsequently we underwent full implementation after COVID-19, URA has visited over 20,000 traders in the Kampala Central Business district with sensitisation, installation and everything. They also mentioned that if the app or the phone is not available, we have got three options. You can have an EFRIS machine installed in your shop, you can have an app or even install the system on your computer in the shop. 12396MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION [Mr Musasizi]Lastly, and this is my prayer to the House, we must help URA and the Government to raise the revenue by – (Interjection)  Clarification is -THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Nsereko -MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO:  He has yielded the Floor; I did not force him. Thank you, my good friend, Hon. Musasizi. The matters you have noted are worth talking about and we have been with you previously, as the Chairperson of the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development . You remember that we had a long debate on the taxation of garments based on weight, but there was resistance from the side of the Executive and the repercussions are clearly seen, three to four years down the road. Secondly, you are talking about the administration using EFRIS. I agree with you, but does it attract no single fee? Don’t they need the technical assistance that they are talking about in order to be on the same page and who is to provide that? If you have those answers, come back with a comprehensive statement, maybe this week because we will continue closing our shops until we have a serious answer -THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, based on rule 87, I had already made a ruling that the Committees on Finance and Trade will meet with the stakeholders who are the traders, and report back to this House on Tuesday. Let us have the next item.DESIGNATION OF MEMBERS TO COMMITTEESTHE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, we have new colleagues who need to be designated as well as re-designating some of the old members from one committee to others.

DR RUTAHIGWA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, you will recall that on 27 February 2024, the Executive withdrew the Bills on rationalisation and the merging of public entities pending harmonisation as per the concerns of the Members. Last week, some Bills were re-introduced and today, another lot of Bills is being reintroduced for the First Reading. Therefore, pursuant to Rule 128(1) of the Rules of Procedure, I will invite the various ministers to lay the Bills on the Table. Remember that when the Bills were presented in the House, they went to different committees and I am aware that these committees have looked at them. What was lacking was making sure that these Bills were not brought omnibus. They were to be brought one by one, plus their Certificate of Financial Implication, which is being laid now. Therefore, pursuant to that rule, the sectoral committees are supposed to embark on these Bills and report back. We have Bills, which are ready to that effect.

Honourable members, we passed a budget in this House and that money has helped the districts. Each district and/or city was to get Shs 1 billion. Can we find out from the Ministry of Works and Transport whether that money has gone to the constituencies? Much as you want to make amendments, we want our Shs 1 billion. Can we have the money that is supposed to be in the districts for working on the roads? MR BYAMUKAMA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. Since the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development is here and is responsible for disbursing that money, he would be in the right position to give us the best assurance concerning the Shs 1 billion. THE SPEAKER:  Minister of Works, much as finance is here, it is works that is supposed to ask for the money.

The arrangement was that every quarter, we release Shs 250 million directly to the district. We managed to achieve this in quarter one and quarter two. In quarter three, because of the cash flow challenges, we were not able to send the Shs 250 million. We are doing everything possible to ensure that in this last quarter four, we send the full balance of Shs 500 million. Thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Honourable minister, when you are sending the Shs 500 million, kindly give me evidence of the money going to the districts and then I will lay it on the Table. MR MUSASIZI:  Much obliged, Madam Speaker. We shall provide – (Members rose_)THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, you know my principles; I do not like noise making.

Next item.MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT TO DETERMINE THE POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS OF THE AUDITOR-GENERAL, UNDER SECTION 5(2) OF THE NATIONAL AUDIT ACT, 2008THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, Section 5(2) of the National Audit Act, 2008 prescribes that: “The remuneration and other conditions of service of the Auditor-General, including the post-retirement benefits, shall be determined by Parliament.”  It is against that premise that the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development will seek to move a motion to that effect. As you are aware, the current Auditor-General has had an illustrious career, from 2001 to date. His tenure has witnessed a number of issues, including the growth of external audit functions across the Government. It is only befitting that this Parliament pronounces itself on the reward that must go with the Auditor-General. We are not only talking about the current Auditor-General, but the Auditors-General that will be in place. It is by law that we pronounce ourselves. We may not tell you why we are doing this now, but we need to pass it. I now invite the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development.The Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development is moving this motion because it has an effect on the Consolidated Fund, since money is going to be spent to that effect. 3.40THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE, PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GENERAL DUTIES) (Mr Henry Musasizi): Madam Speaker, I beg to move a motion for a resolution of Parliament of the Republic of Uganda to determine the post-retirement benefits of the Auditor-General, under Section 5(2) of the National Audit Act, 2008. This motion is moved in accordance with rule 156 of our Rules of Procedure.“WHEREAS Article 163(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda provides for an Auditor-General appointed by the President, with the approval of Parliament and whose office shall be a public office; AND WHEREAS the Parliament of the Republic of Uganda enacted the National Audit Act, 2008 to give effect to Article 163 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda and also facilitate the Auditor-General to independently execute the mandate of the Office of the Auditor General;AWARE that under section 5(1) of the National Audit Act, the Auditor-General may retire after attaining the age of 60 years and shall vacate office on attaining the age of 70 years; FURTHER AWARE that under Section 5(2) of the National Audit Act, the remuneration and other conditions of service of the Auditor-General, including post-retirement benefits, shall be determined by Parliament; 12408MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONNOW, THEREFORE, be it resolved by this Parliament that:1. The Auditor-General shall, on retirement from office, be granted the following benefits: a. A monthly retirement benefit equivalent to the salary payable to a sitting Auditor-General. The retirement benefit shall be paid to the retired Auditor-General for life;b. A furnished house or a one-off payment of twenty thousand currency points payable in lieu of the house;c. An annual medical allowance equivalent to the medical allowance payable to a sitting Auditor-General;d. A chauffeur driven car or a one-off  payment of twenty thousand currency points payable in lieu of the car;e. Security provided by the State;f. A fuel and vehicle repairs allowance of one hundred currency points per month;g. An official burial by the State upon death .”I beg to move, Madam Speaker.THE SPEAKER: Thank you very much. Is the motion seconded? It is seconded by Hon. Amos, Hon. Akol, Hon. Ojok, Hon. Koluo, Member formerly with Uganda Exports Promotions Board, Member from Kazo, Member from Kanungu, Hon. Herbert, Hon. Noah, Hon. Jane Bainomugisha, Hon. Wilson Kajwengye, Hon. Esenu, Hon. Mbabazi, Hon. Loy Katali, Member from Nakasongola, Hon. Helen, Hon Bwiire, Attorney-General and Gen. Kavuma. By the way, Hon. Gen. Kavuma, congratulations upon your promotion. (Applause)  It is seconded by the whole House. I also see Hon. Amero. Would you like to justify your motion?MR MUSASIZI: Thank you, Madam Speaker. The Parliament of Uganda, in 2008, in exercise of its legislative mandate, chose to breathe life in the provision of Article 163 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda by enacting an enabling law entitled “The National Audit Act, 2008”. The National Audit Act is aimed at strengthening the Office of the Auditor-General in execution of its mandate by providing for the appointment, tenure and removal of the Auditor-General; providing for the staff of the Office of the Auditor-General; providing for the auditing of accounts of Central Government, local government councils, administrative units, public organisations, private organisations and bodies; empowering and giving the Auditor-General right of access to documents and information relevant to the performance of his or her functions; and for other related matters. It is no secret that by the time of enactment of the National Audit Act, this country had lost a good professional in the person of the current Auditor-General, who had left in 2005 for the United States because he did not agree with the terms of service of the office. After failing to get a replacement, he was convinced to return to the office after enactment of the National Audit Act and restructuring of the office.Madam Speaker, however, in so doing, it reserved the right and authority in Section 5(2) to determine the remuneration and other conditions of service of the Auditor-General, including post-retirement benefits. Fourteen years down the road, Parliament has not yet executed this statutory mandate. In Uganda today, many institutions are struggling to retain talented employees and yet loyal employees are essential for long-term business success and stability. On this premise, when you find competent, talented employees, you want to do everything in your power to keep them. Retaining the most productive personnel is easier said than done and yet attraction is very expensive for all organisations. This is why Section 5(2) of the National Audit Act was enacted. In supporting this motion, I have the following reasons: [Mr Musasizi]12409THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024i) Attracting and retaining talent: offering competitive retirement benefits attracts experienced professionals to the role and encourages them to stay long enough to make meaningful contributions;ii) Motivation and job satisfaction. Knowing that they will be taken care of financially after retirement can enhance job satisfaction and motivation, leading to better performance and dedication to their duties;iii) Reducing turnover. Generous retirement benefits can reduce turnover rates, which is beneficial for continuity, institutional memory and maintaining integrity and effectiveness of the audit process;iv) Ensuring independence. Adequate retire -ment benefits can help ensure the inde -pendence of the Auditor-General by mit -igating concerns about post-retirement financial stability and reducing the poten -tial of undue influence from external par -ties; andv) Public confidence. Providing good retire -ment benefits demonstrates a commitment to valuing the important work done by the Auditor-General and can enhance public confidence in the integrity of the auditing process.Overall, investing in the retirement benefits of the Auditor-General is an investment in the effectiveness, integrity and stability of the auditing function in government. It is on this basis that I support the motion for the resolution of the Parliament of the Republic of Uganda stipulating the retirement benefits of the Auditor-General of Uganda. I beg to submit. THE SPEAKER: Thank you, honourable minister. The seconder, Hon. Amos Kankunda - 3.50MR AMOS KANKUNDA (NRM, Rwampara County, Rwampara): Madam Speaker, in my capacity as the Chairperson of the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development, I second the resolution of Parliament to move under Article 163(17) Clause 17 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995 and Section 5(2) of the National Audit Act providing for determination of post-retirement benefits of the Auditor General. Following the second amendment of, the Constitution (Amendment) Act, 2005, Act No. 11 of 2005, the independence, benefits and allowances of the Auditor-General were well defined in a number of constitutional provisions under Article 163, empowering Parliament to determine such benefits and allowances as deemed necessary for the performance of the functions of the Auditor-General. In that vein, the National Audit Act was enacted and gave effect to Article 154(3) and 163 of the Constitution, Section 5(2) expressly provides for the remuneration and other conditions of service of the Auditor-General including post-retirement benefits to be determined by the Parliament. However, the quantification of the post-retirement benefits is not specific in the Act. Alive to the above, the sitting Auditor-General, having served diligently for over 20 years, is due for retirement in the short term. However, his post-retirement benefits have not been clearly delineated in the law, much as Parliament has been empowered to do so, by resolution or otherwise. This is more than 16 years overdue Madam Speaker, based on the above, I therefore second the motion by the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic and Economic Development for a resolution for the post-retirement benefits of the Auditor-General to be clearly established and determined. I beg to move. THE SPEAKER: Thank you. Hon. Nathan Nandala-Mafabi. 3.53MR NATHAN NANDALA-MAFABI (FDC, Budadiri County West, Sironko): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I support the motion, but I want to move some amendments at the end. 12410MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONFirst, I am one of those who led the process to have the National Audit Act. THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, whoever is going to stand, you should make an amendment only. We are doing what we are constitutionally supposed to do. MR NANDALA-MAFABI: That is true. Madam Speaker, in most countries including South Africa, the Auditor-General works for one term, five years. However, I want to congratulate Mr John Muwanga, our Auditor-General, for having served for this entire time without having a crisis because most of the Auditor-Generals in most countries have been held for corruption and theft because they audit the national budget; the entire money is in their hands. They are treated more than the Chief Justice of any country in remuneration. The amendments I want to move; one, we have not heard about a handshake because the Auditor-General has worked and he is going. I have not heard about what we are paying him as he is going. THE SPEAKER: You mentioned how much you want us to pay him as a handshake. MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Madam Speaker, I am going to amend a handshake, but secondly, supposing you employed Auditor-General who does not reach 60 years, how do you pay him because I can come and work for only one week, but as an Auditor-General, I come and benefit from the law? We should put a minimum of the years you must work before you qualify for that benefit. Thirdly - THE SPEAKER: Let us move systematically. MR NANDALA-MAFABI: I want to put the cases then I handle them one by one. If the Auditor-General has worked, but due to ill health, he or she leaves, what do we do? In most cases, like somebody - in our Bible, the moment you are 70 years old, you have lived your useful life and I am not very sure- I am not saying that Mr Muwanga is going to die tomorrow. That lifetime payment may not even take more than 10 years. I would suggest that those who may not want it may have to compute it and get it in advance because he is not so sure that maybe for 10 years- so that he lives and remains with the little in his pocket. Madam Speaker, on the handshake, I move an amendment that we give Mr John Muwanga - THE SPEAKER: We give the Auditor-General. MR NANDALA-MAFABI: For this one because this is specific. Why we are saying Mr John Muwanga is because there will be another and the handshake will be different. This one is going to be paid as a result of service for 20 years. I want to say that for Mr John Muwanga, we give him 500 currency points for his handshake to go home. The justification is that we have decided that every year –(Interruption)-  500 currency points, that is Shs 1 billion - (Interruption) Hon. Nsereko could you help me in the division? I am aiming at getting - THE SPEAKER: You speak. MR NANDALA-MAFABI: One thousand is equal to twenty million. Ten thousand will be - (Interruption)-  I want you to get 1 billion. Thank you, Hon. Nsereko for making an argument. I suggest that we give Mr John Muwanga 50,000 currency points on his retirement as a handshake which is equivalent to Shs 1 billion so that every year he has worked; he takes Shs 50 million as his handshake. Secondly, for an Auditor-General to qualify - THE SPEAKER: Are you getting what Hon. Nathan Nandala-Mafabi is saying about the handshake? [Mr Nandala-Mafabi]12411THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024MR MUSASIZI: Thank you. THE SPEAKER: I want us to dispose of point by point. MR MUSASIZI: Madam Speaker, I concur with the principle, but I propose that instead of Shs 1 billion, we do Shs 500 million, so that is 25,000 currency points. THE SPEAKER:  We are on award. Yes, Hon. Jonathan? 3.59MR JONATHAN ODUR (UPC, Erute County South, Lira):  Madam Speaker, I support the motion. However, I would like to draw your attention and that of the minister to Article 254 of the Constitution. It can help us resolve the matter. It reads: “A public officer shall, on retirement, receive such pension as is commensurate with his or her rank, salary and length of service.” First, I propose that we do not use the word “handshake” because it is very dangerous for this Parliament to proceed that way. However, I get the principle that he deserves to be paid what is due to him. Therefore, because he has worked for several years, we can arrive at that lump sum pay which is due to any public officer paid at once. Thereafter, you provide –THE SPEAKER:  Which Article did you say? MR ODUR:  254. THE SPEAKER:  Article 254 talks about pensions.MR ODUR:  Yes, that is the principle I am bringing because this is somebody who has worked for 20 years and he is saying that another one may come and work for only two or three years. You cannot treat them the same way. At the beginning, the minister said that this would apply to all Auditor-Generals, so, it is not specific to only the current holder of the office. Thereafter, we must, as a matter of principle, provide for the estate in the event that the person has died. What happens to the estate? In some human resources, the family is catered for, for some period. That should also be clear in this case and an amendment should be made. MR NANADALA-MAFABI:  Madam Speaker, why I proposed handshake is because it is given to somebody for the good work done in an office. You may have your rules prescribing how you will be paid your terminal benefits, but a handshake says, thank you for the good job done. That is why I concur with the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development that having computed the other one following the rules, if it comes to Shs 500 million instead of Shs 1 billion is agreeable. This is because you will compute the other one following the rules put in place, but for purposes of having served for 20 years without having a problem, a handshake is recommended. Hon. Jonathan knows it. THE SPEAKER:  Yes, Hon. Christine –  4.01MS CHRISTINE KAAYA (NUP, Woman Representative, Kiboga):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. In line with the handshake, the wording is not okay. We can propose another word like “thank you”. I also suggest that it should be a percentage probably of a pension of some payment of this officer, because of inflation, the Shs 500 million may look a lot now, but later, it may be very little.THE SPEAKER: What Hon. Odur is saying is that must you call it a handshake? You cannot call it a handshake. We are the same people who brought a motion in this House over a handshake. You would rather call it a service award.  (Applause)4.02MS BETTY NALUYIMA (NUP, Woman Representative, Wakiso):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. In consonance with what Hon. Odur has just reminded us, under Article 254, we cannot run away from awarding our Auditor-General. I suggest that we agree on a principle that we are going to award him a percentage. I request that we have a committee chaired by the Speaker together with the finance minister 12412MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONand some other three Members to finalise on what we can manage, because we may not be in position to fully determine the different years in which all instalments would be made. We cannot be in position to determine what the budget is at this hour, but we are all in agreement that he deserves a retirement benefit and Parliament has seen what he has done. I beg that we decide on what to do. Let us have an inner committee composed of the Speaker, finance minister and some Members as we so wish. Thank you. THE SPEAKER:  Yes, Hon. Akol.4.04MR ANTHONY AKOL (FDC, Kilak North County, Amuru): Madam Speaker, there are two issues we are dealing with. The first is about the pension and the other is about the service award. Within the Committee on Finance, Planning and Economic Development, we have a subcommittee that deals with the Office of the Auditor-General. The issue at hand is, is there a formula for pension for the Auditor-General? If it is not there, that is what we need to determine. The second issue is the service award. I agree with Hon. Nandala-Mafabi on the figure of Shs 500 million that the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development also agreed on in terms of the service award. In addition, we need to look at the formula we are going to use for calculation of the pension of Auditor-General not only for this person, but as a continuity. That is my suggestion. Thank you.4.06MR WILSON KAJWENGYE (NRM, Nyabushozi County, Kiruhura):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. First, I support the motion that we need to recognise the distinguished service of Mr John Muwanga, who has been and remains the Auditor-General. The purpose of this motion is to make effect the provisions of the Constitution and the Auditor-General’s Act. Just like our Rules of Procedure does not allow us to debate in anticipation, my view is that we cannot sit here and be seen to be making resolutions that are personal to holder. If we debate the service awards and –THE SPEAKER:  Honourable member, I did not mention the name Mr John Muwanga. I said the Auditor-General and we are not discussing a person. We are discussing about an Auditor-General. I can also be an Auditor-General tomorrow or even you or anybody. As Parliament, what we are doing is what we ought to do. MR KAJWENGYE:  If I may conclude, Madam Speaker.THE SPEAKER:  Yes, on an award.MR KAJWENGYE:  Thank you. The resolution has put across brilliant ideas, including continuing to get his pay, the car and the house. It is befitting. My view is that in this country, we already have Commissions and Awards. I propose that the distinguished Auditor-General, Mr John Muwanga, gets an award just like many other distinguished persons of this country and a medal to that effect so that this Parliament is not seen to be – whatever we do here has an effect today and tomorrow.THE SPEAKER:  What does that awards’ commission do? Does it award you the financials? MR KAJWENGYE:  That is now determined by the Committee on Presidential Affairs. THE SPEAKER:  Were the framers of the law that say that, “Parliament shall determine…” not in their normal senses? MR KAJWENGYE:  You are right. We can amend that particular law so that we have distinguished persons who have given effect to service. [Ms Naluyima]12413THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Wilson, this Parliament will not give out its powers to a subcommittee created by what we do not know. Let us determine what an Auditor-General will get.MR KAJWENGYE:  I beg to submit.THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Nathan Nandala, we are still on your issue. MR NANDALA-MAFABI:  Madam Speaker, colleagues are assuming Mr John Muwanga or the Auditor-General as another officer. I want to tell you -THE SPEAKER:  By the way, he is an officer of Parliament. MR NANDALA-MAFABI:  Therefore, as an officer of Parliament, wouldn’t it be procedurally right that again Parliament determines what is befitting for our officer? THE SPEAKER : That is what we are doing. I saw Hon. Nathan addressing the press that he is going to be a President – (Laughter)– can I hear from the Leader of the Opposition (LOP). After Hon. Meddie, it will be the LOP. 4.10MR MUHAMMAD NSEREKO  (Independent, Kampala Central Division, Kampala City):  Thank you, Madam Speaker -THE SPEAKER:  I do not want us to spend all our time on this. I have seen the Minister of Public Service. We are independent of your public service. MR NSEREKO:  Madam Speaker, the distinguished services of the Auditor-General are not in doubt. Every single member of this society appreciates the services of the individual and also the integrity he has used in conducting his duties as the Auditor-General. However, we are setting a trend now. There will come a situation where, like Hon. Nandala-Mafabi has said, we will come back here as the House to pronounce ourselves on servants of this House or Members of Parliament, but we do have our pension scheme, anyway.Now that we are setting a new trend of a service award to the servants of this country, a motion has been generated and that this plenary is going to pronounce itself on a figure, probably as proposed by Hon. Nandala-Mafabi or the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development; that will draw a charge on the Consolidated Fund. Whenever we propose certain figures, the Minister of Finance himself comes out and states that, “you cannot post a charge on the Consolidated Fund”. The best thing would be to decide a formula that is adoptable to the office, whether you have served 10 or 20 years. We can say that, “if you have served for a minimum of five years, the currency points shall be this. If you have served for this period, the currency points must be this” – (Interjections) – just a second, let me conclude. We are drawing money from a taxpayer to give a service award to an office holder. I am a bit hesitant to take on this when it is for an individual.THE SPEAKER:  There is a procedural matter here.MR AKOL:  Madam Speaker, a service award is not given to everybody who has served in the office. Not every person that will serve in that office will have the integrity and appreciation that we want to give to this particular person. Therefore, we can have a service award as a figure based on this particular person, then you determine depending on another person that you are going to handle. And when handling the issue of pension, we can have a formula of how we can determine the pension, but not service award.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. Leader of the Opposition, then Hon. Jonathan.4.14THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  (Mr Joel Ssenyonyi):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I thought I would share my thoughts 12414MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONabout the other elements of the motion, but you have guided that we first dispose of this one –THE SPEAKER:  Please do it. MR SSENYONYI:  The entire motion?THE SPEAKER:  Yes.MR SSENYONYI:  Okay. The Office of the Auditor-General is a critical one because it serves Parliament in doing the audits, which feed into the accountability committees that are part of this House. I would like to first suggest to the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development that in future for you not to be misunderstood because the current Auditor-General is on his way out in about two or three months, bring these issues early enough because people might misunderstand you to say that you are working on it for him because he is on his way out. However, let us put that aside -THE SPEAKER:  Leader of the Opposition, in the future for Parliament of Uganda not to be misunderstood, they should bring this earlier. Hon. Musasizi is just a borrowed gun to come and make a presentation on your behalf. It is you Members of Parliament who should bring this earlier, not Hon. Musasizi. MR SSENYONYI:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I was only mentioning him because he is the mover of the motion -THE SPEAKER:  We have borrowed him to move.MR SSENYONYI:  Maybe next time, we should borrow him early enough. Anyhow, on “a monthly retirement benefit equivalent to the salary payable to a sitting Auditor-General and the retirement benefit shall be paid to the retired Auditor-General for life,” I would like to suggest an amendment here. When you pay the former Auditor-General the same as the sitting Auditor-General, then there is a problem Because this one is in office and working, the other one is former. They cannot be at the same level, honestly. People will prefer to retire, after all, they will earn the same amount. Therefore, there is a problem with (a). A precedent has been set for many of these offices and for -THE SPEAKER:  Honourable Leader of the Opposition, when you say that we make some change, give us a suggestion.MR SSENYONYI:  I want to first give the background and then suggest. I was going to say that a precedent has been set for most of these offices and usually, (a) The figure is half of what a sitting one earns because this one is in retirement and they cannot be at the same level; “(b)  A furnished house or a one-off payment of 20,000 currency points.” I want to suggest 10,000;“(c) An annual medical allowance equivalent to the medical allowance payable to a sitting Auditor-General.” Alright, medical allowance given the advanced age;“(d) A chauffeur-driven car or a one-off  payment of 20,000 currency points payable in lieu.” I want to suggest 10,000 currency points, which is Shs 200 million. That is what you people were given for cars; so it is a fair amount as opposed to 20,000 currency points – 10,000 currency points to make Shs 200 million. “(e)  Security…”“(f)  A fuel and vehicle repairs allowance of 100 currency points per month”? Okay. “(g)  An official burial by the State upon death”? That is okay.  “Service award?” Madam Speaker, I have issues with this “animal” called “service award”. Some have called it a handshake and I am glad you raised the issue of Parliament – in 2018, I believe it was, having discussed handshake, which was problematic. Similarly, a “service award,” especially when we want to tether it to an individual, becomes person-to-holder, there is a problem with that. [Mr Ssenyonyi]12415THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024Can we discuss a formula to award servants of this country, not just an individual or individual office? There is a real problem with that. So, I am personally opposed to this because it will not come off neatly. This is because that would mean that each time, we are going to be discussing for every individual officer or office bearer. It is even burdensome for us to do that.Possibly, the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development or whoever, needs to move a motion to say, “For servants of this country, a formula of sorts that is properly understandable…” However, if Parliament is going to sit each time to discuss for a particular individual, it is a problem. So, I am opposed to this service award. Thank you, Madam Speaker.THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, when we are debating all this, we must be aware that, one, this is our staff, two, we passed the one for judges and we gave the judges – what percentage?MR NANDALA-MAFABI:  Madam Speaker, we gave judges 75 per cent – the one of the Supreme Court. Then, for the ones of -THE SPEAKER:  And, when you are saying all this, I want you to know the level of the person you are talking about. It is not like me, a mere MP. MR ODUR:  Madam Speaker, for the record, for the judges, we varied them. For example, the Chief Justice is at 100 per cent. That is what we did here. So, I am making two proposals. The first is that instead of the different names we are giving, whether service or what, the motion requires us to determine a retirement benefit. Therefore, we are going to call it a retirement benefit. My proposal is that after (a), we insert the following: “A one-off lump sum retirement benefit equivalent to 2.6 per cent of the annual salary of the retiring Auditor-General, multiplied by five and the years of service.” That is the formula –(Interruption)THE SPEAKER:  Yes, you leave the mathematicians to speak. MR ODUR:  Yes, and I am not inventing anything new. We did the same formula -THE SPEAKER:  That gives you a total of Shs 500 -MR ODUR:  Exactly. THE SPEAKER:  Then, the percentage of the monthly pay?MR ODUR:  I propose 80 per cent. The minister had come with 100 per cent.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. The rest remains the same. Honourable members – yes, Hon. Nathan.MR NANDALA-MAFABI:  Madam Speaker, one, the Chief Justice was given 100 per cent - (Interjections) - please, listen to me. The Auditor-General is the one who audits the Chief Justice. In fact, Madam Speaker, if somebody who is above 70 years of age has served -THE SPEAKER:  Let us, first, hear from the finance minister – whether he is in agreement with what Hon. Odur has said.MR MUSASIZI:  Madam Speaker, on the first point of proposing a retirement benefit of a lump sum of 2.6 of the annual salary, for five years’ times the number of years in service as proposed by Hon. Odur, I do agree. I also agree with the proposal by Hon. Mafabi -THE SPEAKER:  Of?MR MUSASIZI: Of 100 per cent. This is one person in the country -THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, I now put the question that the motion for a resolution of Parliament to determine the post-retirement benefits of the Auditor-General, moved under Section 5(2) of the National Audit Act 2008, be adopted by this august House with amendments from Hon. Jonathan 12416MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONOdur and Hon. Nathan Nandala-Mafabi, the Secretary-General of FDC.(Question put and agreed to.)Motion, adopted.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you, Hon. Nathan, Hon. Jonathan, finance minister and the whole House – plus LoP. Next item.MOTION FOR ADOPTION OF REPORTS OF THE FOLLOWING SECTORAL COMMITTEES ON THE MINISTERIAL POLICY STATEMENTS AND BUDGET ESTIMATES FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2024/2025:I) COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SERVICE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTSTHE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, you will recall that the House commenced consideration of the sectoral committees’ reports on ministerial policy statements on Thursday the 4th of April. Pursuant to Rule 149 of the Rules of Procedure, today, the House will proceed with more committees’ reports, as listed on the Order Paper.Upon presentation and debate on the reports, the House will adopt the reports pursuant to Rule 149(2) of the Rules of Procedure. The recommendations will then be referred to the Budget Committee for reconciliation, harmonisation and consolidation.I invite the Chairperson of the Committee on Public Service and Local Government to present the report of the committee. I hope the committees considered the reports from the Opposition. Whoever did not consider the report from the opposition will not present; you will go back and consider it.MR NANDALA-MAFABI:  Madam Speaker, the procedural issue I am raising is that this House determines a lot of things. We have passed the motion on the Auditor-General, but there is one fundamental item, which I would like to get help from you on, Madam Speaker. We are assuming the Auditor-General, who will be coming in place, will be retiring at 70 –(Interjection)-  please, I am not raising that one; that one is done. Are we going to be doing it on a personal-to-holder basis or we have passed a general resolution? Why I am raising it is because if I came and worked up to 55 years of age and I retire, as Auditor-General, what time do I qualify for whatever? THE SPEAKER:  The formula has provided a number of years. I knew Hon. Nandala as the best accountant here. The formula is there. Where we find a challenge, we shall come back. Next item.4.28THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SERVICE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr Martin Ojara Mapenduzi):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. As I embark on this assignment, permit me to lay on Table the report of the committee. I also have the minutes of the committee meetings. I beg to lay.THE SPEAKER:  Please, lay.MR MAPENDUZI:  Madam Speaker, allow me to present the report of the committee on Public Service and Local Government on the Ministerial Policy Statements and Budget Estimates for Financial Year 2024/2025. For purposes of saving time, I request that we move to page 4, which provides details on the introduction. 1.0 IntroductionMadam Speaker, on the 15 March 2024, ministerial policy statements were laid before Parliament, and you directed that as required by the procedures, the respective committees should scrutinise these policy statements. In lieu thereof, the Committee on Public Service and Local Government considered the following votes: (i) V ote 011: Ministry of Local Government;(ii) V ote 147: Local Government Finance Commission;[The Speaker] SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORTS12417THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024(iii) V ote 500, 601 – 935: Local Governments;(iv) V ote 005: Ministry of Public Service;(v) V ote 146: Public Service Commission.The Committee thus presents its report in respect to the Ministerial Policy Statements and Budgetary Provisions for Financial Year 2024/2025 for consideration and adoption.2.0 MethodologyMadam Speaker, Page 5 is Methodology and I request that for purposes of time again, Members should permit me to proceed to the next section.3.0 Compliance to the relevant provisions of the law and cross-cutting issuesAgain, I request that you allow me proceed to Page 6.3.1  Compliance to the National Development Plan III  where the entities provided all that was required.3.2  Compliance of the MPS with the Public Finance Management Act, 2015 and the Rules of Procedure of the Parliament of Uganda.We provided a table; Table 1: Compliance of MPS with Public Finance Management Act, Financial Year 2023/2024.  For purposes of time again, you can look through. 3.3 Compliance to Gender and Equity IssuesWe have provided details, which are contained in this document. 3.4 Compliance with SDGS3.5 Compliance with Parliamentary RecommendationsMadam Speaker, the committee recommends that the entities under its purview should ensure continued engagement of the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to ensure that the rest of the recommendations are budgeted for in the Financial Year 2024/2025. 4.0 Public Service SectorMadam Speaker, this section of the report looks at the performance of the specific vote under the Public Service sector, covering the Ministry of Public Service and Public Service Commission. 4.1 Ministry of Public Service Madam Speaker, we have stated the mandates of the ministry.4.1.1 Strategic objectivesMadam Speaker, permit me to proceed to the next page in the interest of time. On page 9, there are key achievements in the Financial Year 2023/2024 and there are quite a number of them; 12 key achievements. Again, I request that Members run through for purposes of saving time. 4.1.3 Half Year PerformanceMadam Speaker, Parliament approved a total budget of Shs 33.586 billion for the Ministry of Public Service consisting of Shs 4.576 billion for wage, Shs 25.756 billion for non-wage and Shs 3.2 billion for development, as indicated in the table below; that is Table 2. We have provided a breakdown. At the end of the quarter two, a cumulative total of Shs 17.245 billion had been released representing 51.3 per cent of the approved annual budget estimates. Out of the release, the ministry spent a total of Shs 11.787 billion representing 68.6 per cent absorption rate at half year as shown in the above table.At the end of quarter two, a balance of Shs 5.433 billion remained unutilised within the ministry budget. The unspent balance at the end of the quarter is attributed to several factors, including pending staff recruitment and retirement, delays in procurement processes, 12418MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONand the release of funds designated for two quarters. Consequently, the implementation of activities spanning two quarters were extended into quarter three.4.1.4 Ministry of Public Service Budget Projections The ministry’s budget is projected to increase by Shs 2.97 billion representing 8.1 per cent from Shs 33.531 billion to Shs 36.502 billion in the next financial year. Again, we have provided a table that you can look through. That is Table 3, which is the Proposed Budget Estimates for Financial Year 2024/2025 and the Medium Term per category.As seen in the table above, in the Financial Year 2024/2025, the Ministry of Public Service has been allocated Shs 36.502 billion, of which Shs 4.278 billion is wage, Shs 29.024 billion is non-wage, Shs 3.2 billion is development budget, and Shs 0.056 billion is arrears. The increase in non-wage is attributed to an increase of Shs 2.5 billion from the Development Plan Implementation Programme for the Centre for Public Policy Research and Innovation, aimed at enhancing performance of public officers, along with an additional Shs 0.5 billion from the Sustainable Energy Development Programme.4.1.5 Key Budget Priorities for  Financial Year 2024/2025  There are key priorities that have been outlined. The key priorities areas for Financial Year 2024/2025 for Ministry of Public Service include the following;1. Continued rationalisation of Government agencies to eliminate duplication and mandate overlap for improved efficiency in public resource utilisation.2. Institutionalise a community-based approach to monitoring and reporting compliance with Service Delivery Standards.3. Establishment and operationalisation of three Service Uganda Centres for Government integrated Services to improve accessibility and affordability of Public Services to citizens.4. Funding interventions that leverage on ICT to ensure climate change mitigation and accountability for results and increased scope of work (E-inspection, Electronic Document Record Management System (EDRMS) and Human Capital Management.5. Strengthening of human resource management capacity, standards, operations and performance management systems in service delivery.6.  Operationalisation of the National Emoluments Review Body.7.  Reform of Public Service Pension Scheme8.  Procurement of goods and services aligning with sustainable public procurement practices and climate change mitigation.9.  Strengthen capacity of public officers in mainstreaming cross cutting issues including gender, equity, climate change, HIV and TB.4.1.6 Committee Observations and Recommendations(i) Delayed rationalisation of Government agencies:In 2018, the Government undertook to Rationalise Agencies and Public Expenditure under RAPEX with a view of eliminating structure ambiguities, functional duplications and overlaps, wasteful expenditures, and realising savings which could facilitate critical public services.Several Bills have been introduced on the rationalisation of Government agencies to Parliament, but were later withdrawn faulting Certificates of Financial Implications. The Bills are yet to be re-introduced and indeed, today, you were handling that.Madam Speaker, the committee recommends that the Government fast-tracks the process of merging, mainstreaming and transferring the agencies and report to Parliament before the end of the Financial Year 2023/2024.[Mr Mapenduzi] SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORTS12419THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024(ii)   Compensation of staff to be laid off under RAPEXShs 74.034 billion is required to fully cater for the payment of gratuity, pension and severance packages for the staff affected by RAPEX. Out of the affected entities, only the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development has a budget provision of Shs 1.546 billion to cater for the affected staff while the rest are unfunded. This is attributed to the fact that the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development was among the first entities to be affected by the rationalisation of the Rural Electrification Agency being transferred to the Ministry.Committee recommendationThe committee recommends that the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development provides Shs 74.034 billion in the Budget for the Financial Year 2024/2025 to cater for the payment of gratuity, pension and severance packages for the staff affected by RAPEX.(iii) Establishment and Rationalisation of the National Emoluments Review Board Madam Speaker, the Government through the Ministry of Public Service undertook to streamline salaries across the country by establishing a National Emoluments Review Board. This was mainly prompted by the huge differences between the salaries of mainstream public servants and those in the statutory agencies.The committee notes that the National Emoluments Review Board shall promote good governance, boost morale, enhance public trust and contribute to Uganda’s economic and social development through improved accountability, equity and transparency. For this cause, the Ministry of Public Service requires Shs 0.800 billion, which has not been provided for in the Budget for the Financial Year 2024/2025.Committee recommendationsThe committee recommends that: a) The Ministry of Public Service expedites the process of establishing and operationalisation of the National Emoluments Review Board before the end of the Financial Year 2024/2025;b) Shs 0.800 billion be provided for in the budget estimate of the Financial Year 2024/2025 to operationalise the National Emoluments Review Board.(iv) Vehicles for former leadersThe Ministry of Public Service requires Shs 7.2 billion for vehicles for former leaders. This is a statutory obligation in fulfilment of the provision of the Presidential Emoluments and Benefits Act, 2010 and fell due in the Financial Year 2021/2022. The committee notes that:a) The Parliamentary Pensions Act (Amended), 2007 entitles retirement benefits to retired Speakers such as pension, gratuity, chauffeur-driven cars, medical care, security, utilities and domestic staff. On the other hand, the Presidential Emoluments and Benefits Act Cap 263 as amended entitles retired Presidents, Vice Presidents and Prime Ministers to similar retirement benefits.b) Some of the leaders who have retired from the offices in the above-mentioned Acts have held and still hold offices that draw retirement benefits under both the Parliamentary Pensions Act and the Presidential Emoluments and Benefits Act. This creates a risk of duplication and waste of public resources.Committee recommendationsa) While funds should be provided for the purchase of vehicles of the aforementioned leaders, duplication and wastage of public resources should be avoided;12420MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONb) Priority should be given to former leaders who currently do not occupy any public office;c) The aforementioned laws be harmonised or amended to address the duplication of retirement benefits;d) Funds be provided for the purchase of vehicles for the aforementioned leaders based on the harmonisation of the retirement benefits.v) Pension IrregularitiesOver the years, the Auditor-General’s reports have indicated that many staff and retirees face delayed access to salary and pension pay ro11 despite the decentralisation of the payroll in respective institutions. The delay is attributed to mainly mismatch of data between NIRA and IPPS interfaces. The Ministry of Public Service is currently rolling out the Human Capital Management system (HCM), which aims to address these challenges. To-date, the Ministry of Public Service has finalised the rollout of HCM in 49 entities under phase 2.The Committee observed that delayed access to the pension payroll contravenes Article 254 of the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995, which provides that the payment of pension shall be prompt, regular and easily accessible to pensioners. Such delays lead to poor wellbeing of the affected retirees as well as accumulation of pension arrears and this frustrates the efforts in achieving social protection of the retirees.Committee recommendationsThe committee recommends that:a) The Ministry of Public Service should ensure that the Human Capital Management System is rolled out expeditiously to all entities to resolve the identified gaps;b) The Ministry of Public Service should ensure that the system automatically transitions employees from the salary payroll to the pension payroll once they clock the retirement age.(vi) The Public Servants Pension Fund BillAccording to the Ministry of Public Service, the Public Service Pension Fund Bill has since been reviewed in light of the proposals from Parliament and other consultative meetings in preparation for the first reading. However, the Ministry of Public Service has a funding gap of Shs 1.7 billion which will be used to support pre-reform activities for the intended Public Service pension reform process, including the Public Service Pension Fund Act, Regulations (2), and sensitisation activities, among others.Committee recommendationsThe committee recommends that: a) The Ministry of Public Service expedites any pending processes on the Bill and ensures that it is brought to Parliament before the end of the Financial Year 2024/2025;b) An additional Shs 1.7 billion is provided in the Budget for the Financial Year 2024/2025 to support the necessary pre-reform activities for the public service pension reform process. (vii) Verification of the payroll by the Auditor-General requiring Shs 1.3 billionThe Ministry of Public Service placed a ban on recruitment to allow the Auditor-General to carry out an audit of the staff payroll. Whereas this was a good gesture, it has affected service delivery across Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). Based on the recent findings of the Auditor-General, there was a revision of wages for all votes based on the number of employees cleared during the special audit. The Ministry of Public Service had a reduction of Shs 0.298 billion in the wage amount.The report by the Office of the Auditor-General also recommended verification of the partially verified public officers and officers appointed after the audit exercise. This output has been partially funded and the number of public [Mr Mapenduzi] SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORTS12421THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024officers expected to be verified is beyond what had been initially anticipated. The ministry requires Shs 1.35 billion for this exercise, but only Shs 0.05 billion has been provided leading to a shortfall of Shs 1.3 billion.The committee recommends that:a) The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development provides Shs 7.38 billion in the Financial Year 2024/25 to expedite and conclude the process of verification of public officers;b) The Office of the Auditor-General expedites the verification process, particularly the officers who were appointed, after the initial verification process;c) The Ministry of Public Service should lift the ban on recruitment to enable entities to carry out planned recruitment and address the problem of understaffing, which is greatly affecting service delivery.Madam Speaker, 4.2 V ote 146: Public Service Commission (PSC) and 4.2.1 talks about mandate. Permit me to move to the next page, which is 4.2.2 Strategic Objectives. Again, I request that you allow me to move to the next page, which is 4.2.3 which provides for the achievements and we have provided a detailed table that runs from page 20 to 21. I request that you allow me to proceed to page 22, which is 4.2.4 Financial Year 2023/2024 half year performance Madam Speaker, Parliament approved Shs 11.893 billion for Public Service Commission in the Financial Year 2023/2024. The table 5 below gives details of the performance.As indicated in table 5 above, out of the approved budget of Shs 11.893 billion, the commission had only spent Shs 4.896 billion by the end of quarter 2, representing 41.1 per cent.4.2.5 Budget estimates and the medium-term budget allocationsThe Commission’s budget for the Financial Year 2024/2025 stands at Shs 12.916 billion as detailed in the table 6 below. We have provided the details. The Commission’s budget is projected to increase by Shs 8.5 billion from Shs 11.893 billion to Shs 12.916 billion in the next financial year as shown in the table above. Page 23 gives key priorities as provided in the table. For purposes of time, Madam Speaker, permit me to move to page 24 and take you through the committee observations and recommendations. 4.2.7 Committee observations and recommendations (i)  Rollout E-recruitment system to District/City Service Commissions. The committee observed that;a) Corruption and nepotism has been rampant in the recruitment process. In order to curtail corruption and improve transparency at the District and City Service Commission, there is an urgent need to roll out the E-Recruitment System.b) Roll out of the E-recruitment system is, however, likely to affect some districts like in Karamoja Subregion due to the poor network coverage and technical glitches.Committee recommendations The committee recommends that;a) The Ministry of Public Service should work with NITA-U to address the said challenges on network coverage in the affected areas.b) A total of Shs 4.3 billion be provided in the budget to enable Public Service Commission upgrade and, roll out the E–recruitment processes across the country.12422MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION(ii) Lack of development budget The committee observed that the PSC has been operating without a development budget, yet it has priorities to be fulfilled under its core mandate. As a result, some key activities were not carried out. The priorities that have been unfunded under the development budget include the following;We have provided details of that and you can look through. Let me take you through the recommendations. The committee recommendation The committee recommends that the Public Service Commission’s development budget of Shs 5.412 billion be reinstated in the Financial Year 2024/2025 and funds released accordingly.(iii) Non-wage recurrent budget The PSC non-wage recurrent budget was cut down, leading to failure to carry out a number of key activities. The priority areas under the non-wage recurrent budget that were affected include:a) Full rollout of the E-recruitment system to District and City Service Commissions, which is necessary to minimise operational costs of conducting physical interviews, promote transparency and reduce corruption allegations on the City and District Service Commissions.b) Support to District/City Service Commissions, in order to stop irregularities and corruption at recruitment and disciplinary control within local Governments. c) Reference and background checks and verification of qualifications of the newly appointed public servants and members of City and District Service Commissions, in addition to validation of permanent and contract staff.The committee recommends that the non-wage recurrent budget for Public Service Commission of Shs 12.4 billion be included in the Financial Year 2024/2025 and funds be availed on time.5.0 Local Government Sector This section of the report looks at the performance of the specific votes under the Local Government sector which include:  V ote 011:  Ministry of Local Governments; V ote 147: Local Governments Finance Commission; and V ote (601-935): all local governments in Uganda.5.1 V ote 011 – Ministry of Local GovernmentsMadam Speaker, under that, we have provided clearly on the mandates of the ministry and 5.1.1 is the strategic objectives. Permit me to take you to page 28. 5.1.2 Major achievements that the ministry scored in Financial Year 2023/2024.Some of the half year achievements of the ministry include the following. We have provided a list of the achievements and they are quite a number, permit me to take you to page 29.5.1.3 Half year performance for Financial Year 2023/2024In the Financial Year 2023/2024, the Ministry of Local Governments was allocated a total of Shs 166.191 billion as indicated in table 8 below.Out of the approved budget of Shs 166.191 billion in Financial Year 2023/2024, Shs 10.093 was for wage, Shs 30.614 billion was for non-wage, Shs 22.560 was for capital development expenditures, Shs 102.816 billion for external financing and Shs 0.107 billion for domestic arrears as seen above in Table 8.By end of the Financial Year 2023, Shs 89.535 billion which represents 53.8 per cent had been released out of which Shs 56.867 billion was spent representing an absorption rate of 63.51 per cent.[Mr Mapenduzi] SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORTS12423THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 20245.1.4 Ministry of Local Governments Budget allocationsIn the Financial Year 2024/2025, the ministry has been allocated a total budget of Shs 202.395 billion as summarised in Table 9 below. Out of the total budget of Shs 202.395 billion, Shs 9.297 billion is to finance the Wage Bill of the ministry and Shs 43.712 billion for Non-Wage Recurrent Expenditures. The budget for the Government of Uganda development amounts to Shs 21.360 billion while that for external financing totals to Shs 127.789 billion. In addition, the ministry has been allocated Shs 0.237 billion for pension and gratuity arrears and other domestic arrears.5.1.5 Ministry of Local Government priorities for the Financial Year 2024/2025Based on the above proposed budget in table 9, in the Financial Year 2024/2025, the ministry has prioritised the following interventions:a)  Coordination and monitoring of PDM implementationb)  Rehabilitation of agro processing facilitiesc)  Waste managementd)  Local economic developmente)  Agri-LEDf)  Markets and Agricultural Trade Improvement Project. Under this, the ministry plans to review and prepare designs for eight markets of Nebbi Central, Nyahuka Town Council, Iganga Central, Kotido Main Market, Kisoro Old Market, Karuguuza Daily Market, Kibale Town Council, Mpigi Central and Masindi. In addition, the ministry will identify and prepare eight temporary relocation sites in urban centres and undertake needs assessment for value addition facilities under MATIP 3.5.1.6 Committee observations and recommendations(i) Harmonisation of the legal frameworkThe committee observed that the contradictions in the legal framework surrounding local government finances have affected service delivery for several years now. Committee observes that whereas the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, 1995, and the Local Government Act, Cap. 243 provide for decentralisation and the devolution of functions, powers and services and empowers local governments to levy, charge, collect and appropriate local revenues. Local revenue is instead remitted to the consolidated fund.  This is attributed to the Treasury Single Account Payment Processing and Reporting System.  And the directive by the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to transit all local revenues collected to Consolidated Fund for subsequent allocation to the respective local governments.As a result, local governments face financial difficulties because of the increased and consistent retention of local revenue by the Central Government over time. For instance, Shs 3.1 trillion was held in the Consolidated Fund in the Financial Year 2023/2024.  This has crippled service delivery at the local level in that urgent and even simple services like garbage collection have stagnated. More importantly, local governments have been demoralised and rendered powerless to effect service delivery, which has also demoralised taxpayers from paying taxes.  As a result, the share of local revenue contribution to the national envelope has dropped from 13 per cent in the financial year 2022 to 9.8 per cent currently. The committee observes that decentralisation was intended to extend services closer to people and recognise the economic and social transformational frontline role that local governments play to deliver services to the people. This role should be aided and not curtailed. While the committee recognises that the previous system where local revenues would be collected and spent at source had challenges, recentralisation of local revenues is not the solution.12424MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONGovernment should instead focus on addressing the challenges associated with spending local revenues at source by, for example, enforcing its policy reform to address capacity gaps, incompetence and corruption in local government. The committee also takes note of the fact that Parliament has time and again expressed the need to review the seemingly contradictory legal frameworks, but Ministry of Finance has not taken concrete steps to reverse the status quo.  Committee recommendations 1. Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development should withdraw the directive to local governments to remit local revenues collected by the local governments to the Consolidated Fund in line with Section 29(1) and (3) of the Public Finance Management Act. And local governments be allowed to collect, manage and spend the local revenues from a general fund account maintained at the district level in accordance with Section 80 to 82 of the Local Governments Act and other relevant laws.  2. The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and Ministry of Local Government expedites the process of addressing the shortcomings associated with the collection and management of local revenues at source by local governments before and at the end of the calendar year 2024. This is to aid the local governments in handling their local revenues.  Under Markets and Agriculture Trade Improvements Programme (MATIP) 3Committee observationsi. All the markets built under Markets and Agriculture Trade Improvements Programme MATIP 1 and 2 are complete and functional.  ii. There has been significant economic improvement and household income in the areas where the MATIP markets have been constructed.  iii. There are design challenges and gaps in the completed MATIP markets that are posing serious challenges to the vendors in those markets.  iv. Functionality and utilisation in some markets remain poor, for example, in Busia Municipality, where the market is functioning at about 30 per cent.v. Some cities are highly populated, hence overcrowding in the constructed markets. vi. The MATIP markets are concentrated majorly in cities and municipalities, leaving out town councils that are highly populated and require such facilities.  Recommendations1. Funds be availed for the additional eight markets under MATIP 3.  2. In addition to the eight markets, Ministry of Local Government should include Kaliro Town Council, Kamuli Municipality, Adjumani Town Council and an additional market for Gulu City.  3. Ministry of Local Government should carry out a detailed technical assessment of the constructed markets with a view of correcting the defects and design errors therein. 4. Ministry of Local Government should use the existing markets and the challenges observed in their operationalisation to inform the design for the plan of MATIP 3 markets. 5. Ministry of Local Government should pay attention during the design phase and all the consultants accountable for any design flaws.  Remuneration of leaders Madam Speaker, the committee observed that local service delivery and overall development across the country is greatly dependent on motivated and well-facilitated political leaders who carry out monitoring, oversight, legislation and executive functions in local governments.  [Mr Mapenduzi] SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORTS12425THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024However, the remuneration of local government leaders is poor and affects their performance and also fuels corruption.  Secondly, local political leaders are not entitled to gratuity on completion of their term of office, unlike civil servants who get gratuity and pension. The Ministry of Local Government and other stakeholders have, over the years, recommended improving the payment of local council chairpersons and councillors, but these recommendations have not been implemented and yet the roles of local leaders keep increasing. For instance, the increased supervisory roles under the Parish Development Model. Remunerating the above categories of political leaders will require Shs 378,903,300,000 per annum, up from Shs 76,830,060,000 shillings.  The committee recommends that;1. The proposal on enhancement of salaries for political leaders at all levels of local government be given due consideration and their pay revised upwards.  2. A budget for gratuity for political leaders be included in the ministry’s plan going forward and ensure that it is included in the budget estimate for the Financial Year 2025/2026. Parish Development Model  Given the various issues regarding the PDM, Parliament has since resolved that Ministry of Local Government should be facilitated to complete rollout and monitoring of the PDM.  RecommendationThe committee recommends as follows:a.  Shillings 18 billion be provided for full rollout of PDM in the Financial Year 2024/2025, including Shs 8 billion for the PDM Secretariat and Shs 10 billion for the Ministry of Local Government.  b.   Equity and Gender under PDM.  The Equal Opportunities Commission report released in November 2023 noted that PDM guidelines ring-fenced quotas for special interest groups, which is 30 per cent youth, 30 per cent women, 10 per cent elderly, 10 per cent disabled, but are not being followed by most local governments.  This is attributed to the focus on the households and the criteria for allocation of PDM funds based on the number of parishes rather than the population size. Which has resulted in inequity in distribution of funds. This concern has also been noted in the alternative ministerial policy statement.  The Ministry of Local Government explained that it has disseminated the guidelines and provided technical field support to all local governments to ensure that the percentage allocation is followed.  The allocation of funds to the beneficiaries is done by SACCOs and the Ministry of Local Government intends to follow up the activities of these SACCOs. The review process for this pro-rata allocation of PDM funds based on the number of parishes is being undertaken by the Ministry of Local Government for the attention of Cabinet. The Committee also noted that the Equal Opportunity Commission report recommends improvement of regional balance in some projects, such as the food security and nutrition projects where Karamoja and Bukedi, which are the most affected regions, are not covered. The Ministry of Local Government explained that the National Development Plan 3 chose eight regions to focus on, but undertook to ensure that the new projects take into consideration the two underserved regions, that is Karamoja and Bukedi. In addition, the Equal Opportunities Commission report pointed out the majority of local government council halls do not have standard ramps and suitable office environment for people with disabilities. The EOC recommended improvement of the infrastructure to enable PWDs participate in decision making. 12426MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONThe Ministry of Local Government undertook to communicate to the local governments to improve the existing infrastructure to provide ramps for persons with disability on all office infrastructure. Recommendationsi. The Ministry of Local Government should ensure that affirmative action for disadvantaged regions is covered in its project. ii. The Ministry of Local Government should communicate to all local governments to ensure a safe environment for people with disabilities and follow up to ensure they have implemented the infrastructure update. Induction of local leaders Madam Speaker, cases of conflict in local governments continue to persist. This is attributed to lack of induction on roles and responsibilities of different players in local governments. The Ministry of Local Government is in need of Shs 5 billion to conduct induction for newly elected local leaders in the remaining local governments. The committee observed that the induction of local leaders at this time is likely to be a waste of resources since the next general election season starts next year, and new leaders may be elected.Committee’s recommendationsThe committee recommends as follows:(i) The Ministry of Local Government should instead plan for induction in the Financial Year 2025/2026 for the new leaders who will be elected in the 2026 general elections, since the current leadership will be ending their term of office in the same financial year. (ii) Shillings 3 billion, from the proposed Shs 5 billion for induction in the ministry’s budget for the Financial Year 2024/2025, be allocated to facilitate the ministry in ensuring the functionality of the agro-processing facilities that were built under Community Agriculture Infrastructure Improvement Programme (CAIIP). (iii) Shillings 2 billion, from the proposed Shillings 5 billion for induction, be allocated for capacity building activities under the Ministry of Local Government. (vi) Review of Decentralisation Madam Speaker, permit me to look through the recommendations. The committee recommends that Shs 2 billion in the budget for the Financial Year 2024/2025, be provided to cover consultation and preparatory activities for the review of the decentralisation policy throughout the country. (vii) Operationalisation of the remaining five cities Madam Speaker, Parliament approved the establishment of 15 cities in 2020, of which 10 are already operational. The remaining five cities of Wakiso, Entebbe, Kabale, Moroto and Nakasongola are set to commence on 1 July 2025, and the Ministry of Local Government requires Shs 1 billion for preparatory activities. The committee recommends that funds worth Shs 1 billion for preparatory activities – THE SPEAKER: Which cities? MR MAPENDUZI: Madam Speaker, these are cities that were approved by Parliament in 2020 and they are; Wakiso, Entebbe, Kabale, Moroto and Nakasongola. (Applause)The committee recommends that funds worth Shs 1 billion for preparatory activity – THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, before we start clapping, we need to know if we have the money to operationalise any administrative unit. The minister should be able to tell us that. Do we have the money for the road fund for administrative units? MR MAPENDUZI: Thank you, Madam Speaker. [Mr Mapenduzi] SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORTS12427THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024(viii) Digitalisation of local government revenuesMadam Speaker, permit me to take you through the recommendations. The committee recommends that the Ministry of Local Government receives all the support needed to continue rolling out the digitalisation process, to enable all local governments to improve their revenue performance, as this would contribute to better service delivery and governance in the local revenue. (ix) Budget performance a. Performance on mandate Madam Speaker, permit me to take you to page 39 on recommendation. The committee recommends that the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development should ensure full and timely release of the approved funds to the Ministry of Local Government, to enable it to undertake crucial activities without strain. b. Limited funds and late release The committee recommends the following: (i) The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development should always release the budgeted for funds in time and in full to enable the Ministry of Local Government –(Interjections)-  Madam Speaker, I beg for your protection. Thank you.(ii) The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development should provide the funds for inspection and supervision to the Ministry of Local Government to be an effective driver of development across the country. c. Under-absorption of fundsThe committee recommends the following: i) The Ministry of Local Government should ensure timely initiation of procurement and engage all stakeholders involved in procurement processes, in order to absorb the budgeted funds and prevent the possibility of money being swept back to the Consolidated Fund. ii) The concerned entities in the procurement processes should abide by the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Act, as amended, to ensure that V otes are able to absorb their funds accordingly. V otes 601-935 – all local governmentsOn page 41, we have strategic objectives and achievements of the local governments. On page 42, we have resource envelope for local governments. In Financial Year 2024/2025, local governments have been allocated Shs 5,816,000,000,000 of which Shs 3,333,000,000,000 is for wages, Shs 1,547,000,000,000 is non-wage, Government of Uganda development is 644 billion, and Shs 292 billion is local revenue. All these funds will be spent on delivery of the decentralised services, as per the Second Schedule of the Local Government Act, CAP 243. The schedule of detailed allocation per local government is annexed. We have provided that in the report. Committee’s observations Madam Speaker, permit me to take you directly to recommendations, on page 43. The committee recommends that an additional Shs 300 million be provided within the budget for the Financial Year 2024/2025 for the Department of Urban Administration, including increased subvention for Urban Authorities Association of Uganda (UAAU) and The Alliance of Mayors and Municipal Leaders’ Initiative for Community Action on AIDS at the Local Level (AMICAALL). (ii) Sustainable urbanisation and housingUnder sustainable urbanisation and housing, the committee recommends that an additional Shs 144 million be provided in the Financial 12428MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONYear 2024/2025 to enable local governments to deliver on their mandates under this programme. (iii) Delayed disbursement of fundsPermit me to take you to page 44 and go straight to recommendations. The committee recommends that the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development should ensure timely release of funds to local governments as per the approved work plans. (iv) Inadequate staffing of local governmentsPermit me to take you through page 45, and straight to the recommendations. The committee recommends that the Ministry of Local Government should seek fresh approval from the Ministry of Public Service in order to fill the pending positions. (v) Funding for 327 subcounties displaced by new town councilsMadam Speaker, there are subcounties that require Shs 16.35 billion. The committee recommends that Shs 16.35 billion be given to support the construction of office blocks for these 327 displaced subcounties. Madam Speaker, some of these subcounties sit under trees, while some of them use kiosks. (vi) Procurement of motor vehicles for local government leadersMadam Speaker, I will take you straight to the recommendations – but it is sad to note that we have already lost local government chairpersons. Some of them have been involved in accidents and they have not recovered. Since they do not have transport, they use vehicles that are in dangerous mechanical conditions. The committee recommends that Shs 36.96 billion to procure double cabin pick-up trucks for 176 local government leaders at Shs 210 million each, be provided to help in enhancing service delivery at local government level.(vii) Ex-gratia  and honoraria for local government leadersAgain, the committee recommends the following; a)  Shillings 33 billion shortfall for ex-gratia and honoraria of local government leaders to be included in the budget. There is a shortfall of that amount.b) Shillings 9.9 billion be provided to cover arrears. There have been arrears of Shs 9.9 billion, so it has to be provided in the next financial year budget. Under Road Fund, Madam Speaker, in this financial year, Shs 1 billion was allocated to all local governments for road maintenance. We have talked about it. Let me now take you through the recommendations:  1. The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development should honour the directive on the release of Shs 1 billion for roads to all districts, cities and municipalities.2. The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development should release all the Road Funds by the third quarter, as it is with other development funds.3. Uganda Road Fund and the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development should provide the required funds to all unserved town councils and sub-counties to boost physical plan implementation, access and local economic development.Let me take you straight to recommendations and they are as follows:The committee recommends that each of the 10 cities and 31 municipalities be provided with a full set of road equipment. (viii) Conditional grant for physical planning Recommendation The committee recommends that Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development should make budgetary provisions for physical [Mr Mapenduzi] SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORTS12429THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024planning in cities, municipalities and town councils. (ix) Delayed clearance to recruitRecommendationThe committee recommends that the Ministry of Public Service should give authority to recruit in June so that recruitment processes can start in July for each of the financial year. There is a tendency of delay, Madam Speaker, which hinders these activities.V ote 147: Local Government Finance Commission. That looks at strategic objectives and achievements. Permit me to take you to page 50, which is on Half-year Performance of Financial Year 2023/2024. Again, we have provided those details. Permit me to take you to the next, which is the budget estimate for Financial Year 2024/2025 and the medium-term per category. For Financial Year 2024/2025, the Commission has been allocated Shs 11.7 billion, which is a decrease by 0.001 from Shs 11.008 billion to Shs 11.007 billion in the next financial year, as provided in the table below.On page 51, we are provided observations and let me take you straight to recommendations. The committee recommends the following; a)  Ministry of Local Government proceeds to engage with the Attorney-General to give legal opinion on the constitutional issues raised by the local government Finance Commission.b)  The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development should always comply with the Constitution in ensuring that the budget for Local Government Finance Commission, as approved by Parliament, is not varied during the financial year. Next page is 52 - Lack of retooling budgetRecommendation The committee recommends that Shs 600 million be provided to the Local Government Finance Commission for retooling in order for the Commission to fully operationalise.Madam Speaker, here the Commission lacks transport. There are cases where the Chairperson of the Commission and the team have had mechanical breakdowns on their way and they failed to reach their destination. RecommendationThe committee recommends that - I had already read that - Shs 600 million be provided to this Commission, Local Government Finance Commission.iii) Integrated Revenue Administration System (IRAS)Recommendation The committee recommends that Local Government Finance Commission should prioritise the rollout of IRAS in all local governments to address the challenges of local revenue collection and management. iv) Gender and equity compliance Recommendation The committee recommends that the Local Government Finance Commission pays attention to any and address gender and equity issues with the guidance of the Equal Opportunity Commission, so as to continue improving its score. Madam Speaker, there are key unfunded and underfunded priorities for the Financial Year 2024/2025 and the committee identified the critical yet unfunded priorities as listed. We have provided a detailed list of these unfunded priorities. In the interest of time, I request that you allow me to run through them very quickly, if that is permitted. 12430MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONTHE SPEAKER: Hon. Mapenduzi, the report you have given us is an oversight report for the whole sector. A very big report and I wish you people have been giving such reports. As of today, my expectation was the sector budgetary allocation for 2024, the budgetary shortfall, observations and recommendations. That is what I expected of you, but you have taken us through the whole.At the end of the day, you are going to do harmonisation, the reconciliation, and consolidation with the Budget Committee. Thank you for giving us all that long report. The shortfalls will be looked at by the Budget Committee. MR MAPENDUZI: Thank you very much. I take your advice, Madam Speaker.THE SPEAKER: All the other chairpersons that are coming, we just want the shortfalls, the budgetary allocation and your recommendations and what you think should be done by this House to help. MR MAPENDUZI: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I take that guidance. It is only our hope that the unfunded and underfunded priorities be given due attention because if we care about this country, then local governments have to be given what they deserve.Madam Speaker, I would like to bring to your attention that there is also a minority report. Thank you.THE SPEAKER: Thank you. Can we hear the minority report? With the guidelines that I have given. 5.27MS ETHEL NALUYIMA (NUP, Woman Representative, Wakiso):  Madam Speaker, with that guidance - but it is the very matter of policy and given that we are handling policies.I thank the committee chairperson for the very time we went through because I am in agreement with all the issues we handled. As I start my minority report, please allow me to lay on the Table the very report I am about to cite. Madam Speaker, as we emphasise the need to ensure that we strengthen local governments in the country, let us please look at that report fully. My minority issue is about the Parish Development Model (PDM). Allow me to the attention of this House, that there are several matters we cited as the alternative government and we found that the PDM as earlier envisaged has several gaps. As part of our observations, we are seeing that the PDM today as launched in 2022, is not delivering as expected. Recall we were promised that this is going to be the game changer of all things. Getting to the very last page, we are saying that - THE SPEAKER: It is going to be a game changer by which year? MS NALUYIMA: We were promised at the start that in everything the PDM that is coming, this model for this time -THE SPEAKER: You know that everything that you do has a timeline. By 2030, 2025, we just -MS NALUYIMA: Madam Speaker, I beg that I first present, then Members understand my issues, they get everything, then later on I can get further into the details. Madam Speaker, it is important to recall that the Government of Uganda, indeed, as over the years, comes up with different programmes meant to improve the living conditions of Ugandans. Unfortunately, none of the programs have made meaningful positive economic and social impact on the population, partly because of the way they are implemented. We should recall that when we talk about the PDM, it replaced programmes like the Uganda Women Empowerment Programme (UWEP), where our money was as women of Uganda, National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADs), Luweero-Rwenzori Development Program, among others. SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORTS12431THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024It is, therefore, our considered view that the PDM is not translating into increased household incomes and alleviation of poverty in its current state nor can it substantially improve the quality of life of citizens or contribute to an increase in production. The model is characterised by mismanagement at the point of introduction of groups. Look at how the officials in Kitgum in 2021 were arrested over the misappropriation of Shs 526 million. We still note that the model in its current state does not have a unified monitoring tool, there exists unapproved SACCOs since the inception of the model two years back and it is discriminatory in nature. As I interacted with several Muslim communities in these local governments, they said, they cannot take on this because in their beliefs they do not allow anything that attracts interest. In the very main report, we have already given the quotas- I agree with that one. But, the model is not also observing the quotas as highlighted before. This programme adopted a one-size-fits-all method of allocation of funds in total disregard of the varying population in parishes in this country. A parish like Kireka in Wakiso with over 100 people is compared to the same - and a parish like Mutungo, which has 64,663 people is also compared to the same as a smaller parish like Ibbiaworo Parish in Adjumani, which has 892 people. This is per the latest UBOS population statistics. This very model as we talk today is not considering the different things. We therefore propose that the different needs of the different societies. We therefore request that today – THE SPEAKER:  There is a procedural matter.MS NALUYIMA:  Madam Speaker, I beg that I finish then later on you can give the overall ruling such that at least this idea can be got. I beg to be given space. THE SPEAKER:  Let her finish. MS NALUYIMA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I, therefore, re-echo that there is a need to entirely change the PDM from the way it is being implemented. We propose, as the alternative government, that we should have a programme that is taking care of:(i) The different physical features of the country;(ii)  Our population sizes in the country; and(iii)  A model that looks at how this country has different activities as far as economics is concerned, and we look at the comparative advantage of each and every area and we are bringing forth Ubuntu, local government model. I beg to submit.THE SPEAKER: Thank you, Hon. Ethel, for your point of departure. Honourable members, in your point of departure, I expected you to pick the loopholes; the whole PDM is not bad. I wanted you to bring the alternative policy as an alternative government, on how the loopholes can be corrected, rather than bringing a total overhaul. Next time when you make an alternative statement, you bring the alternative policy that if you were the one in government, I would do A, B, C, D. You would change everybody into a money economy in one day and how do you do this? You would do A, B, C, and D. Thank you so much. Minister of Information. 5.32THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, AND NATIONAL GUIDANCE (Dr Chris Baryomunsi):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I want to make a small comment that the PDM is targeting Ugandan households that are in sub -sistence livelihood that stands at 39 per cent of Ugandan households and you cannot measure impact after one year for a programme. It requires at least three years going upward so it is unfair to say that PDM has not created an impact, yet it has just started. 12432MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONTHE SPEAKER: That is why I was asking after how long?DR BARYOMUNSI:  I beg my sister to be patient for the programme to be implemented, then you can measure whether it has an impact or not, but you cannot measure impact on the first day -(Interjection)-  I am just giving you technical advice. THE SPEAKER:  Thank you.  Minister of Local Government. 5.33THE MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr Raphael Magyezi):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I start by thanking the committee and its leadership. Thanks for a very good report. As a sector, we fully agree with the report and the recommendations. There are two or three things to highlight there, then I can give my comment on the minority report. The issue of allowing local governments to retain their local revenue. Parliament made its resolution. As a sector, we fully agree with Parliament on this matter. It does not make any economic sense to tell a local government in Kapchorwa, Bundibugyo. THE SPEAKER:  When you brought an amendment to the Public Finance Management Act, I thought it was a collective responsibility. So, go back to Cabinet and bring an amendment to the Public Finance Management Act. Not so Hon. Oboth? You first give Hon. Oboth the microphone. MR MAGYEZI:  Hon. Oboth is now the Minister for Defence and Veteran Affairs; he is a big man. In terms of these local revenues coming from Tororo to Kampala, he also agrees. You do not bring money from Tororo, bring it to the Treasury, look at it, and take it back. THE SPEAKER:  We have agreed we should have an amendment. MR MAGYEZI:  Secondly, on the issue of the new cities, I want to clarify. The current government ban is on the creation of new administrative units. The cities we are talking about; Moroto, Kabale, Nakasongola, Entebbe, and Wakiso, we are not talking about creating them, they were already created. I am talking about operationalising the units which were already created and we need a position from Parliament at this time because I am sure the Electoral Commission needs to be guided in terms of the way ahead. In terms of when they should be functional or when they start, it is the 1 July 2025. So it is not a requirement for this current budget in terms of funding them, what we now need is just Shs 1 billion shillings to carry out studies on the boundaries, on the revenue capacities and so on, which we shall then present to the Parliament. Thirdly, on the issue of ex-gratia  of the local councillors. Colleagues, it is an agreed position of Parliament and it is good practice to avoid a supplementary budget if we know that it will happen. Already we are telling you that there are some funds in terms of arrears and shortfalls in the budget to pay the councillors as ex-gratia  and it is coming to Shs 42 billion. When we do not include it in this year’s budget, we will create a supplementary budget even at the beginning. That is an important point we need to look at. Madam Speaker, we have prioritised physical planning because of increased urbanisation in the country. We need a fund for physical planning so that we have well-guided urbanisation in the country. We are requesting for only Shs 5 billion. Why are we bringing this and why did we bring them to the committee? They are considered at this stage as unfunded priorities and it is this House to appropriate and pronounce itself on this. I totally agree with the committee. We are going to issue a circular to all local governments to ensure that they include a ramp for persons with disabilities on their buildings. Thank you for bringing that out; it is really important. SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORTS12433THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024Madam Speaker, on the issue of the minority report, I have listened very carefully. It is an important point she is making because if we say that the Parish Development Model is not delivering, you are then saying that even the budget for PDM should be excluded. I have looked at the arguments made by my colleague, the honourable Shadow Minister of Local Government. First, she says there were some inadequacies in other Government programmes, aimed at improving the livelihood of the people. Therefore, PDM is also likely to face the same challenge. I beg to disagree because PDM has had a different design and preparatory activities. It is people-owned; the funds are going directly to the people and stay with the people. It is directly funded, in that the money goes from the Treasury to the SACCO accounts. When we look at the performance so far, the achievements attest to the efficiency of PDM. You gave us Shs 1.1 trillion last financial year. We have disbursed all of it, except for Shs 20 billion. For a performance of 98 per cent for such a programme across the whole country, give it its credit in the first year. We are now looking at effectiveness. How are the people who got the money using it? How is it transforming their lives? I think it is not good reasoning, but a bit fallacious to say that if one programme failed or did not perform properly, then the next one will certainly do the same. I do not agree with that. Secondly, the argument that the Shadow Minister of Local Government gives that PDM is devoid of transparency and accountability; that some of our officials were arrested for mismanagement of funds. I agree with that. In 2021, a number of local government officials were arrested and made to pay back. However, we learned from that and the system was changed. The money for PDM is no longer going through the Chief Administrative Officer or Town Clerk. It goes directly to the SACCO account and that has removed the bureaucracy and red tape at that level. When you look at the money lost - because it is not all rosy - even at the SACCO level, we have some irresponsible SACCO chairpersons. We are talking of a loss of about Shs 1.5 billion. When you look at a programme of Shs 1.1 trillion and you have a loss of Shs 1.1 billion, which is an error of 0.1 per cent, statistically, you cannot criticise that programme and say it should be scrapped. The third argument is that PDM is discriminatory, especially to the Muslims. Honourable colleagues that is a very important point. When you look at the explanation and guidelines we have given you, PDM is repaid after two years and you pay back the Shs 1 million which you borrowed with a top-up of six per cent. This is not a profit made by the beneficiary. It is a top-up to handle the administrative costs of the programme.When you look at the beneficiaries so far, you notice that Muslims have received as much as any other Ugandans have. I think it is a question of how we explain this to the people of Uganda. The other argument that the Shadow Minister of Local Government made is that the special interest groups; the women, the youth, persons with disabilities and the elderly are not receiving their quotas. That could have been at the beginning, but with intensive training and supervision, I confirm now that the situation is different. Remember, on the Parish Development Committee, there is a representative of each of these special interest groups, and they are very serious about their money. I see this, in terms of the figures because we have a daily tracker system and we look at how the money moves. We see increased uptake by women, youth and persons with disability. (Applause)Finally, you said that PDM is a one-size-fits-all, which is a very important point because it has come up again and again. We should maybe 12434MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONconsider different funding for parishes with bigger populations and acreage. (Applause)  Honourable colleagues, let us get back to the basics. Under PDM, we are talking about 39 per cent of households, which are still in subsistence. The parish may have a big population in terms of the size of the number of people, but it may have a lower percentage in terms of households in subsistence. (Applause)  This is statistical. For now, I think that we may need to look at other parameters –THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, listen to the minister. If you have those good ideas, that is why we have this debate. You will be able to give them to the minister to improve. He may not know what is in Buikwe because he comes from Igara. Do you get it? So, make those comparisons. MR MAGYEZI: Madam Speaker, as we move ahead - because this was the beginning; we had to start somewhere and we used the pro rata basis, that is the equal amount per parish. As we go ahead, we shall have a comprehensive formula that looks at geography, population, subsistence and so on. However, you say that the parishes and Kampala have a big population and yet it is proven statistically that most of these households are below 10 per cent, in terms of subsistence. I agree with you. We will have a comprehensive formula, but we had to start somewhere with the pro rata basis.I would like to propose to my colleague, the minister that the Ubuntu local government model she is proposing needs to be designed and conceptualised. Give it to us; we will pick the positive elements in the proposal so that we enrich the PDM. However, the PDM is succeeding; let all of us support it. Thank you, Madam Speaker. (Applause)THE SPEAKER: Honourable minister, we need a continuous review of the impact that PDM has created in the community. Whether we are getting positive or negative impacts, we need to do continuous assessment. Yes, Professor. 5.45PROF. ELIJAH MUSHEMEZA (Independent, Sheema County South, Sheema): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I thank the committee chairperson for a good report presented, but I have a few observations. The chairperson proposed that we need money for the officers who would be affected by rationalisation. I would like to know why the minister did not include this money in the current ceiling. This is because if it remains under unfunded priorities, we are heading for a crisis or we shall be attracting supplementary budgets, which this Parliament has been discouraging. It should be in the ceiling because this is very important. The second point is on duplication of the officers who are in service, but were in the category of retired officers. If you are a Vice-President, but served as a Prime Minister, I would have expected the committee to show, in the current proposals, whether we have such monies for those officers who are still in service and a proposal that that money should go to other priorities. If the law bars us from doing that, then let us amend the law immediately, so that such money can be utilised. I would have expected – THE SPEAKER: Professor, if I heard the Chairperson well, you may have noticed that he said that for instance, if you have been a Speaker and you become a Vice President, you will have double pension, which is illegal. Therefore, that law must be amended; you should not benefit from both offices, but only one, whichever is higher. PROF. MUSHEMEZA : That is true, but in the current proposal, do we have a scenario where a serving officer is about to benefit from such an illegality? [Mr Mapenduzi] SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORTS12435THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024THE SPEAKER: It is not about, whether they are benefitting. PROF. MUSHEMEZA : Then we should amend the law immediately so that we save such a duplication. I attended a public meeting where His Excellency the President said that he had directed the Ministry of Local Government to come up with a proposal for discussion on how we can improve the payments for the LC I chairpersons and other leaders. Now that the Minister is here, what is cooking in the kitchen to have that proposal to remunerate LCI chairpersons and other leaders? Finally - THE SPEAKER: Finally, Professor -     PROF. MUSHEMEZA : Finally, as a country, are we still interested in decentralisation? Because for a simple activity like coming up with a new bank account, you need approval from the Accountant-General according to the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA). Amending the PFMA in piecemeal and leaving out the critical issues, which undermine decentralisation means that we are killing decentralisation and re-centralising day by day. Thank you. THE SPEAKER: Thank you. Hon. David Kabanda and then Dr Samuel Cuti. 5.48MR DA VID KABANDA (NRM, Kasambya County, Mubende): Thank you, Madam Speaker for this opportunity, the committee Chairperson and members for the good report. On 14 November 2023 - I am now on the issue of the five remaining cities, Hon. Raphael Magyezi said, “The fate of the five new cities remains unclear after a decision of the court that was delivered three years ago”, Mr Magyezi said, “It is because of this ruling that we do not operationalise new units in the middle of the term.” He said, “It is not about money, but the law.” The same Hon. Magyezi was heard today requesting for some money to start the process of operationalising the new cities. However –(Interjections)- the Masaka High Court Judge, Mr Moses Kawumi Kazibwe, on 27 October 2020, agreed with the petitioners and ruled that the Local Government Act empowers the Minister of Local Governments to issue guidelines on matters in his jurisdiction through a statutory instrument and not by pronouncements delivered at a press conference. Consequently, Hon. Magyezi indicated that the five new cities remain on hold. The Minister did not respond to questions about whether he would be issuing the necessary instrument giving effect to the five urban units following the court decision. The clarification I am seeking is whether Hon. Magyezi has tabled the statutory instrument and the guidelines before he promises those cities to begin in 2025. I beg to submit. THE SPEAKER: Yes, Hon. Magyezi. MR MAGYEZI: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Thank you, Hon. David Kabanda for those observations – (Interjections) -  it is not speculation, these are observations. First of all, what did the court rule in the case quoted and good enough amidst us is one of us who took the Government to court, Hon. Eddie Kwizera and the court ruled in his favour to the effect that the Government should not start new administrative units, mid-term. In addition, if you have listened carefully to the Committee Chairperson’s report, the request is not to start cities now. The report was to request for Shs 1 billion for preparatory activities. (Applause)  In line with that, these cities are not starting now. We did not present a budget for the new cities - THE SPEAKER: Do preparatory activities lead to the start-off? 12436MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONMR MAGYEZI: The preparatory activities I am talking about are studies by the ministry in terms of the boundaries, the revenue capacities and so on. For the administrative units, which were already created, remember, that we are talking of; we need to separate these two terms. The court said, do not create new administrative units, mid-term. These five cities were already created; it is now the mandate of the Parliament to pronounce itself and say, “We need to reverse the other resolution..” - [Hon. Eddie Kwizera rose]  - what I am requesting for now is - THE SPEAKER: There is a clarification from the chief petitioner. MR MAGYEZI: Just let me finish this one. I do not want to forget it – (Interjections) -  just give me one minute to finish this one because you raise an important matter. Madam Speaker, the five cities were already approved and gazetted by the Parliament. THE SPEAKER: Can I hear from the Attorney-General? Why are you struggling when there is a legal advisor? (Laughter) MR MAGYEZI: You are welcome. Thank you. 5.54THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr Jackson Kafuuzi):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. There are two cases, one of which the court ruled that the Minister of Local Government must table the statutory instrument instead of issuing guidelines in the media. However, prior to that, there had been a ruling, in the case filed by Hon. Eddie Kwizera. The court was very specific; it did not say that you should not start administrative units in the middle of the political term. It said that you do not hold elections for the elective positions that come because of the creation of those administrative units. What is envisaged in the Constitution is either a by-election or a general election. The question was when you create Kyegegwa City – (Interjections) -  I have forgiven my friend. When you create Kyegegwa City and you want to hold elections in 2025, the issue is: will that be a general election or a by-election? In answering that, the court said we cannot hold elections to fill political positions that arise as a result of the creation of new administrative units. Those elections must await a general election because that is what is envisaged in the Constitution. It is either a general election or a by-election. So, if the administrative unit is to start in 2025, what would happen would be administrative structures. The budgeting and movement of this and that would be for administrative structures, but the actual election must await a general election, to fill the elective positions. I beg to submit. THE SPEAKER:  The regulations? Hon. Oboth Oboth, were the regulations laid? 5.57THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND VETERAN AFFAIRS (Mr Jacob Oboth):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. This Parliament made the law – actually, actualised that similar decision by amending the Local Government Act and now it is part of our laws, that you cannot – I think that is what the Attorney-General was shy to say. It is a question of law now – even just starting with the administrative aspect. The moment you mention budgeting – you cannot do budgeting without political oversight. It is a law and I think that we need to embrace it or refresh our minds that when we were passing these electoral reforms with Hon. Mpuuga Mathias, my good friend – and many of you who were privileged to be in the last Parliament with the Rt Hon. Speaker. We passed that here during the electoral reforms and it is now part of our legislative framework. THE SPEAKER:  Have you concluded? (Laughter)  Hon. Oboth, have you concluded? SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORTS12437THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024MR OBOTH: No, I thought I was speaking to lawmakers. THE SPEAKER: No, but you need to conclude. MR OBOTH:  The conclusion is that we have a law. (Laughter)THE SPEAKER:  Yes. At least you have done it. (Laughter)MR MAGYEZI:  Madam Speaker, Hon. Oboth is right. THE SPEAKER:  The guidelines? Did you bring the guidelines that you were supposed to lay on Table? MR MAGYEZI:  I hope the Members will recall when I brought a draft regulation and the guidance we got from the Attorney-General was that the Local Government Act was adequate, except in areas where we may need amendment, which we shall do. Right now what we need is the Shs 1 billion for preparatory activities, leading towards the cities in January 2026. THE SPEAKER:  Is it a priority? MR MAGYEZI:  That is for Parliament, Madam Speaker.THE SPEAKER: Dr Acuti? 6.00DR SAMUEL OPIO (Independent, Kole North County, Kole):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I thank the committee for the report. I would like to seek clarification from the Minister of Public Service on the Shs 74 billion that is unfunded, to provide for the RAPEX expenditure. When we had the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) being transferred to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development – and the Ministry of Science and Technology: there were a number of staff  who were to be transferred to other facilities. Now, it has taken almost more than –THE SPEAKER:  Why don’t you bring that under energy – REA? You speak about the ones that are going to be under local government. DR OPIO:  Under the savings of the Bill, they have provided for some who are going to be paid their terminal benefits, but there is also a second category of those who will be absorbed or transferred to other ministries. However, I have not seen that being provided for within the budget and that is going to create a challenge, because if it goes beyond this financial year, then, they are going to have the same issues we had before: salaries in arrears. Secondly, I want the Minister of Local Government to clarify – THE SPEAKER:  Maybe to all the ministers, all the entities that are going to be merged, where we are going to have RAPEX, we must make a provision for payment of people who are not going to be absorbed. All that must be provided for. It is a priority. DR OPIO:  Madam Speaker, the issue was also on the salaries for those who are going to be absorbed. The challenge last time was that the agency would have been disbanded, but the people would be hanging in the air and not absorbed and the issues of salary arrears would come up. Secondly, to the Minister of Local Government, we want to know whether LC I elections are going to be held. We extended their term, but we have not had much information about that. Lastly, on the issue of –THE SPEAKER:  On the LC I elections, we shall still extend them. That is not a priority. DR OPIO:  The last one is the issue of Kampala Metropolitan. I want to understand: that in light of the five new cities you have talked about, specifically Wakiso, we know that there is the Ministry for Kampala Capital City Authority and Metropolitan Affairs, which also includes Wakiso.12438MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONI want to know whether the “metropolitan” is under a statutory instrument – whether they are going to coexist with Wakiso City or whether one will supersede the other. Entebbe, too. Thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Santa and then Hon. Ojok.6.03MS SANTA OKOT (PPP, Aruu North County, Pader):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I thank the committee for the good report. However, on one of the pages, the committee chairperson read that there could be funding to be allocated for subcounties that were relocated due to the creation of the cities and the town councils. I want to bring to their attention and that of the minister that it is not only about the subcounties that were relocated due to the coming into being of the cities. We have many subcounties that were created from the mother subcounties, which are operating under trees. Some of them are operating in kiosks. So, I would wish to think that they should incorporate and add them so that they also get development funds. The second issue is that I would like to find out from the minister –THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Okot some of those subcounties are working under the verandas. Where a subcounty was separated from another, you find that they have no office, so, that is a very serious matter. MS SANTA OKOT:  Madam Speaker, in Aruu North, I have about five subcounties, which are operating under trees. We have Bongtiko, Acholibur, Paula, Pot Ogali and Ajan. Leave alone that one, these subcounties do not get community access road funds to help them to repair the subcounty roads. That means the districts should use the funds they have to develop those subcounties’ roads. The second thing I want the minister to take note of is that District Service Commissions in all districts, maybe not only mine, always recruit these staff, but leave them in acting capacities and in very key offices such as human resources, district health office and the education department. This makes the work not to move on properly. Finally, in future, we need to begin thinking about the women’s councils. As we recognise the LCs I and give them ex-gratia, the women councils keep on asking us because the chairpersons are supposed to move in subcounties. They do not have bicycles or motorcycles. We need to begin thinking about them so that they get some small ex-gratia to move around and help the women in the community. Thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. Hon. Magyezi, where do the VHTs belong? Health? These also need to be supported with bicycles. Hon. Ojok?6.06MR ANDREW OULANYAH  (NRM, Omoro County, Omoro):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to thank the chairperson of the committee for the report. I have three observations, Madam Speaker. One, on the issue of ex-gratia, I want to appreciate the committee for the proposal, especially regarding the arrears. However, even for what has been planned in the IPF, for example, in Omoro there is a shortage. In the previous years, they gave Shs 172 million, but in this year, they are giving Shs 44 million. I would like them to just take note of that because some errors keep cropping up. Second, on the issue of the Road Fund under Community Access Roads (CAR), I would like to request. The last time we raised this issue about new administrative units, it was an issue of coding. I hope that the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development has completed the issue of coding those new administrative units so that they can also get funding. In addition, there are some old subcounties like Ongako and Koro that have not been receiving the CAR funds for the last two financial years. [Dr Opio] SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORTS12439THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024Third, there is the issue of transitional grants. It is very discretionary. May I propose that we have a definite figure per year for these new administrative units. We know that for every subcounty or district, per year we have this particular amount. It could be Shs 500 million until those units are up and running. Thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you. When we are looking at this, let us not personalise it to constituencies or districts. Let it be general like the contracts of LCIs will be renewed in 2026. Let it not be only for the ones of Bukedea or whichever. 6.08MS DORCAS ACEN  (NRM, Woman Representative, Alebtong):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would like to appreciate the detailed report from the committee chairperson and also some very critical aspects, which are positive, from the alternative report from the shadow minister. I want to bring to the attention of the minister that whereas we know that the PDM is doing well and we have very good hopes that it will be a game changer, there are some aspects we do not look at critically. For example, when we say that money goes directly to the SACCOs, we also know that we have information, which has already indicated that sometimes money under the Wendi Digital Platform is going directly to personal accounts, which is not the SACCO’s account. This is up to a tune of Shs 100 million. That can be quite risky.Even when we are already praising the 98 per cent in terms of disbursement, as women we know that when we were praising Uganda Women Empowerment Programme (UWEP) performance was going beyond 90 per cent, for example, when we visited some districts in northern Uganda like Agago, at 93 per cent; that was already based on the recovery rate. Therefore, when we begin to say that we are performing at 98 per cent, I think that gives us a leeway to just sit back when we still do not know how the Fund is – (Member timed out.)6.10MR JAMES MAMAWI  (NRM, Adjumani East County, Adjumani):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I also want to thank the committee for the report presented.Aware that the committee brings out the issue of emoluments for the local government leaders, one of the biggest challenges we have is that of the subcounty vice chairpersons. Their roles are very clear that in the absence of the chairperson, they take over. In the event of uncertainties like death arising, the vice chairperson acts as a chairperson of the subcounty. However, the vice is not entitled to any salary that the chairperson has been getting. Madam Speaker, my request is that the committee takes an interest that if the law can be amended to cater for such, we shall be glad. Two, I got an opportunity to move to some of these cities like Fort Portal, Mbarara and Masaka – (Member timed out.)6.11MR PETER OKOT  (DP, Tochi County, Omoro):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I thank the committee for the good report. I just have one observation on which I would need clarification from the Minister of Public Service. In the report, there is where the Public Service Commission is requesting for some amount of money to put up a commission’s house. We also know that Government is coming up with a campus at Bwebajja, where all the ministries and agencies will be housed. Will that not be a duplication or is Government putting up that one for only ministries and leaving out the agencies?Second, I support the committee’s recommendation for vehicles for political leaders. It is a big challenge in many districts where chairpersons do not have vehicles. They end up picking vehicles from the sectors and you find that the technical staff are left with nothing to do supervision and carry out their work. Therefore, I support the recommendation 12440MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONthat political leaders be given their procured vehicles.Finally, on PDM, I think a lot of emphasis was put – (Member timed out.)6.13DR MICHAEL BAYIGGA-LULUME  (DP, Buikwe County South, Buikwe): Thank you, Madam Speaker. I thank the committee for the report. I would like to bring it to the attention of Parliament that we do not know the exact number of parishes that we have, let alone their names.THE SPEAKER:  Who doesn’t know? Yourself or the Executive?DR BAYIGGA LULUME:  I am very serious about this one, Madam Speaker.THE SPEAKER:  No, I am saying, the honourable Minister of Local Government is here. Has he said he does not know?6.14THE MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT  (Mr Raphael Magyezi):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. We have 10,594 parishes and I have a compendium of all local government administrative units, which I can lay on the Table even this week. Thank you. DR BAYIGGA LULUME  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I now know that he has that compendium, but my consultations had not met people who were wiser than that. Now that we know that there is such a compendium, we would like to own it by having it laid on the Table. Why I am saying this –THE SPEAKER:  We have a copy in the library. The unfortunate bit we have with our Members like Dr Lulume is that after here, he dashes to the hospital. He does not go to the library to research on what to say next.DR BAYIGGA LULUME  Madam Speaker, this is a serious matter because I read many books in the library.THE SPEAKER:  No, we have it in the library.DR BAYIGGA LULUME  Thank you very much. I will check for it. What I wanted to bring to the attention of Parliament too, is that if you gloss over the numbers and the names of such administrative units where expenditure is made, you can also be likely to get ghost parishes. I wanted this Parliament to take this seriously. Secondly, the honourable minister talked about a new formula of which timeline has not been given. We brought this matter to the attention of the minister even when he came to Buikwe South Constituency. When we are talking about population versus allocation, it means inequity for those overpopulated areas with poor people, yet there are certain administrative units with fewer people who are – (Member timed out.)THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Mourine Osoru?6.16MS MOURINE OSORU (NRM, Woman Representative, Arua City):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I thank the Chairperson for the wonderful report. However, I have two concerns about the road units. Indeed, the newly created cities have been having challenges with these road units. We need to open up roads. Our cities still look like how they were when they were still districts. Madam Speaker, if I have not forgotten, in the last financial year, I remember we passed money for the road units. Even the Minister of Works and Transport himself stated here that procurements were ongoing for these road units. He said 80 per cent had been achieved, and only 20 per cent was remaining. THE SPEAKER:  I want you to keep that question for infrastructure. Because that was brought in infrastructure; the money for road units was available and the procurement had started. We need to find out where it has reached. [Mr Okot] SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORTS12441THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024MS OSORU:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. On the issue of office space, we have been coexisting with our mother districts; the mother districts are still operating within the newly created cities’ offices. Arua City recruited staff  that need space and the mother district staff are also still in Arua City. Now, we have staff who are meandering around and we do not know where to put them. Madam Speaker, when the committee stated that we need money for office space. I was very grateful because -THE SPEAKER:  It is a priority, honourable minister. Hon. Nathan?6.18MR NATAHAN BYANYIMA (NRM, Bukanga North County, Isingiro):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I wish to appreciate the Parish Development Model (PDM). At my age, I had never heard of a trillion going to the villages. It is a very big achievement and what we should do is to nurse this baby. A partnership with the Ministry of Local Government so that the money can reach every person.When he talks of the size of the parishes, I agree, some are bigger than others. That is why; I would think that, much as he wants money to administrate the cities, it is also good to know about our districts. There are bigger districts like Tororo, Kasese, Ntungamo, and Isingiro. If the minister could have his technical people go and see those districts, rather than people coming here on the floor - I am forming this district- And are not very informed. Two, about public service - unfortunately, the committee has said that Shs 76 billion is required for the Rationalisation of Agencies and Public Expenditure (RAPEX). When we met the Minister of Works, he said he wanted Shs 174 billion for only, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA).  So, this thing you are taking in Hon. Muruli-Mukasa -THE SPEAKER:  Which UNRA, the one that is going to be repealed?MR BYANYIMA:  Yes, when they came to the committee minister was asked, how much would you need to pay off those people and continue with UNRA business as a department? He said Shs 174 billion, but UNRA was talking of Shs 202 billion. So the figure of Shs 76 is just a pure lie to make these young people and men suffer on the street.I would want people to do some bit of logistical and scientific study before they do something. We are going in this one without being well informed. I do not see why we should continue as if we never went to school. We are all knowledgeable people. Why should we take policies that cannot work, Madam Speaker? We have continued on this issue of rationalisation, but we have not done good homework. We would want to see that if you are taking the coffee somewhere, we should see a department where it can fit and we continue having first-class coffee on the world market. But it is not there. People who have not been able to control foot and mouth you take -THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, the aspect of rationalisation is one. This House is the one that passed the Bills, which became Acts that created these institutions. It is still this House, to either accept or reject. But, you cannot also keep an institution that is only taking money. You should be able to keep an institution that makes money for the country.For instance, if you have an institution that is making funds for the country, why should you rationalise? But if you have a liability where you are continuing to pay people every day, sinking money on a daily basis, why shouldn’t you?MR BYANYIMA:  Most obliged, Madam Speaker, but I would have wanted a scientific study to inform this House-THE SPEAKER:  And I am happy you are the one who chaired the committee of that rationalisation. 12442MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONMR BYANYIMA:  But my report was ignored.THE SPEAKER:  By who? MR BYANYIMA:  By honourable minister Mururi-Mukasa. Because we never debated it. I thank you, Madam Speaker. THE SPEAKER:  No! Nobody ignored it. That is a report of the Parliament of Uganda, not your personal.6.23MR NATHAN NANDALA-MAFABI (FDC, Budadiri County West, Sironko):  Madam Speaker, I am happy that Hon. Byanyima is raising this issue of rationalisation. However, he should also look at the genesis of how they came up. I just want to ask you a question. If I am an engineer in the Ministry of Works, earning Shs 800,000, and you are an engineer in the Road Agency Formation Unit (RAFU) earning Shs 10 million. And I was brighter than you in class. Is that rational? Madam Speaker, we should not leave institutions, which are killing ministries. For the first time when we were forming these things, I told them that tomorrow it was going to be a monster. Let me give an example of UNRA. It started as RAFU, first of all, it started as an agency because they wanted to manage money from donors so that it should not go into the ministries. Then after that, they decided to make an authority.They have been making a road in Garuga, but it has failed up to now. This is just a procurement entity -THE SPEAKER:  We have shifted to RAPEX? Hon. Akol is -6.23MR ANTHONY AKOL (FDC, Kilak North County, Amuru):  Madam Speaker, I do not even see the Chairperson. He presented a very good report and everybody appreciated him. I have been attentively listening to Members. I know this report is going to the Budget Committee. Again, the same report is coming back from the Budget Committee to the Floor of Parliament, for a discussion. I wish we reduced the discussion. And move to another entity. Thank you, Madam Speaker.THE SPEAKER:  Thank you, honourable members. What I saw pertinent in this report is an aspect of duplication on the issue of pension. You should be able to get a pension from one entity other than getting it from several offices when it comes to - then when we look at all that is happening, honourable minister, you have heard the issue of offices is very important for these newly created administrative units and ministries. We need to look at all of that. As we said before, we are going to send this to the Committee of Budget for harmonisation and reconciliation. The chairperson will follow it up. I now put the question that the report of the Committee of Public Service and Local Government on the Ministerial Policy Statement and Budget Estimates for Financial Year 2024/2025 be adopted by this honourable House. (Question put and agreed to.)Report adopted.COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRSTHE SPEAKER:  Hon. Magyezi, do not take these issues for granted. They are very serious. This is a very good report because it informs you of what is happening in your ministry.  6.26MR JONATHAN ODUR (UPC, Erute County South, Lira):  Thank you, Madam Speaker. The point I wanted to make is for the Budget Committee. Once Parliament has adopted the committee recommendations, they become resolutions of the House. SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORTS12443THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024The Committee on Budget cannot sit again and censor what we have already passed here. Their work is to sieve and put together, not to start subjecting the chairperson or the minister – because we have been doing this in the past. Madam Speaker, I request you to emphasise it so that the Committee on Budget does not drag us back.THE SPEAKER:  Of course, the Committee on Budget works within the resource envelope that they have.MR NANDALA-MAFABI:  We have no problem with them working within the resource envelope. However, they should not go and start making their own adjustments as if they are in the House. The Committee on Budget should respect – THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, these reports are going to the Committee on Budget for harmonisation, reconciliation and consolidation, based on other factors . Why are you against Hon. Mudimi? Hon. Nathan – MR NANDALA-MAFABI:  Minister of Local Government, the reason why there is poor performance in local governments is because councillors are not underpaid or given nothing. Now, instead of doing their work, they go for a contract for road construction so that they can get money to sustain themselves. This thing of saying 2025/2026 is too far - if we want local governments to perform, Parliament should appropriate money to deal with them so that these councillors and chairpersons are paid something other than not doing – Hon. Nambeshe was once LC V Chairman, but because of poor pay, he contested and became a Member of Parliament. (Laughter)  THE SPEAKER:  The committee chairperson, Hon. Mapenduzi, was the LC V Chairman for 15 years.MR NANDALA-MAFABI:  Madam Speaker, that is why we are saying that the earlier we handle this issue, the better. You are deferring the development of an area by pushing it to Financial Year 2025/2026. We want these councillors to participate in monitoring roads, streets, hospitals and schools. Let us appropriate some money for them. If we give them money, you are going to see service delivery in local governments. ( Applause) MR MAGYEZI:  Madam Speaker, Hon. Nandala-Mafabi, raises a very pertinent issue. It is good for Members of Parliament to see our proposal. Honourable colleagues, as we stand today, the LC 1 Chairperson is paid Shs 10,000 per month –(Interjections)-  Yes, how? That is a right question, but it is the reality. It is so little that we cannot pay it every month; so, we pay it annually Shs 120,000. It makes it look like it is something, but that is what it is. The same applies to the LC II chairpersons. A councillor of a subcounty gets Shs 35,000 – [Mr Eddie Kwizera: “Procedure.”] -  The LC III chairperson – but this is for the information of Members.THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, first, you should not switch on a microphone and say “procedure” .Second, Members of Parliament are wondering, when they go to their constituencies and all the councillors together with other people come to them are asking, what the problem is and how best this can be solve them. (Applause)MR MAGYEZI:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. Honourable colleagues, let us have this information so that as you meet these councillors, and they cry before you – a chairperson of a district has ever shed tears before me. LC III Chairperson of a subcounty or town council is paid Shs 380,000, and he is supposed to be full-time in office.The district councillor is paid Shs 175,000. Honourable colleagues, these members also go for campaigns like us. The chairperson of a district is paid Shs 1.7 million. So, what are we proposing?12444MOTION FOR A RESOLUTIONThat is the figure the committee put in the report and I thank you for approving it. We are saying that if we increase salary for LC I and LC II chairpersons from Shs 10,000 to at least Shs 50,000 per month, and if we increase for LC III and LC V by 100 per cent, it will total Shs 378 billion, including what was already paid. That is what we are asking for. I think the Members are making a good point. If Parliament has approved this, let nobody tamper with it. I thank you, Madam Speaker. THE SPEAKER:  There is a procedural matter from Hon. Kibalya. MR KIBALYA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. We are in a very critical situation. My procedural matter is that every issue finds itself in your office. All these people complaining, these councillors suffering and everybody will be running to your office. When we are processing this budget – THE SPEAKER:  Including all Members; they come running saying, “Donation, donation.” (Laughter) So, why don’t we solve this problem once and for all? MR KIBALYA:  Madam Speaker, I request, if it is within your mandate, that before we finalise the budget, maybe you hold a very serious meeting with the ministers and the chairpersons of these committees. You dedicate time and get some of these issues because some chairpersons would wish to have some issues sorted, but the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development will be at a distance and the Minister of Local Government will be the other side. If you could hold them together and have a thorough discussion so that by the time we have the budget processed, we have a final position. THE SPEAKER: All the committee chairpersons are ex-officio members of the Budget Committee. My work is to sit there and supply. I do not want to be seen interfering with the budget. However, whatever has been said should be captured and considered. MR KIBALYA:  Madam Speaker, maybe just to harmonise –(Interruption)  MR NANDALA-MAFABI:  Madam Speaker, these are your committees. You cannot allow them to do things contrary to what we have agreed. If your committee is not doing what has been approved, then it is dangerous. THE SPEAKER:  We will handle them.MR NANDALA-MAFABI:  Madam Speaker, we plead with you, do not leave your order because you are the presiding officer. You are supposed to be the Chairperson, but because you do not have time, that is why they chose Hon. Kwizera to be the chairperson and he is working on your behalf. THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, can we agree on one thing? Before we supply, we will have a meeting with all the committee chairpersons, the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, the PSST, the relevant ministers of those committees and the accountants in the boardroom. (Applause)  Is that okay? [Members: “Yes.”]MR EDDIE KWIZERA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I have tried to read the total number of -THE SPEAKER:  Members, whether you talk for how long we are going to the next sector. From Thursday, we shall be sitting from 10:00 a.m.MR EDDIE KWIZERA: The total estimates in the policy statement and the Appropriation Bill have a variation. So, if we approve and adopt these reports of about Shs 60 trillion, yet the Appropriation Bill talks about Shs 58 trillion. Yesterday, a corrigenda was issued, wouldn’t it be procedurally right for the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to provide some guidance because there are three conflicting figures presented to the House, thank you.THE SPEAKER:  Hon. Eddie Kwizera that is why I said at the beginning that this was going [Mr Magyezi] SECTORAL COMMITTEE REPORTS12445THE ELEVENTH PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA TUESDAY , 9 APRIL 2024to be for harmonisation, reconciliation and consolidation. In the process of harmonising, that is when you will come up with one uniform figure. Committee on Foreign Affairs - thank you, chairperson of the Committee on Local Government and the minister for that elaborate report. 6.36THE CHAIRPERSON, COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Ms Norah Bigirwa):  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for the opportunity to present the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the ministerial policy statements for V otes 006 for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and V otes 501 to V otes 538, Ugandan Missions Abroad for the Financial Year 2024/2025. I am going to strictly take your guidance when coming up with a summary. However, we complied with your guidance. We held Zoom meetings with the missions and held physical meetings with some of the heads of missions and foreign service staff. We scrutinised the alternative ministerial policy statements on the foreign affairs sector from the Office of the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament and also went ahead – (Interruption)MR EDDIE KWIZERA:  Thank you, Madam Speaker. It is a good practice that we present and receive reports when the sector ministers are there. I have observed that the Minister of Foreign Affairs is neither here nor the Ministers of State. Wouldn’t it be procedurally right that we proceed with those who have their reports and skip those? THE SPEAKER:  I saw the minister. Where is he?MR EDDIE KWIZERA:  He is not here. THE SPEAKER:  Where is the Minister of Foreign Affairs? MS NALUYIMA:  Madam Speaker, much as it is what we agreed, it cannot stop us from receiving the report. THE SPEAKER:  Honourable members, the issue raised by Hon. Eddie Kwizera is very important. We need to have both the shadow –(Interjections) - where? - (Applause)  – actually, it is only the shadow minister. We need to have both the minister and the shadow minister for that sector. I would like to appreciate the ministers that are here –(Applause) - and my young brother, Hon. Jacob Oboth, congratulations for growing big. However, to the ministers who are not here. Do not take Members of Parliament for granted. We cannot sit here expecting to get your reports, but you just disappear like that. We are seated here because we have a statutory deadline. The statutory deadline is the 20th. We have only looked at two ministerial statements so far. What will happen? When we complain, they are the first to run to the Cabinet: “These Speakers-.” We shall – we are going to adjourn the House to Thursday at 10.00 a.m. and we are going to start - first sit -  sitting even on Fridays. The House is adjourned to Thursday, 11 April, 2024 at 10.00 a.m. (The House rose at 6.42 p.m. and adjourned until Thursday, 11 April 2024 at 10.00 a.m.)
