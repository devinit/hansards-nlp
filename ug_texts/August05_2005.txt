Parliament met at 11.45 a.m. in Parliament House, Kampala.

(The Speaker, Mr Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi, in the Chair.)

PRAYERS

The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you. I regret the delayed start of our proceedings today. This was because we had an Appointments’ Committee meeting to consider the nomination of a Supreme Court Judge, which was very urgent and could not wait.  

BILLS
COMMITTEE STAGE

THE CONSTITUTION
(AMENDMENT NO.3) BILL, 2005

11.47
THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, I am sorry to communicate this during Committee Stage but I have received a letter from hon. Bwerere Kasole Lwanga’s family (MP Buwekula County, Mubende) to the effect that he has suffered a lapse of his cerebral ailment over the weekend. Unfortunately the medical personnel found his condition so bad that surgery was the only alternative, at Cure Clinic, Mbale. I have rung Mbale and they say he is making considerable progress. Please, pray for him.

Clause 19

THE CHAIRMAN: We are considering clause 19, which was stood over.  

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, clause 19 proposed the substitution of Article 63 of the Constitution on electoral constituencies in Uganda. I have done consultations and I propose that clause 19 be deleted from the Bill. The mischief caused by the mushrooming of constituencies can be addressed under the Article 63 and the Parliamentary Elections Act. I propose that clause 19 be deleted from the Bill.

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, this proposed amendment was to address that mischief. Now that there is a new reflection, we have no problem with that proposal. 

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourables members, the position is: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 108. The ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

THE SPEAKER: We should consider clause 21 next, however, honourable minister, I see clause 20 on your list; didn’t we deal with that? Is it 21 or 20? Was it stood over?

Clause 20

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, clause 20(a) was stood over because I had not circulated the text. I have now rectified this. In this amendment what we propose is to deal with Article 71 and renumber the current provision to be 71(1) and to introduce 71(2) to read thus; “Parliament shall by law prescribe a Code of Conduct for Political Organisations and Political Parties to provide for the establishment of the National Consultative Forum to Political Parties and Organisations.  Such functions as Parliament may prescribe, including the resolution of disputes among political parties and political organisations”.  

We think that the code of conduct for the political parties and organisations is justified and that the National Consultative Forum will be in the national interest for coordination and stabilisation of political arrangements, especially under the Multi-party political system. I beg to move.

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, the committee accepts the proposal by the minister except that we ask him to clarify on the last part, on the use of the phrase “among political parties.” What does it mean? What would be the implication of this?

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, I am proceeding on the assumption that we will have more operators in these categories than just two, and I think that there will always be more than two. If I were sure there would be only two of them, I would remain at “between”. 

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, is it clear?

MR AWORI: Mr Chairman, all along some of us have been questioning the role and mechanism of this National Consultative Forum. I want to hear more from the Attorney-General on the mechanism, the functions and roles. 

DR MAKUBUYA: I was also quite interested in the role and functions of the National Consultative Forum. But one of the criticisms, which has been levelled against the Constitution makers in Uganda, is that we have tended to put too much detail in the Constitution. The Constitution should be a statement of broad principles, and the details can be worked out in the enabling laws. This is why this amendment is saying, “Parliament shall, by law prescribe the Code of Conduct …”.  Parliament will provide for the establishment of the National Consultative Forum, which will prescribe its functions and structures to avoid detail in the Constitution. I think this is the proper approach. I would like to appeal to hon. Awori to accept this formulation, to avoid too much detail in the Constitution.

MR AWORI: Mr Chairman, once again I am not opposing it, but as the Attorney General said we have been putting too much detail in the Constitution. What if you became silent about it?

THE CHAIRMAN: Any other comment?

MR SEBAGGALA: Mr Chairman, I would like to request the Minister to throw more light on the last sentence, especially where it says, “including the resolution of disputes among political parties and political organizations.” How will this August House resolve disputes? I believe this would have been done by the Constitutional Court and not this House.  

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, we are not saying that Parliament should resolve disputes among the parties, all we are saying is that Parliament should provide for the setting up of this mechanism, which will resolve disputes among the parties. And this mechanism will not prevent people from going to court but if you think about it critically you will find that this would be like the forum for first resort. Let people sit down and discuss matters of national interest in this forum and if they disagree the courts are always open to them. But give yourself an opportunity to discuss. This has not been the case. I know it is new, everybody has been doing it his own way but this is a new dispensation. I thank you.

MR WANDERA: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. I appreciate the need for political parties to come together and consider important national issues for the stability of the country but in light of Article 29(1)(e), which guarantees the right to associate, I take it that a mandatory provision requiring parties to come together and associate may infringe on this right because what the forum is doing –(Interjection)- hon. Eriyo, you will have an opportunity to express yourself, do not come here to boo me –(Interruption)

MS ERIYO: Mr Chairman, I have said nothing. I have been consulting the Constitution and I have not even called hon. Wandera’s name. I am wondering why he calls my name and makes such allegations against me. Is he in order?

THE CHAIRMAN: Well, can you substantiate, hon. Wandera? Is hon. Eriyo the only one behind you?

MR WANDERA: Mr Chairman, I think rule 53 of our Rules of Procedure is very clear that members, including myself, will be heard in silence. So, I now put it to you whether it is in order for her to continue making unseemly interruptions when a member is contributing.

THE CHAIRMAN: No, the position was that she had said nothing. That was her assertion. Therefore, she had not –(Interruption)

MR WANDERA: I take it that she is coining a new definition for “saying nothing”.  

THE CHAIRMAN: Well, I asked you to substantiate. Therefore, if you cannot then I think it was out of order.

MR WANDERA: She was interrupting me.

THE CHAIRMAN: Since you could not substantiate and having named her without being able to substantiate, it was not proper for you to say Eriyo when there were many others. Proceed.

MR WANDERA: Most obliged, Mr Chairman. The point that I am making is that the creation of a consultative forum will require different political parties to associate with one another and what Article 29(1)(e) does is that it gives me the right to determine who I can associate with or who I may not associate with. My worry is that will we not, by doing this, be infringing on the rights under Article 29(1)(e)? That is the clarification that I want.

THE CHAIRMAN: I think the clarification that he wants is, why do you create this when there is a right of association? However, the point here is that there may be misunderstandings arising simply because these organizations have not met to work out the differences. The provision is now giving you an opportunity for these parties to come together and say, “But why are you doing this, why are you interfering with me when I go and hold meetings.  Why do you threaten my people; can we not stop this?” I think that is the purpose of this consultation. It does not infringe on you remaining in your party but where there is a problem, how do you solve it? That is how I understand this. Hon. Wandera, that is the purpose.  

MR GAGAWALA: Mr Chairman, when this law is passed it is saying, “Parliament shall by law prescribe a code of conduct ….” What is worrying me is, the Attorney-General did not provide for the timetable because when he says, “Parliament shall by law prescribe” and soon after this law is passed the parties are going to interface; they are going to become active. When will this mandatory theme be activated because immediately – I feel that we might end up with chaos just when this has passed because there must be a timetable for making sure that Parliament has put in place a mechanism for the parties not to go for each other’s throats after the whole system has been activated. That is an area where I feel I have got to be clarified by the Attorney-General. Why he did not indicate the timetable of activating that particular section?

THE CHAIRMAN: If you think there is a need to set the time you can yourself make that contribution and justify it but when you put a provision that Parliament shall make a law, it presupposes that Parliament will be efficient and will be diligent and make the law. If you think it is necessary to say within six months or one year, it is up to you to bring up that case and we consider it.  

CAPT. BABU: I would like to thank you very much, Mr Chairman. This mechanism is to create some sort of harmony in this new dispensation where we are going to have so many different parties and if anybody has got a complaint against one party or the other, you have a situation where you can have dialogue between two different groups and maybe resolve it there. If it fails then you can take it to the courts of law. Really it is basically to find harmony in management of these organizations that are going to be so many and I think it is happening in other countries. 

In most countries it is informal like in the United States you get bi-partisan situations, and in Britain. Here what we are trying to do is to now create a mechanism where we can easily go and sit down and have this – like I would meet hon. Wandera upstairs in the canteen and we have a small talk and create harmony. It is not a law. We are creating a situation and a mechanism and I think hon. Awori Aggrey, who is a very good friend of mine - we have met many times and resolved our issues, like we have been resolving issues of aeroplanes a few minutes ago. It is dialogue. Thank you very much.

MRS MATEMBE: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. I have no problem with this provision because it is here because of the background we are coming from. Therefore, I see no problem with it if it is going to help us move better. However, I would propose that you delete this whole phrase including the resolution of dispute among political parties and political organizations because it makes it a bit clumsy. We should say that, “Parliament shall by law prescribe a code of conduct for political organizations and political parties and provide for the establishment of a national consultative forum for political parties and organizations with such function as Parliament may prescribe.” That is the best. I would like you to delete this clumsy bit of the provision with which it can always be all right.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, so you are suggesting an amendment to cut certain –(Interruption)

DR MAKUBUYA: I accept the amendment.

THE CHAIRMAN: In that case let us vote on this provision to form part of the Bill, by roll call. 

MR WACHA: I am sorry, Sir. I am still having a slight problem. I have no basic problem with this provision but then I think if the whole purpose is the establishment of a consultative forum then let us direct our minds to that. Let us form the consultative forum and give it such functions as Parliament may provide them and we leave the establishment of the code of conduct as –(Interjections)- no, let me explain, please. Let us leave the establishment of the code of conduct to that forum. Parliament shall establish the forum and then such functions will include the establishment of the code of conduct. I do not know whether I am making myself clear? You give me time and talk to the Attorney-General and his deputy.

THE CHAIRMAN: No, hon. Wacha, the code and the consultative forum are two different things in that the consultative forum is for you parties having a chance to come and sit, talk about it and have a solution, but the code is mandatory that we must behave in a certain way. Therefore, it has no harm stating the conduct even if you may not want to participate in the affairs of consultative forum, but with the code you are bound. Things like going to the IDP camp and saying, “If you do not do this and the other …”; that is the type of thing we are talking about. How do you prevent a party exploiting the desperate position of people in the IDP camps to market your – there are two different things honourable member. It does no harm really. 

MR WACHA: Then we should not have formulated it this way. There should then be two different parts to this. We have one part dealing with the establishment of the code of conduct and another dealing specifically with the establishment of the consultative forum.   

DR MAKUBUYA: I am sorry, Mr Chairman, I do not understand the nature of the difficulty, which my colleague hon. Ben Wacha is facing. Parliament will prescribe a code of conduct for the political organizations and political parties. Parliament will also provide for the establishment of the National Consultative Forum, I do not think you can be clearer than this. There are two ideas and for purposes of parsimony we are covering them in one provision. They do not conflict; they compliment each other. I do not understand the problem.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, let us vote. There is a proposal to amend. It has been improved on by hon. Matembe by deleting certain parts of the formulation. 

MR LUKYAMUZI: Mr chairman, I need some clarification from the Attorney-General. I do not want to pass a rule, which I have not fully understood and internalised. As we move into a new dispensation we must be very clear on the issues. Would the Attorney-General let me know the difference between political parties and political organizations?

THE CHAIRMAN: You read the law on political parties and political organizations. Can we take the roll call?

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, thank you very much. While they are working on these figures, in the public gallery there are people from Wabirongo Church of Uganda Primary School in Ntenjeru County, Kayunga District represented by hon. Kefa Sempangi. You are welcome. (Applause)

And the position on clause 20(a) is: two abstentions, none against, and those for are 127. The ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 21

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, clause 21 sought to introduce provisions relating to the participation of candidates independently of political organizations or parties. I propose that this clause 21 be deleted from the Bill to stabilise that new political dispensation.

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, the committee had proposed that the intention of this particular clause -(Applause)- the status of the independent candidate has already been recognised by the Constitution in Article 83 1(g) and (h). Therefore, the proposal in this clause is to create a regime that is recognisable and bring it under the mandate of Parliament to regulate. We oppose the particular proposal for deletion. (Applause)

THE CHAIRMAN: Let us vote on the deletion of clause 21.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: The position on the motion to delete clause 21 is as follows: no abstentions, those for are 35, and those against are 65. Order, please! The noes have it.

(Question negatived.)

Clause 23

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question that clause 23 – no, we have to vote, sorry, we vote on the retention of clause 21. 

MR RUHINDI: Just a small matter, Mr Chairman. I do not know whether the chairman of the committee made this small correction. The one we are talking about is 21(b). It says, “By substituting clause 4, the following should be amended to add the following new clauses …” because we do not have clause 4 and 5 in the Constitution so we cannot be substituting, we are adding new clauses.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, I think it is okay. Honourable members, I put the question that clause 21 stand part of the Bill.

ABSTENTIONS:
1.	 MUTULUUZA PETER 

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the results of the vote on the retention of the proposed clause are as follows: one abstention, 34 against, and those for are 98. The ayes have it.

(Question agreed to.)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, although the gazetted time for Friday is 1.00 p.m., can we put in just one more hour?

Clause 23

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, I put the question that clause 23 stand part of the Bill.

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, I propose that clause 23(4), paragraph (d) be substituted so that after clause (3) you add the following (4) to say that: “Under the Multi-party political system, a public officer or a member of a commission, authority or committee established by the Constitution, who wishes to stand for election as a Member of Parliament, shall resign his or her office three months before nomination day.”  

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, we accept the proposal of the timeframe but we still urge Parliament to support the proposal by the committee, which was read here when the clause first came. If I can read it again it say: “Under the Multi-party political system, a public officer or a person working in any government department or agency of the Government or a member of a local council, government, or any body in which the Government has controlling interest, who wishes to stand for an election as a Member of Parliament, shall resign his or her office three months before nomination day.”  

THE CHAIRMAN: What is the difference between the committee’s proposal and yours?

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, what I see to be the difference between the Government proposal and the committee’s proposal is that the committee’s proposal is all embracing, all-inclusive; it captures almost everybody. Therefore, even sitting Members of Parliament will under that one have to resign before they can contest –(Interjections)- please, the chairman asked what I see to be the difference and I am stating what I see to be the difference.  “A public officer or a person working in any government department or agency of the Government or a member of a Local Council government or any body in which the Government has a controlling interest, who wishes …” – yes, we pass the committee’s version on the understanding that we are as many people as possible, including ourselves, so we were limiting the scope.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the Constitution of 1995 did not create any vacuum when the Executive is in existence and there is no Parliament. That is why you find that the time of Parliament is known, it is certain; Parliament gets dissolved when another one is taking over. So this cannot be mixed up with the other one. There is no time to allow the President to use ordinance to make laws for the country, so definitely anybody reading the other provision cannot say that this one covers an institution where there is no vacuum at any given time. So you cannot dissolve Parliament because there are going to be elections; Parliament will only expire when another one takes over. (Laughter) No, I was only explaining that and, therefore, for you to say that even this includes Parliament, which has to continue, then it causes a problem in interpretation of the Constitution.

MR KAKOOZA: Maybe the Attorney-General can tell us whether Members of Parliament are public officers whereas our lifespan is enshrined within the Constitution.

THE CHAIRMAN: What we have now are the two versions one of the committee and one by the minister. What do we do?

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, may I ask for time to harmonise with the committee?

MR KAGIMU: Mr Chairman, I am seeking clarification. When you say that somebody resigns it is as if you are instilling fear in civil servants not to risk. I think they should be taking leave because –(Interruption) 

THE CHAIRMAN: But is there anything to really reconcile? 

MS MEHANGYE: Mr Chairman, I just want to support what the minister is saying that in drafting we can harmonise the two: the position of the committee and that of the Government as long as we say the same things without including Parliament. (Laughter)

THE CHAIRMAN: No, honourable members, you should not give an impression that when you are dealing with this amendment you are subjective. What is required is to see the policy behind this design. Is it for political leaders or is it for the people who are working as public servants. Can you say that you resign when the institutions are to remain? There was a problem that was cured by not having a vacuum of Parliament; it is there. The Executive is in control when there is a Parliament so that we cannot give an excuse that because Parliament was not there that is why I did this and the other happened. Parliament is always there until another one comes in. Do we stand it over or –(Interruption)

MR KAWANGA: Mr Speaker, this is a matter, which we discussed before and it went to the two to harmonise. It appears they did not harmonise and we had better take one of the positions and go ahead; there is no need for us to go back on this matter. 

THE CHAIRMAN: Well, in this case as I see, I had asked you for an hour and it seems you are not many at the moment. Should we stop here? (Interjections)- because this would mean standing over another clause again that was stood over, and I think it is not good. May we have the motion for the House to resume?

MINISTERIAL STATEMENT

1.48
THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND SECOND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER (Mr Henry Kajura): Mr Speaker, I wish to announce that tomorrow is a public holiday. (Laughter) This supercedes any other arrangements that we may have made and I would like to assure the House that we shall be represented at the funeral of the late great African John Garang. Services are being organised in the country for tomorrow. We are trying to harmonise the appropriate venue for them so that we can have a grand one and you will be advised accordingly. We cannot dictate to the Churches but we are trying to work out a suitable venue for that for tomorrow. 

With regard to our sons and daughter, as soon as the matter of the bodies has been sorted out you will be advised appropriately. It is early to say anything about it. I thank you, sir.

THE SPEAKER: Okay. Thank you very much. Honourable members, with this we come to the end of today’s proceedings. The House is adjourned until Monday, 8 August 2005 at 2.00 p.m.

(The House rose at 1.52 p.m. and adjourned until Monday, 8 August 2005 at 2.00 p.m.)
