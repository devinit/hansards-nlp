Parliament met at 2.14 p.m. in Parliament House, Kampala

PRAYERS

(The Deputy Speaker, Mr Jacob Oulanyah, in the Chair.)

The House was called to order.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you to this sitting. Today we have just one item on the agenda. We hope we will have sufficient time to handle it.

Honourable members, you will recall that last year we passed a resolution about the She Cranes and the House agreed to support the She Cranes. Some contributions were agreed upon, and when we resumed plenary I made an announcement that the Clerk to Parliament would be effecting the terms of that resolution that was made in this House.

I have seen in my email today, some responses from Members which were not conforming to what was agreed upon in this House. This is to inform you again that that was what we agreed in this House, and resolutions made by us in this House may be advisory to Government but on us they are binding because we make them for ourselves. So, please, cease those emails because that decision was taken by us and it is being effected. 

There shall be no debate on this matter, please. Let us leave it at that. This is a matter that does not require a comment, honourable member. I am just saying a resolution was passed by the House, I reminded Members about this resolution and the Clerk has acted on it. However, I have just seen some emails which were not favourable and that is why I am making this communication. So, please, let us leave it at that. 

MR SEMUJJU NGANDA: Mr Speaker, I was not in Parliament when that resolution was passed by this House, although I fully understand the plight of the She Cranes; in fact, I would have made a bigger contribution. 

The procedural issue I am raising, however, and I have had interactions with colleagues on this, is whether the law allows Parliament or anybody to effect that kind of action on someone’s personal earnings. I am not a lawyer, but as a matter of law does this Parliament have the powers to sit here, when I am away, and resolve that we will contribute maybe Shs 100,000 or Shs 1,000,000 towards the wedding of my father, the hon. Chrispus Kiyonga? Does Parliament have those powers?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: If it came by a resolution of Parliament. If Parliament resolved here and you are a Member of Parliament, you would have to give very good reasons and maybe explain why you do not want to be part of a resolution so that you are put on record. So, you might have to be on record as to why you should be excluded from that resolution.

MR EDDIE KWIZERA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. We all know that the Constitution provides that a person cannot be disenfranchised on pay without their consent and approval. I checked my payslip and got to realise that the Clerk to Parliament had reduced my pay. I communicated to the Clerk to Parliament that she had to refund my money, which was deducted without my authorisation.

A resolution of Parliament cannot, in any way, affect my personal pay. It is irregular. If Parliament wanted to donate money to the She Cranes, there is Shs 200 million approved by this Parliament for netball. There is Shs 500 million approved for sports activities. That is a total of over Shs 700 million. So, I think that was irregular. Actually, the Clerk to Parliament should apologise to us. Otherwise, we are going to take her to court.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay, this is how we are going to handle this matter: I am going to give permission to the honourable Member for Bufumbira and the Member for Kyadondo East to bring a motion that will retract the other motion. That will be the best way to handle this matter. We already have a resolution of this House, made by members of this House in relation to a contribution to the She Cranes, and it was approved by this House. So, we need to retract that resolution; so I need somebody to do that.

Short of a motion, this is not a good debate anymore. I need a motion so that we cancel the other one or amend it in terms that it will not apply to some members. I think that will be the best way to proceed. So, permission is hereby granted to the members concerned to bring a motion to retract the other motion. That is the ruling. There is no further guidance on this matter now.

MR SEMUJJU: Mr Speaker, I am not party to that resolution –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: You are not party to it?

MR SEMUJJU: No, I am not. I only raised a procedural issue asking whether someone can legally deduct my emoluments without my permission. However, if there is another resolution to make another contribution for the She Cranes, I will contribute.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay, honourable members, it looks like the interpretation is that if you do not attend a sitting where a resolution was passed, it does not bind you, which is very strange. 

The best way to resolve this is for us to table another motion to retract the other one. This will allow members to now contribute voluntarily. In the meantime, however, for as long as that resolution is still in force, those things will continue. Can we proceed with normal business now?

2.21
MS ANN AURU (NRM, Woman Representative, Moyo): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise on a matter of national importance. 

Mr Speaker and honourable colleagues, as you might have read in the newspapers and watched on television, since the 5 September this year, Moyo has been in a crisis. On 5 September 2014, the LC V Chairperson of Moyo District plus 15 other people who had gone for census enumeration in a place called Wano - a contested area between South Sudan and Uganda - were arrested in a very brutal and dehumanising way.

I want to thank the Minister of Defence because immediately I reported to him, he acted promptly and our people were released. However, after this, the district council sought a resolution requesting for a peaceful demonstration to show the grievance of the people towards Government for not taking action in showing us our boundaries and also failing to protect the people of Moyo District. 

Indeed, it was a peaceful demonstration but later on some people set ablaze seven houses and a church. This situation provoked the SPLA operatives in that disputed area called Wano, where we have Ugandans. Many houses were burnt and it was reported that women were raped and also livestock was confiscated. 

Following that, about 15 houses of the Kuku community were torched. The Kuku are a community from South Sudan who have settled in Moyo town. The problem is now escalating. Yesterday there was a boy who was cut with a panga by a Kuku man. That boy passed on this morning. When people in the neighbouring sub county heard about this, they also went on rampage and burnt two houses.

Mr Speaker, I would like to know from Government what action they have taken. I would like to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Ministry of Internal Affairs to make a statement on this issue. We might take it lightly but people are dying. This morning, the Kuku community in Moyo District have started packing and returning to their country. How about our people who are in Kajo Keji? What has Government done to ensure that if our people are coming back, they come back like the Kukus are going without being attacked? 

This is an unusual situation, which is very critical, –(Interjection)– and I think Government has not put in enough effort. I would like to hear from the –  

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let the member finish and then if you want to raise a matter, you will raise it. She has the information.

MS AURU: Mr Speaker, I am seeking for protection for my people of Moyo district. I am seeking for protection for Ugandans who are in South Sudan because the way the South Sudanese behave is not the way Ugandans behave; they are so brutal. You can imagine an LCV chairperson being arrested, his shirt being removed and 16 people tied in a row, paraded and marched for over 12 kilometres from the point of arrest! I think we should not tolerate that. 

I do not know what we are doing in South Sudan protecting the Government of Salva Kiir when my people of Moyo District are not protected. We would like to know whether we are Ugandans or South Sudanese. Thank you, Mr Speaker.

MR OLANYA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to thank my honourable colleague for bringing this up. My district also borders South Sudan and now at the border, the people from South Sudan are already telling the local people on the Ugandan side that war has already broken out between South Sudan and Uganda. They are saying that it started in Moyo and it is coming to Amuru and all the other towns bordering South Sudan. 

I really feel that the Government of Uganda needs to take this issue very seriously. It seems like our brothers from South Sudan do not understand coexistence at the boarder points, so they need to be sensitised properly. So, we call upon the Government to take this very seriously.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: There is a request for a proper statement on this subject.

2.28
THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker and honourable members. The events at the common border with our sister neighbour, the Republic of South Sudan, and especially along the border of Moyo, are obviously a matter of regret. It is unfortunate that these events have occurred not once, not twice but many times now. 

Government is very concerned about the threat to the liberty of Ugandans that live along the common border. We are very concerned about the arrest of leaders along the border and the mistreatment of those who were performing their public duty to enumerate Ugandans during the recent census exercise. We therefore have tried as much as we can to engage the authorities in the Republic of South Sudan. The local authorities have had meetings. The security leaders of Moyo and of the other side have met and they have decided on certain measures that will be put in place immediately. 

The Rt Hon. Gen. Moses Ali, who is the Second Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Leader of Government Business in Parliament, has also contacted some leaders in the Republic of South Sudan. He is scheduled to have a meeting this Saturday with some of them to discuss this issue. The President is sending a special envoy to meet with the President of the Republic of South Sudan to raise these issues with them.

We do believe that the situation along the border is one that can be managed, and we are taking all steps necessary – diplomatic - to contain this situation. We have every reason and every hope that these methods we are using will take care of that situation at the border. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Rt Hon. Prime Minister, there was a related issue that the honourable member for Serere had wanted to raise. Maybe this would be the time to raise it so that we can handle them all together.

2.32
MS ALICE ALASO (FDC, Woman Representative, Serere): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Listening to the news yesterday evening and this morning, I heard comments in the media attributed to the foreign affairs ministry of South Sudan. They said that they were giving an ultimatum to all non-Sudanese who work there to leave the country by the 15th of October. 

Mr Speaker, this is something that started, in my view, with the businessmen losing their property. They would be beaten and we would demand a statement and intervention and we would get a lukewarm response. Shortly after that, you remember the issue of expelling the boda bodas came up and the House discussed that matter. Now the Government of South Sudan has issued an ultimatum that all foreigners must leave their country by the 15th of October. 

Mr Speaker, this is a country that has applied to join the East African Community. This is a country for which the sons and daughters of Uganda are dying to protect, even our money and taxes are protecting them. We are looking after them in refugee camps, schools and suburbs and this is the way that they reward our country.

Mr Speaker, I would like to ask the Government of Uganda this time round not to give that lukewarm response. The Government of South Sudan should be told that they have become a hostile neighbour, a very ungrateful relative. We cannot continue when our people are dying, being cheated and expelled. 

There is a person I know in this town who is going to open a fruit factory in South Sudan next week. His workers are now being told that they cannot go there. What happens to his money? If you have been dealing with South Sudan with kid’s gloves, as Ugandans we want to demand of our Government a very stern response. I do not want to be mistaken to be mobilising the communities to become hostile but this is really taking us for granted.

We need to see Government protect Ugandans and our interests, and even justify whether our men and women of the UPDF should still be there because it is this House that gave approval. Maybe we should ask that the UPDF come back home if South Sudan does not understand how to live as good neighbours. I thank you.

MR SSEWUNGU: I thank you, Mr Speaker –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: It is hon. Wamanga-Wamai. It is the Prime Minister who is allowing the information because he is holding the Floor.

MR WAMANGA-WAMAI: Thank you very much. I would like to thank the Prime Minister for allowing clarification. This is quite shocking because South Sudan is a young country. The first thing that came to my mind was, “Is South Sudan a member of the international community? Is South Sudan a member of the global village? Is South Sudan a member of the United Nations? Is South Sudan a member of the AU?” The ultimatum given to foreigners to leave the country is shocking. So, we want a full statement from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to clarify on this issue. 

I do not want to add more to what hon. Alice Alaso has just said. This country has shade blood for the South Sudanese. They have studied here. We have sacrificed for these people but they are not grateful to the people of Uganda. So, we want Government to come up with a statement. 

As we speak now, our equipment, our sons and daughters are in South Sudan. Is this not a slap in our faces? Does this not teach us a lesson? So we should learn and move forward very fast. We think that we are protecting our people but our people left. Do you see what they have done to Ugandans? These people are not grateful. The Government must come up and protect its people. I have just seen pictures where South Sudanese are burning Ugandans! 

We should be serious and the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Internal Affairs – I am glad that the Second Deputy Prime Minister is here and he is at the border; so we expect a response from the Government so that we do not keep losing our people as we are looking on. I thank you.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr Prime Minister, if it is true that there is this ultimatum, and it is also true that the UPDF who are there are non-South Sudanese, does this ultimatum also include the soldiers who must also leave by the 15th? (Applause)

MR SSEWUNGU: Mr Speaker, I want to thank you very much for this opportunity. I want to find out why we love the Sudanese more than they love us, Ugandans? If they are sending us out of their country and we are giving them harmony here, it is unfair. 

I want to state here that the South Sudanese here have more security than the Ugandans, with some of them being guarded by soldiers. How do they get these soldiers to guard them? When we are driving along our roads in Kampala, Sudanese vehicles have a right of way and everybody fears them and yet they are mistreating us. Most of the problems we are facing in some of our schools, it is said are caused by these South Sudanese. So, why do we have to beseech others who are not after us?

Honourable minister and the former Minister for Regional Co-operation, kindly help us because we need to know why soldiers and policemen give adequate security to the South Sudanese not to Ugandans. They are even enjoying our country as if – Whenever we have issues with South Sudan, the Government does not react fast; it takes very long. The Daily Monitor run the story yesterday and we have not heard anything up to now and we have a government. Do you have harmony in your Cabinet? They are marrying our daughters and causing us a lot of problems. So, we really want to find out about that. I thank you. 

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: Let me answer these questions and then I will give way for further clarification. 

Mr Speaker, I did say that the President is sending a special envoy to his colleague and counterpart, President Salva Kiir. There are two specific issues that this special envoy will raise with President Salva Kiir. One is the situation at the border that I have talked about and which hon. Auru also talked about and then also this report. So far, it is only a report in the media that the Government of South Sudan has decided to expel foreigners within its boundaries. So, we would like clarification and a clear statement on what exactly the position is. If it is true that foreigners are being expelled, what exactly do they mean, because obviously the question raised by the Speaker is a very pertinent one?

As far as we are concerned, of course we have a vested interest in the presence of foreigners in the Republic of South Sudan because Ugandans are present, as we know, at the invitation of the government there. They are present as legitimate traders and they are employed in various capacities in NGOs and involved in other activities. 

We know that the Ugandans who are there are there in accordance with the law of the host country. However, we shall seek clarification on this. If the Republic of South Sudan decides that they do not want foreigners within their borders, it is their sovereign right to say so; we cannot impose on them. I really do not want to dwell on this because it is still speculative. Our special envoy who is leaving today will soon make this clear. 

The second point about our border and what has been happening in Moyo is our responsibility. It is the responsibility of this country and this government to protect our people. Therefore, as I said, we will use all channels possible - diplomatic and non-diplomatic - to find a solution to this problem at the border. 

I would like to caution here that as we all know, Sudan is a young country, it is experiencing many problems and as good neighbours, we try to lend a hand in trying to solve some of these problems. Therefore, we handle them with maximum understanding but with firm commitment that we shall discharge our responsibility as a government to protect our people.  Thank you.

MR MATHIAS NSUBUGA: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I thank the Rt Hon. Prime Minister. The Leader of Government Business has said that he read this in the media. We know that we have an embassy of South Sudan in this country and we also have a Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Member of Parliament from Moyo has just said that even our women were raped by the South Sudanese. So, for the Leader of Government Business to come to Parliament when we have not even enquired from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or from the embassy of South Sudan, which is here, whether it is true that foreigners were given an ultimatum to leave South Sudan, I think reflects on how Government is  unserious about its citizens.

We are political leaders in our areas and we have our masses; does the Government want us to tell our people to also chase away the South Sudanese in this country? In some churches, services are held in the South Sudanese languages. You have just said that our army is there to protect the South Sudanese. How can we, as representatives of people, deal with this? 

I know people from my area who were boda boda riders in South Sudan and they were chased away and they lost their property in South Sudan. For how long are we going to continue? Can you be serious, Leader of Government Business, and tell the nation why Ugandans are continuing to be mistreated in a country that has- We have welcomed people from South Sudan. They are here and live in every part of this country. Why are we not retaliating?

MR ALEPER: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Honourable members, I think we have two issues that are before us. The first one, which I think is very urgent, is the border issue where our people were stopped from carrying on their work. Following the words of the Prime Minister that there are certain statements that have come from the media and they are not yet formal but need investigation- (Interruption)

MR KATOTO: Thank you, Mr Speaker. People are being burnt and chased out of their homes. Our citizens are dying in South Sudan and people are raising their concerns and you stand and raise a procedural point that this issue is not important! Is the honourable member in order, Mr Speaker?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, these issues can get very highly emotional, so please be careful about what you say. The Rt Hon. Prime Minister was holding the Floor.

MR SSEMUJJU NGANDA: I want to thank the Rt Hon. Prime Minister for giving way and I thank you, Mr Speaker.

I have been to South Sudan I think three times now and I can understand the emotions and sentiments. I have also been witness to a stampede of Ugandans going to South Sudan, sometimes not even knowing where they are going. I saw Ugandan women sleeping on verandas in South Sudan. That is why I want this Parliament to be very cautious when condemning South Sudan.

South Sudan is a country that is one year old and you are 50 years old.  They have security related problems. Maybe some of our colleagues have never been to South Sudan. I have been to other countries - go to Dubai, Ugandans are being chased; maybe the only difference is that they are not giving an ultimatum. 

I think this Parliament owes it to Ugandans to broadly discuss the issues that are affecting Ugandans, the issues that are making Ugandans run away from their country en masse instead of condemning countries that are also protecting their own jobs. I can understand the sentiments. If they are being beaten, then that is bad and we should deal with it as such. There is even a market in South Sudan constructed I think by Government recently for Ugandans.

As we condemn the violence at the border, I also understand the stampede of Ugandans running away in their thousands to go to South Sudan looking for jobs that we cannot provide. That is what the institution of Parliament must be debating. That is what would provide a solution, not coming here-

Finally, Rt Hon. Prime Minister, I think when you help people you should not burden them. We had a similar problem with Rwanda, where Ugandans treated Rwanda as if it was a district of Uganda. South Sudan is a sovereign state. Deal with problems that have caused unemployment here and you will not have Ugandans going to sleep on the verandas in South Sudan.

MR BAHATI: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Colleagues, two fundamental issues have been raised here; one was raised by hon. Anna Auru, and we want to extend our sympathies to the people of Moyo for the situation that they are going through. The second one, which is also very fundamental, was raised by hon. Alice Alaso. She said that the Government of South Sudan is alleged to have given an ultimatum to foreigners to leave the country by a certain date. 

These are very important issues, Mr Speaker. However, I am a little bit uncomfortable with the way we are proceeding. We either allow the House some little time to debate this issue or Government comes with a statement and we debate it. Now we are at the mercy of the Prime Minister to give way for points of clarification, information or procedure. I think this is not the right way, given the House constitution regarding this issue. Mr Speaker, I seek your procedural guidance.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, both matters came as matters of urgent public importance and as usual, we asked the government to respond. In the course of that response, the Prime Minister has been able to entertain some issues of clarification on the points he is raising. The procedure is entirely correct.

DR EPETAIT: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I heard the Prime Minister say that the Second Deputy Prime Minister is scheduled to meet the authorities in South Sudan. I want to first observe that this is not just a matter of the Rt Hon Moses Ali being a neighbour of South Sudan. We would prefer that a high powered Government delegation gets on board; it is not just about a neighbour going to discuss one on one with them. 

Secondly, this being an urgent and important matter, we demand that a very strict timeline be given within which a report can be furnished to this House, so that we can debate this issue exhaustively for further action. Otherwise, we cannot just watch our people dying. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: So you have already ruled on the subject. (Laughter) You are raising a procedural point and you are already ruling on it. 

DR EPETAIT: Mr Speaker, I propose that you give very tight timelines to the Government within which to come to this House with a report of their latest findings from South Sudan. 

MR ATIKU: Thank you, Rt Hon. Prime Minister, for giving me this opportunity to give you important information. I have video recording that was taken by a businessman from Arua on one of the roads in South Sudan sometime in May. It is a very disturbing video. I know that since you are an IT man, at the appropriate time I will give this video to you and the parliamentary video team. 

Three Ugandans were burnt alive while the South Sudanese were cheering. If you watch this video, you will shade tears. I wanted to give you this information to show you the level of barbarism of the South Sudanese. This was not even done by military people; it was done by the common people of South Sudan. 

Why should this kind of barbarism be tolerated when meted upon our people who are doing business in South Sudan? According to the information I got, these people were buried in Soroti. They were businessmen and a businesswoman; they were all from Soroti. 

Many Ugandans are undergoing torture and are being killed. Property has been lost; actually, those business people were burnt and the merchandise they were taking from Mbale to Juba was looted. Nothing was recovered apart from their dead bodies which were burnt and brought back for burial. 

Rt Hon. Prime Minister, this is very important information. If you need it to enrich this discussion with our colleagues in South Sudan, it will be very useful. 

MR OKOT OGONG: Thank you very much, Rt Hon. Prime Minister. The issue about South Sudan is not new and there is nothing speculative about it. Rt Hon. Prime Minister, you are aware that many Ugandans have died in South Sudan. Clear reports have been presented to Government about Ugandans being victimized in South Sudan. 

Rt Hon. Prime Minister, you are also aware that seven years ago, Ugandans were invited to supply goods to the Government of South Sudan. Many businessmen supplied goods worth US$ 50 million, and this has all been verified but the Government of South Sudan has deliberately refused to pay Ugandans. I am told the President was briefed about this but nothing has been done for these people. Most of their properties have been sold, some of them have died due to stress and yet your Government, Rt Hon. Prime Minister, cannot support your own citizens who have been duped by a government that you are supporting. 

Right now, we are spending a lot of money to secure the citizens of South Sudan yet our own people cannot be supported. Shs 240 billion has been spent there and yet for our people who supplied goods genuinely, which have been verified, our government cannot help. Are we for Uganda or for South Sudan? 

Rt Hon. Prime Minister, can you tell us here that your citizens are suffering and yet you are supporting them there and you cannot support our own here. Double standards should not be tolerated. 

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: I thank the honourable members for making the statements they have made. I would like to say, in terms of what I said in the beginning about what is happening at the border, that yesterday a joint security meeting was held. This meeting was between security commanders of the Uganda Police Force and UPDF from Uganda and the SPLM and SPLA commanders and local leaders from South Sudan. They resolved the following: 

1. 	That all parties must refrain from all kinds of violence and await the outcome of the joint verification committee. 

2. 	That all leaders should go on radio and any other media to denounce and condemn all acts of violence in the area. 

3. 	They condemned the arrest and beating of the LCV Chairman of Moyo District and the census enumerators. 
4. 	The chasing away of foreigners from Moyo and other places, they resolved, would be halted immediately. 

5. 	All deployments that were carried out after the visit of the two presidents in the area – You remember the presidents went there the other time when there was a border dispute. There were deployments after the presidents had resolved that this was a technical issue that would be mapped out by technical people, in other words surveyors, with the help of the international community –

MS BAKO: Mr Speaker, in 2007 I had the opportunity to be with the President for a special East African summit in Arusha that was exclusively dealing with the issues of our international boundaries. That was at the time when we had a crisis with Migingo Island. I remember after midnight, finally an accord was struck and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, hon. Sam Kutesa, pledged that they would go back to the archives in London and get our boundaries marked. He even pledged, during that summit, that he would register this accord with the United Nations. 

Seven years down the road, nothing has happened. Our boundaries are not clearly marked, people keep on encroaching on our territory and the Prime Minister, who I respect so much, is failing in that and is still talking about technicalities. Is he, therefore, in order to continue misleading this country, to continue giving no guidance to this country as our citizens keep suffering in the arms of people that we have protected so much?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Rt Hon. Prime Minister, it sounds like information was being given to you about what has transpired so far, which you should take into account when giving your responses.

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: Resolution No. 6 is that joint security patrols should be instituted to seal off the ungazetted entry points along the border –(Interjections)– I am talking about Moyo. She came in late; should I be the one to raise a point of order?

There are going to be weekly joint security meetings to continually review the security situation. It was also resolved that no armed soldiers be allowed in the contested areas except for joint patrols, and that the school going children, the sick and pregnant women from South Sudan should be allowed to access services across the border. As of today, 17th September, a border security meeting took place at that border; it was attended by local political and security leaders. The situation now as we talk has returned to normal. Our security forces – the Uganda Police Forces, UPDF and intelligence - continue to very closely monitor that situation. 

I thought I should update you, honourable members. I would like to pledge, Mr Speaker, that Government will be updating this Parliament and the country at large at regular intervals on the developments at that the border.

MR ANYWARACH: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I come from a sub county that has issues that are no different from those taking place in Lefoli Sub County in Moyo District. The sub county is called Erussi Sub County in Nebbi. The difference is that Erussi is next to the DRC border while Lefoli is next to South Sudan, but the troubles we go through are almost the same.

In 1997, the DRC soldiers would cross to the Ugandan side. They would dig up what is called andaaki - a big deep and large ditch - across the road that connects Erussi trading centre, where I come from, and Paidha Town Council. They claimed that that road went through their territory. 

In that same year, the soldiers took courage and confronted the DRC soldiers, and the Ugandans killed two of the DRC soldiers. From that time, they learnt a lesson and they have never returned to attack us –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is the procedural matter? If you want to give information, please just do that. Otherwise, you cannot rise on a procedural point and start telling stories. That is not proper.

MR ANYWARACH: Okay, Mr Speaker, the procedural point is: would it not be proper for us as a House to pass a resolution of Parliament urging Government to determine the borders of Uganda? The issue in Lefoli is not really about enumerators being attacked. The enumerators were attempting to go to a territory that the South Sudanese claim to be theirs. That is issue. 

The same thing is happening in Nebbi where the DRC authorities have moved one kilometre into Uganda and constructed a big customs point being manned by them. We raised this issue with the RDC and with government. We told them that we need to ascertain the borders because these people entered our territory. All that we received was that we should stay amicably with our neighbours.

Therefore, Mr Speaker, wouldn’t it be in order for us to pass a resolution? Any casual presentations like the one the Prime Minister is talking about, that the army generals met yesterday and resolved, and linking that to what the hon. Christine Bako was saying that from 2007 they have been committing to determine the borders of Uganda right from the time when the Migingo issue occurred –

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, you know the procedure of raising motions for resolutions of Parliament. You know the procedure on how to raise a motion that can lead to a resolution of Parliament. Do I need to rule on that?

MR KWIZERA: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to ask the Prime Minister to clarify on some of the statements he made. Two sovereign countries have a problem and they are using the military as if they do not have relevant ministries! The President is the first country diplomat, so when he says that the President is sending an envoy, it means the second country diplomat, who is the Minister of Foreign Affairs, has failed to summon the ambassador to answer for what is happening.

I want to request the Prime Minister to tell us when the Minister of Foreign Affairs summoned the Ambassador of South Sudan and why we should use the military before we can use our diplomatic means. Thank you.

MS KARUNGI: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Like other members have said, Kanungu District has also been having border problems. The Congolese have been crossing the border and attacking people in Kanungu in one of the sub counties near the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. The Government has been promising that something would be done; so I want to know whether there is anything being done, so that our people can also settle. Thank you very much.

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: The situation I have been describing and the response of the authorities on the spot, which in this case was from the security and political leaders of the area, was the most pragmatic and the shortest way this problem could be handled. 

We are handling this of course through diplomatic channels, as I said. I think some members came in after I had made this statement, so I am repeating myself because I had already stated these are things at the beginning of my statement. On the issue of DRC attacking the people of Kanungu, Mr Speaker, I undertake to get better particulars from my MP and then I will respond.

Finally, on the question of Ugandans that supplied goods to South Sudan, it is only last week that I made a statement to this House on this matter. In summary, I said that yes, Government is fully aware of this situation. We have had a very long engagement with the leadership of the Republic of South Sudan on this issue. We have had ministers – The Minister for Trade, hon. Amelia Kyambadde, has been pursuing this matter. The Minister for Justice, hon. Otafiire, has been involved in this matter. Hon. Daudi Migereko and the Minister of Foreign Affairs have been involved in this matter. 

I also visited Juba to discuss this matter and held discussions with the President. President Museveni has also held meetings with his counterpart. The Minister of Finance only last week, I told you, in a meeting in Addis Ababa raised this issue and got an update from her counterpart from South Sudan. 

I am giving you these details to show you that Government is not only seized with this issue but actually we have been following it very closely. I think we are beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel because we had a joint ministerial meeting here at which it was resolved that this matter must be expedited. 

I was informed, and I did inform this House last week, that according to the Minister of Finance of South Sudan, they have now finished verification and they are just beginning the process of payment. They are paying those that have legitimate claims as having supplied goods to South Sudan. 

I would like to urge them, yes it has been unfortunate but we all know - I do not want to go into the details because I do not want to be on the border of diplomacy. We know very well what happened to the kitty in South Sudan - the problems they have had internally purely because, as hon. Ssemujju said, this is a new nation that has considerable problems and needs our help. Thank you. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Rt Hon. Prime Minister, how do we move from here? How do we follow what is going on? 

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: As I said, I undertook to keep this House updated on the situation on a regular basis. The President has sent a special envoy to South Sudan. Gen. Ali is going to meet the security people at the border, the leaders are meeting; we will keep you abreast with what is happening at a regular interval. As soon we have information for you, we will do so. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Can we have a formal statement from Government on Tuesday afternoon? 

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: Yes. (Laughter) Mr Speaker, you asked a question and I answered it directly. The question was: Can Government present a formal statement next Tuesday on this situation and my answer is yes, Government will do that.

MS CECILIA OGWAL (FDC, Woman Representative, Dokolo): Thank you, Rt Hon Speaker. I would like to get an assurance from – [Hon Member: “What happened?”]- You have not been coming to the House; that is why you are asking me what happened. (Laughter)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, you might have to make a short personal statement on that issue so that members are okay.

MS OGWAL: Rt Hon. Speaker, a statement has been made about my arm, and that is why I am calling the minister to order because he has not been coming. However, you and the whole House have eliminated any element of domestic violence. (Laughter) The House has been assured that this was a normal accident that could happen to anybody, particularly women who are so involved in activities in the house. (Laughter) This is one of the consequences of these activities outside Parliament.

Mr Speaker, we are dealing with a very serious matter and I would like an assurance from the Rt Hon. Prime Minister as to what action the Government has taken now to stop any further violence. I want to be assured of that. 

Two, I would like to be assured about what Government has put in place to take care of the humanitarian disaster which has resulted from this violence. Houses have been torched and people have been displaced and killed. I want to know what the Government has put in place to deal with the disaster arising from the current situation. Rt Hon. Speaker, can you draw the attention of the Prime Minister to listen to me; he is listening to his neighbour.

Rt Hon. Prime Minister, I want you to listen. I want to know what the Government has put in place to make sure that the displaced persons in Moyo District have been taken care of. How about the children and the women? We have seen some of the images where women have been gang raped while others are cheering; what action has been taken to address those issues? 

Rt Hon. Prime Minister, do not just come to the House to read a statement of the special envoy, what has been done, the diplomatic initiatives and so on. We want to be assured that as a government you have taken steps to make sure that those who have already suffered disaster, those who have been displaced, those who have no food to eat are being looked after. I thank you, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you very much, member for Dokolo, for that additional matter that the Prime Minister has to take care of when they come to make a statement. 

MR BIREKERAAWO NSUBUGA: Rt Hon. Speaker, the Prime Minister has assured us that he is going to make a statement, but I have had the opportunity to look at the images referred to by hon. Atiku. Can you allow the House, before we debate his statement, to see these images? 

I cannot believe what I have seen! I cannot accept even for one day that a Ugandan can go through such circumstances in South Sudan. Can you, Rt Hon. Speaker, allow the House to look at the images which hon. Atiku has on his recording?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, that video was taken in May of this year as the member himself stated. It may be of significance about what is happening now; we think we can make an arrangement to have that done, but I cannot make a commitment on the record that I will arrange. However, members will have an opportunity to view this if it is available, but it will not be an official action of Parliament that there will be a meeting called for viewing videos. That, I will not do.

BILLS
SECOND READING

THE VALUE ADDED TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2014

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, this is the single item on the Order Paper today. It is a Bill of four clauses but it looks like it is quite heavy. We received the report from the committee on this Bill the last time. I do not remember proposing the question for your debate because we deferred the debate. 

I now propose the question for debate on the principles of this Bill. Honourable members, the motion is that the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2014 be read the second time. We have received the report from the committee and that is the motion that I propose for your debate and debate starts now on the principles of the Bill. Three minutes each.

MR JOHN MULIMBA (NRM, Samia Bugwe County North, Busia): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the chairperson of the committee for the report well done and presented. I want to support the recommendations that were elaborated by the chairperson of the Committee on Finance. 

I want to state my justification on two principles. The first is that VAT is an indirect tax that is ultimately borne, as in this instance, by the final consumer. We also have the VAT Act that stipulates the threshold for those that are eligible for VAT. The imposition of VAT on agricultural inputs like pesticides, hoes, fertilisers and the rest are going to have a negative effect on productivity in the agricultural sector. 

I want to remind the House that agricultural productivity has been going down in Uganda since the 1990s when productivity stood at 5.2 per cent. In 2000, it fell to 2.5 per cent and in the last financial year, agricultural productivity declined to 1.4 per cent. In Vision 2040, the focus is to improve agricultural productivity to about 5.6 per cent. Imposition of VAT on agricultural inputs and yet we intend to modernise agriculture for purposes of increasing productivity will not yield results.

I do not know whether the people in the Ministry of Finance thought through this before proposing VAT on agricultural inputs. As we speak now, we are likely to lose Shs 80 billion in proceeds from cotton exports. As we speak now, we have thousands of litres of pesticides that are in the warehouse in Entebbe being held on account of VAT and yet the cotton season is not going to hold on. The cotton seed borer is devouring the cotton crop as we speak now. 

As we therefore, propose and expect to collect Shs 30.84 billion, you are likely to lose Shs 80 billion only from one item, that is, cotton exports, but there are many others. Research has been carried out by so many agencies including EPRC and results have shown that even from maize alone, we are likely to decrease productivity and earnings from one acre of maize from Shs 328,000 down to Shs 274,000. I would therefore – (Member timed out.)

MR SSEMUJJU NGANDA (FDC, Kyadondo County East, Wakiso): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have a problem with the collection of VAT and I have raised this problem with URA. Uganda Revenue Authority will usually collect that tax on sales; you will sell something and raise an invoice and the following day, URA will want you to go and pay that tax. Sometimes, by the way, you may never be paid but for them, they have already collected that tax.

I want Government to help us understand the collection of this tax, especially the medium enterprises that you claim to be supporting through various initiatives. You start a business and give employment to Ugandans but before that business stabilises, as long as you raise around three invoices, URA will be at your door and sometimes even with padlocks. Sometimes it is better when you are doing business with Government because they will withhold that percentage of the tax, but with private suppliers and individuals, in the end you cripple –

MR ANYWARACH: Thank you for giving way, honourable member. The quick information that I want to give is that in the collection of VAT, I see that there is a lot of imbalance. When Government is sending money from the central Government to the local government, they remove the 18 per cent VAT immediately from source. 

However, as the honourable member is saying, once you raise an invoice, Government immediately removes money from your account instead of removing the money from the account of the person going to pay you. That is how the media houses are suffering. When I work with you, I am going to pay you and you are supposed to actually remove the money from the source. The source is actually the person paying and not the one receiving. But the soonest I raise the invoice, you are already coming to collect the 18 per cent; I think that is very dangerous. That is the information that I want to give you.  

MR SSEMUJJU: I want to thank you very much, my colleague, for that information. So, if Government wants to help small and medium sized enterprises, my prayer is that you should stop making them pay a tax on money that they have not –(Member timed out.)

MR FELIX OKOT OGONG (NRM, Dokolo County, Dokolo): Mr Speaker, I think that this is an axis of evil. (Laughter) The proposal that is in this Bill is the last nail on our farmers’ coffin. It is going to kill agriculture in Uganda.  

Mr Speaker, the Maputo Protocol resolved that every Government should spend close to 10 per cent of their budget on agriculture, but Uganda is spending less than three per cent; so we are still below the line. 

In most developed countries, the agricultural sector is being subsidized by their governments. But here is our Government proposing that our people should now pay 18 per cent and yet it is the farmers, the poor people, who are supporting and supplying produce to our people.

Honourable members, it is clear that when any produce is being sold, 18 per cent must come to Government. In that case, it is not the supplier but the farmer who is going to foot the bills. They are going to reduce 18 per cent from the prices. If something is Shs 600, then they will remove 18 per cent from the Shs 600 and that means that it is going to come to Shs 400, and that money will go to the revenue authority but at the expense of our farmers. 

I want to thank this committee, and I think that as a Parliament we are doing our job very well. Your recommendation is spot on; we should not impose VAT on agricultural produce. (Applause) Thank you very much.

Mr Speaker, I want to appeal to Government that if you want to milk a cow, you must feed that cow. So if you want productivity in agriculture, if you want food, then you must feed that sector. We should not distress that sector.

I have seen in this Bill that we are going to impose 18 per cent tax on fertilizers. Our farmers are not using fertilizers because they are expensive and you know that very well. These are the same people who are elected by voters everywhere and they are the same people proposing 18 per cent tax on fertilizers. Is this realistic? You want them to be more expensive so that our farmers cannot use them!  

They are talking about pesticides. They are already expensive and most of our farmers are not using them. If we need agriculture to prosper, then the ministry should actually withdraw this suggestion; we should not even debate it –(Member timed out.)

3.35
MR PATRICK AMURIAT (FDC, Kumi County, Kumi): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity. I rise to support the recommendations made by the committee and to reiterate the fact that what the government is proposing in imposing taxes on agricultural inputs is going to kill agriculture in this country.

Mr Speaker, it needs to be said that more than 80 per cent of the population of Uganda is employed in the agricultural sector. It also needs to be observed that agriculture contributes about 54 per cent of the national export revenue earnings and yet agriculture continues to receive a dismal amount of the budget of Uganda. Doing what the government wants to do in imposing VAT on agricultural inputs is effectively going to put about 80 per cent of the population out of employment.

I am a practising farmer and I grow all sorts of crops including cotton. Cotton requires labour intensity. You need to weed the cotton fields three or four times in order for you to get yields. You need to fertilise land that is now getting tired by the day. You need pesticides to keep the pests out of the crop. In fact, pests are becoming more complicated today; if you do not spray your cotton garden or even your groundnut garden, you will not receive the expected yield.

Mr Speaker, I think Government should have some bit of shame. The other year you read a budget that you claimed was pro-people, a pro-poor budget. This year, you come with a budget that seems to be going against that principle that you upheld just one year ago. What are you doing to the population? Killing it!

I think the Ministry of Finance needs to look elsewhere to get money to finance their budget, otherwise I do not know whether you will survive the year 2016 because of what you are doing now. The NRM, you may not survive. You are not going to survive –(Member timed out.)

MR PETER OKEYOH (NRM, Bukooli Island County, Namayingo): Thank you, Rt Hon. Speaker, for this opportunity. I want to begin on a very sad note by saying that this is very unfortunate and it is going to make my party unpopular. I want to say that it is very unfair to our farmers and to my fishing community when you levy a tax on fish. Actually, this government has not done anything to help the fishing community. The fishermen buy all the equipment including nets and they are exploited by the purchasers.

Rt Hon. Speaker, another issue I want to comment on, as an educationist, is the tax on education materials. We are labouring to promote education, so this would be very unfortunate on our side. 

I do not want to see my government giving farmers with the left hand and withdrawing with the right. We are promoting agriculture and encouraging graduates to go into agriculture and then you levy taxes on seeds and fertilizers. It is very unfortunate. Many who would have borrowed money from the banks are going to be arrested and imprisoned. 

It is, therefore, my humble appeal that these taxes be waived. I know members are going to say that we need taxes to raise salaries for government workers and even for Parliament, but this is very unfortunate. I would pray that this tax be waived or stayed. Thank you, Rt Hon. Speaker.

3.40
MR KENNETH LUBOGO (Independent, Bulamogi County, Kaliro): Thank you very much, Rt Hon. Speaker. I also want to thank the committee for the report that was submitted.

I think the Ministry of Finance needs to be careful and stop negligent alterations on tax regimes. I call this negligent because to impose taxes on hand hoes, seeds, cereals and so on qualifies to be called a negligent way of trying to raise money for this government.

We have a problem here that once a budget is read, from the 1st July of the financial year, the new rates are applied. Now we are trying to see that we revert the situation, which I believe a serious Parliament will actually have to do, but even when we have reverted the situation, it becomes too hard for the businessmen to change the prices. They have already changed the prices for feeds, salt and hoes and now here we are labouring to make sure that we change that but the problem is that the poor are not actually saved because of your action. 

Surely, this is something, which I believe we should be very careful about. You remember how we raised excise duty on sugar? It had no impact on the prices, so we only gave money to the rich.

Mr Speaker, you know that Uganda’s population is growing very fast, at about 3.2 per cent, but agriculture is growing at a lesser rate than the population growth of the country. The impact of this in the long run is that Uganda will not produce enough for us to export and hardly enough for us to feed our population. So, if we are here to support the sector that we hope is the backbone for our country, we do not need to go into taxing these agricultural primary inputs.

Mr Speaker, this particular Bill we are considering was targeting the very poor because who uses a hand hoe? Who is involved in that primary farming? Is it is not the very poor man? So I want to support the recommendations that have been made by the committee. I want to invite my colleagues to drop the recommendations and proposals that were made by the minister to impose these taxes, which are especially impacting on poor communities. I thank you, Mr Speaker.

3.44
MS ROSEMARY NYAKIKONGORO (Independent, Woman Representative, Sheema): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the committee for that recommendation because when you look at that tax imposed on agricultural inputs, our people, especially the peasants, are likely to suffer. 

Mr Speaker, last month, I remember I presented an issue here with regard to the coffee – and why many people were crying foul was because those inputs are already expensive. Given the fact that the taxes on those inputs were likely to see a lot of counterfeit in the country because much of the products we are bring in are from Kenya and they are already fake. And since they are expensive, the counterfeits are going to increase and that will affect this country. 

Mr Speaker, agriculture is good for food security; agriculture is good for food nutrition and agriculture employs people. I want you to look at what is happening in South Sudan, most of these people they are talking about are dealing in agriculture. And that means that when these inputs affect agriculture productivity, it means that even those people who have been engaged in business in South Sudan will not have the opportunity to trade there because they will have no products to sell. 

Mr Speaker, right now, agriculture mechanisation is expensive. Opening up a plot of land in my place using a tractor cost around Shs 500,000. Imagine we are encouraging farmers to increase productivity. And now as we speak, due to the speculation in increased taxes, opening up a plot of land is now Shs 700,000. How is a peasant going to increase agricultural productivity amidst all those challenges of increased prices? 

Mr Speaker, value chain support is likely to affect agricultural productivity. For instance, spare part machinery, equipment which are already expensive; people are going to withdraw from participating in agricultural activities because already the prices are high. 

I propose that URA and Ministry of Finance should look around; there are many targets where they can get these taxes rather than taxing agricultural input. 

Honourable members, you may think that increasing taxes on agriculture is very cheap. But when you go to your constituencies, find out how many people are asking for a single hoe. There are many families that share one hoe; how does this help especially since they are asking us to give them hoes and we are putting taxes on hoes. 

3.48
MR JACK SABIITI (FDC, Rukiga County, Kabale): Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Minister of Finance is the President of this country. The president has gone around talking about increasing agriculture, adding value to our products – I do not know the reason why the minister in charge of this sector now has come out to sabotage the President of this country to make sure that agriculture is undermined. 

I request that we walk the talk. If you cannot add more taxes on a hoe, and fertilisers, agricultural machinery – it seems you want the people of Uganda to die for lack of food! I wonder if the minister is really implementing the relevant constitutional provision Minister of Finance has gone around talking about. 

I therefore support the recommendations of the committee; if this is not done, I am sure the people of this country will come up with the idea that this government is not serious. If this government is serious, then we must walk the talk. So I request all of us Members of Parliament to support this committee so that the agricultural sector which is given only 4.6 percent is at least given chance to move ahead and provide food for our citizens. 

3.50
MR TONNY AYOO (NRM, Kwania County, Apac): I want to start by thanking the committee for doing a thorough work and meeting all the people who matter in the process of making this committee report. Also I want to thank the minister for conceding in many areas after bringing these proposals. I think the minister realised there was a mistake somewhere because where the President was addressing the nation, he took about two hours talking about how we can develop agriculture and how agriculture can help Ugandans to get rid of poverty. And yet in the budget, there was this proposal.

Mr Speaker, putting tax on poultry and livestock would greatly distort the progress of this sector because first of all it is already expensive to get rich breeds of poultry and livestock. And when we bring in tax, our business people have got a tendency of pushing the entire tax burden to the final consumer. And I think the committee is right to say that we leave out this tax. 

As we talk now, the prices of some of these products are already expensive on the market even when there was no need for them to increase. When you look at machinery for processing diary and agricultural products, most Ugandans are still using hand hoes and very few are using ox-ploughs. The tractors are simply not there and yet we are talking about commercialising agriculture and use of machinery. So introducing a tax will go a long way in harming the sector. 

When you look at tourist’s lodges and hotels, I think that is not so much for the ordinary people. We would have some more taxes levied on that. Let us look into these issues as Parliament, one by one. Those we need to remove, we remove them and those that need to be levied be levied. 

When you look at processing milk; this is an industry which is just beginning to gain momentum. It would be too fast for us to start levying taxes on the products being processes – (Member timed out_)

3.53
MR LATIF SSEBAGALA (DP, Kawempe Division North, Kampala): Thank you, Mr Speaker and I support the committee report. I am going to confine myself on poultry. When you look at the poultry industry, it is one of the fastest growing industries. We have so many Ugandans, including Members of Parliament, in this industry. I am also a poultry farmer – but we have tried our level best, through various organisations, to engage Government, in as far as putting a policy on stopping or banning the exportation of unprocessed maize is concerned. This is because unprocessed maize – in fact, those are the feeds for the industry but our effort in trying to ask Government to put up a policy of this nature to encourage poultry famers has been to no avail. 

Government has been saying they don’t want to encroach on the rights of exporters yet as poultry farmers, we have suffered as a result of failure to ban the exportation of unprocessed maize because at the end of the day we buy these feeds at very expensive prices. So, if that is the case, how will this situation be when we impose taxes? Won’t that mean that prices for feeds for the poultry industry will go high?

Mr Speaker, I would like to suggest that since we all agree to the fact that Uganda’s economic backbone is agriculture where 80 per cent of Ugandans earn their living from - when we impose taxes on that sector, we will be doing a disservice because as a country, we have failed to provide employment opportunities to the nation. I believe that Government cannot employ all Ugandans. So, it is in sectors such as agriculture that people can get alternative employment. It will be bad for us to kill such an industry. If we are to build a strong agricultural sector, we need to encourage people – (Member timed out_)

MR RAPHAEL MAGYEZI (NRM, Igara County West, Bushenyi): Mr Speaker, thank you for the opportunity. I also join my colleagues to thank the committee for presenting this report. I stand to support the recommendations in here.

Mr Speaker, my contributions will be on taxes on agricultural inputs. Uganda depends on agriculture for the subsistence of the majority of our people. Igara West Constituency, in particular is a rural constituency and the biggest population really depends on agriculture for subsistence, food and incomes. The biggest tool and which is the popular tool is the hand-hoe, which is now sold at about Shs 7,000. But this is found high for the people, it is common that an ordinary farmer will use the hand-hoe to the last metal. 

For anybody to impose even a shilling as tax on these basic tools of a farmer – I think that is very dangerous for the people! It presents policy inconsistency. We keep talking about enhanced production. We keep talking about supporting the peasant farmer to move away from peasantry but we are also saying that even the small subsidy on the basic tool is gone? This should not be accepted, honourable members. Let us stand to say, ‘No taxes on hoes!’ If anything, we should be providing these hoes free of charge to the people. It is s small tool that could help people come out of poverty to increase on their livelihood.

In terms of income, the people of Igara West depend mainly on tea as their main cash crop. But for us to produce tea the basic inputs are fertilisers, herbicides pesticides and the slightest touch on the prices of these commodities will certainly result in the increase in the prices. 

For the last about eight months, we have had a challenge as tea producers in terms of the world prices of tea going down. And other countries notably Kenya and Rwanda have been providing subsidies to their farmers during this crisis. So, it surprises me that while our neighbours are providing subsidies to their tea farmers to cushion them against the falling world prices, in Uganda we just want to increase the prices of the inputs thereby – (Member timed out_)

MS HELLEN ASAMO (NRM, PWD Representative, Eastern): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to support the report of the committee on taxing the peasants. However, I have a challenge. I don’t know whether it is a blanket withdraw of taxes because there are farmers who are commercial in their operations. So, are we talking about all these groups of farmers or not? If we talk about the general thing, we will not be fair. 

Our people are usually manipulated by big commercial farmers like Mukwano. So, once we impose taxes, these farmers will take advantage of this situation –(Interjections)– yes, those are my words and I am entitled to them. I want to say that we would think about a process of coming up with categories. If we are talking about peasant, that should be at a certain level so that we can be able to find those levels that can handle such taxes. We can propose a threshold and get money because we need this money. When you talk about supplying free hoes, we need money to procure those hoes. Government cannot pick hoes from the road. 
Mr Speaker, that is my proposal; I don’t want to support the issue of giving a blanket statement. Thank you.

4.02
MS CHRISTINE BAKO (FDC, Woman Representative, Arua): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I would like to draw your attention to the growth rates of agriculture in this country since 2005. In 2008, it grew to -2.4 percent according to the Bank of Uganda reports and our population rates growth rate then was 3.6 per cent.

Last year, Government encouraged the use of contraceptives and the rates, according to the Ministry of Health went to about four per cent. And it is this same Government that is promoting contraceptive use, levying VAT on agricultural inputs. The people who are proposing this tax must actually be rulers of darkness, Mr Speaker, because the implication of this statement is that if we are unable to feed 10.2 million Ugandans today, it would be abnormal, unthinkable, unreasonable to levy a tax let alone of 18 per cent on agricultural inputs.

Mr Speaker, therefore, why would this Parliament pass a supplementary to combat the Foot and Mouth Disease and turn around to levy a tax of 18 per cent? You now begin to question what the economic development policy of this country is. We keep talking about a private-sector led growth, and how is it supposed to come? This notion that agriculture is the back bone of this country, is it reflected in the taxation policies that you we are trying to introduce? Absolutely not!
 
The question therefore is who are the people that advise the President on matters of tax in this country? This tax alone should not be looked upon from the farmers side alone, looked at what this farmer is doing to educate his or her child. Look at the education disparities in this country, look at the regional inequality in terms of wealth in this country and then go deep to analyse the impact of this tax on the various regions. How are our farmers especially in Arua unable to have two meals a day going to generate school fees for their own children?

By taxing agriculture you are eliminating children from school especially those whose parents are trying to afford education through agriculture and here we are having these excellent economists in the ministry of finance, I would wonder whether these economists in the ministry of finance are Ugandans with some little bit of peasant background like me. If not - (Member timed out_)

4.06
MS BETTY AMONGI (UPC, Oyam South County, Oyam): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to start by addressing the concern from the honourable member for PWDs, Eastern. The VAT is the tax that is charged by the supplier of a good or service and that tax is collected and remitted by that supplier to Government. If, for example, I import iron ore and my selling price is Shs 5,000 then I have to charge the 18 percent on top of what I consider my profit price and that 18 is remitted to Government. It is not a tax that will help you to tax the large companies.

If you want to tax Mukwano and the effect is born by the farmers then you can put income tax on them not VAT. The threshold for VAT is Shs 50 million and the assumption is that if, for example, a big company supplies machinery to a middle income company, that middle income company dealing in agricultural implements is supposed to keep passing it until the final consumer. If this country, majority of the agricultural people who are dealing in implements are not registered under the threshold of Shs 50 million, that can wash away VAT. In other words, if we allow this tax to be charged, the final people who are going to bear the price will be the farmers because the big businessmen will wash it away because it will be given away to Government, and it will not affect them so at the end of it will affect the local farmer. 

That is why I want to agree with the committee report that we should reject these taxes and if I am to supplement on the issue of cereals, already we passed a law here where COMESA countries are allowed to export to this country without any taxes. Now if you allow this tax on cereals for your maize, sorghum, rice it means rice coming from Tanzania, Kenya and these other countries will flood this market of Uganda because they subsidize their farmers in other countries, yet for us we do not subsidise. At the end of it the cereals in this country will be out of market. Agriculture’s input to the GDP will fall. These are very unproductive tax measures to this country –(Member timed out.)

MR MATHIAS MPUUGA (IND, Masaka Municipality, Masaka): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the committee for the good report. At 18 percent, the VAT in Uganda is one of the highest and I don’t think that the proposal to zero rate and remove the tax from some particular supplies and products was in effect meant to collect more Government revenue. But I think they were mere tax measures and I will be last person to encourage any Government worth its name to engage in desperate taxation because when you do this you can never realise the revenue anticipated while moving desperately.

For instance, removing exemptions from salt supplies is not only ridiculous but criminal. Any medical person will tell you that salt is a basic medicine. I hope this is not for witch doctors. For the Government to levy a tax on salt is not only desperate but criminal and I would like to ask this House to question the motive of this Government in attempting to levy a tax on salt! 
One of the challenges bedeviling Government today is the failure to undertake digital migration, billions of shillings have been spent but very likely we shall not beat the deadline. The Government is trying to deepen ICT penetration in our education institutions. What are they doing? They are imposing a tax on computers. Three years ago Government stopped the importation of used computer and that was the source of computers for our schools in the countryside. 

Government allowed importation of new computers at no tax but still –(Member timed out_)

MR ABDI CHEMASWET (NRM, Kween County, Kween): I would like to take a different view a bit and of course the most unpopular of opposing the recommendations, and of course the ministry for conceding in other areas. As a Government and as a country we need to fund our sectors, it is not a matter of saying where are we getting the money from; we need the money to fund other sectors and if we are discussing about agricultural sector we should not discuss it exclusively. We should discuss it with the other sectors such as the road sector. For me in Sebei I need a road, how will we fund these roads?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member, let me interrupt you a bit, I see children leaving. In the public gallery this afternoon we have pupils and teachers of St Teresa Day and Boarding Primary School in Ibanda. They are represented by hon. John Byabagambi and hon. Margaret Kiboijana Woman MP for Ibanda. They have come to observe the proceedings please welcome them. (Applause)

MR CHEMASWET: We need to fund the roads. If you give me a good road from Kapchorwa to Saum, then automatically my cost of living will go down and I will have a lot of money. Even if you tax me, even if you tax that one hoe and you reduce on the cost of transport, it will be very important for me to survive –(Interruption)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order.

MR OKUMU: I am rising on a Point of Order and not Odo. (Laughter)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us have order, members. A Point of Order is being raised.

MR OKUMU: Is the honourable member in order to argue that he needs roads and he needs this road from taxing agriculture, which is not fattened as one of the colleagues earlier said that in order to milk a cow, you need to fatten it – and to disregard the agricultural sector as a sector that is not important in the economy and yet the majority of the people in Uganda and his constituents actually rely on it for survival as peasants. In order to promote that peasantry life to a level where we can be able to tax them better, we need to support them and not tax them! 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Point of Order.

MR OKUMU: We need to transform that informal sector into the formal sector. Is it therefore in order for the honourable member to continue to argue that it is important to tax the informal sector at the expense of the majority of the people of Uganda in order to get money to build roads and yet we have a lot of money that is being ‘eaten’ through corruption in other areas? Is he in order to continue demeaning his own constituents?

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable member for Kween, take notice that the honourable member for Aswa County has strong objections to what you have just said. (Laughter)   

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, we need to conclude this properly. 

MR CHEMASWET: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As a member of the Committee on National Economy, the Government has borrowed a lot of money and we need to pay back. For us to pay back, we need some taxation and we have to be objective on this. Even if you want to be popular in terms of this tax, we need to proceed with this tax. I need a road from Kapchorwa to Suam, I need a road from Muyembe to Nakapiripirit, I need a road to Northern Uganda –(Interjections)– I need a road from Bumbobi to Lwakhakha, we need a road from Rukungiri-Kihihi and Kanungu -  

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Point of Order.

MS ALUM: Thank you, Mr Speaker. As far as debate is going, there is a general consensus that we have to adopt the report of the committee. Research has been done and it is very true that our Government is giving a very small budget to the agricultural sector and compared to other countries like Ghana, Rwanda and even Kenya here, our country is doing very badly as far as agriculture is concerned. And moreover, there is no subsidy given to the agricultural sector. Is it therefore in order for the honourable member holding the Floor to say that we need to start taxing agriculture in order to get the good roads? Is he in order? 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Members, one of the cardinal rules of parliamentary practice and procedure is that the view of the majority will carry but the right of the minority must be respected. (Applause) This is even contained in our own Rules of Procedure and that is why you have minority reports attached. It would hardly be possible for a House that allows for a committee to have minority reports for it to reject minority reports or views. The member for Kween is protected by the Chair to raise his views.

MR WILBERFORCE YAGUMA (NRM, Kashari County, Mbarara): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the committee and I support the position of the committee. I want to ask the Government side and my colleague from NRM – because what we are about to do is to go against the Constitution. The framers of the Constitution in the objective No. XXII on food security and nutrition and allow me to read: “The state shall—
(a) 	take appropriate steps to encourage people to grow and store adequate food;
(b) 	establish national food reserves; and
(c)	 encourage and promote proper nutrition through mass education and other appropriate means in order to build a healthy state.”

Now, Mr Speaker, if I can ask colleagues to take a moment and reflect on what we are calling agriculture in our constituencies. Our poor peasant people using the hoe, just moving a bit from the stone age, to survive. The soils are exhausted there are no properties supplied by the Government as required by the Constitution and now you go ahead and put a tax on a hoe. Many of our people in the villages cannot afford the hoe even at the present price, and yet it is the duty of the state to make sure that we grow and store enough food.

If I may ask, can the government now show me the government warehouses where food is stored in case of an emergency? How many times have we run out of food in various parts of the country and we run to the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness where there are even no supplies? 

So for that matter, I do not support the taxes on the hoe and secondly, I do not support the tax on gas. If I was the Government, I would have imposed tax on charcoal to discourage people from cutting trees to burn charcoal. But now if you impose tax on gas, instead of encouraging the people to use gas and save our forests, what are we doing?

Finally, I want to advise my government that instead of panicking and going for the impossible, let us seal the leakages in the budget. The Shs 24 billion Katosi Road –(Applause)- 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, please hold on. The points being raised are mainly on agriculture. There is the issue of accommodation, new computers, computer software and packaging material – that debate is not being taken and all the members are contributing in respect of agriculture. Can we at this time - because these matters, as I said, have been a topic of discussion for a while. Can I, at this time, because I had already noticed the members for Oyam District, Butambala County, Mbale Municipality and Bunyaruguru – but can we at this time allow the Prime Minister or the person in charge of the sector to state to the House what it is all about because the House seems to have a certain view? Can we have another view on this subject and then we see how to proceed with this?

THE PRIME MINISTER AND LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (Mr Amama Mbabazi): Mr Speaker, I rise to state the obvious that our Government is a peoples’ government and it listens. So I would like to propose that we adopt a give and take position. Therefore, I want to give and I hope you will take and also give in turn. I thank the committee for the report they have made and I want to propose that we give in on the supply of seeds - I thought you would be happy – and fertilizers -

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: It is good manners to encourage positive things to grow.

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: And pesticides and hoes. But let me make a very important point because I thought the honourable member for Kween had a very fundamental point he was presenting, and I want to say that when designing policy options, due consideration is given to the impact such measures may have on revenue, industry and the economy and provide a balance between revenue enhancement and promotion of investment.

That is why although we are giving in on fertilizers, for example, we do it reluctantly because we have attracted an investor. The other day the President launched a project where the investor is going to invest $ 560 million. It is one of the biggest projects in Uganda’s history so it would be discouraging for him to hear that you can invest so much money and yet you cannot recover VAT.

This is because there are things on which inevitably they pay VAT like inputs; the electricity they consume, the water and all these things and they cannot recover it –(Interruption)

MR AMURIAT: Mr Speaker, I thank you very much and I thank His Excellency - Rt Hon. Prime Minister. That was a slip of the tongue. Yes, I could say His Excellency anyway. Is there any harm in saying that?

Mr Speaker, the procedural matter I would like to raise relates to the Bill before us. The Bill exclusively states reasons where Government wants to bring back VAT and also areas where it wants to impose VAT and these are specifically laid out.

The procedural point I want to raise is whether it wouldn’t be correct procedure for the Rt Hon. Prime Minister, His Excellency Amama Mbabazi, to specifically go item by item on which areas Government concedes to and which areas in specific terms where they feel the tax should be maintained. I think that will bring some bit of order into his submission and it will be easy for Parliament to follow what he will be submitting. I would like to be guided on this, Mr Speaker.

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Procedurally even in engineering, which is the honourable member’s field, you start with the big picture then you go down to the details of the drawing. I thought that is the normal procedure even in science. You give the big picture then you come down to the specific issues you want to deal with. So the right honourable is proceeding correctly. He wants to give the big view and then he goes to the specifics. We are waiting.

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for that obvious wise ruling. So in designing the VAT proposals, careful due regard was taken to the impact on agriculture and the farmers especially the small scale farmers who sustain many households through the provision of food and employment.

When the exemptions on agriculture inputs were inserted into the VAT Act, colleagues you may recollect or those who were not here at that time may have discovered, that when this was done in the Financial Year 2001/2002 and in the VAT Act of 2001/2002 and in the Financial Year 2002/2003, it was intended that the benefit would trickle down to the farmers in the form of reduced process and quality supplies. Over time, this has not happened as the benefits have been enjoyed by the middlemen who have kept the prices high. 

The other example I can give is that only last year, although we have already - I am not renewing the debate now, Mr Speaker, but only recently I do not remember whether it is not two days ago when we removed the proposed excise duty on kerosene of Shs 200 - We did the same last year and the outcry then was, “Kerosene is for the ordinary person, for the poor. If you add tax, you are punishing the poor.” That was the argument so let us remove it. We removed it. Did the price go down? No, it did not. The price did not go down –(Interruption)

MR EKANYA: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The Rt Hon. Prime Minister is very much informed of the factors that determine prices. This country is one of the few countries in Africa that does not have an anti-competition law. The Ministry of Trade has been requested by Cabinet, by the East African Community, and in international meetings that we need a competition law so that we can regulate sectors that cheat our consumers. Therefore as Parliament, the clarification is, are you aware that one of the factors that is affecting prices is lack of a proper legal regime; the competition law?

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: Well, I am absolutely aware that there is free competition in Uganda; that we do not have price controls and that is why I was making the point that last year, when we removed Shs 200 from Kerosene, it did not reduce the price by Shs 200 or even by Shs 50. So who benefited from this? The people who benefited from this are the oil companies; it was not the poor and yet – (Interruptions) – let me make my presentation. I will give you all the time that the Speaker gives me to clarify. I am well informed as hon. Okot Ogong knows. 

When the exemptions were introduced, they were supposed to benefit ordinary people but they didn’t. There has not been a discernable increase in the use of exempted or zero rated inputs since the incentives were put in place. For example, it is reported as we heard from someone here that four percent of farmers use pesticides; and only two percent use fertilizers. This is testimony that it is not the tax that had stopped farmers from using these inputs –(Interjections)– it is not. 

The exemptions have been used by unscrupulous people; they receive all these inputs free of tax and then sell the products without tax and cutting honest business and also evading income tax. 

The presence of exemptions on a number of goods and services facilitates persons engaged in commercial activity like farming not to register for VAT; and this is a very important point. This makes them invisible to Uganda Revenue Authority so that they avoid meeting their tax obligations. 

Mr Speaker, we all know very well that our revenue collection is only 13 percent of the GDP; it is extremely low. We are lower than Burundi – we are lower than all the countries around us. It is because of the policies we have, which make people invisible to the tax authorities. 

I made a statement when I was addressing the international community in some place that 85 percent of our economy depends on the informal sector, and that informal sector contributes zero to the tax collection – (Interjections) – it is absolutely correct. 

So the presence of these exemptions facilitates persons engaged in commercial activity even in that informal sector not to register for VAT and therefore they become invisible to URA; that is a fact – (Interruption) 

MR MUWANGA: Mr Speaker, is the hon. Prime Minister in order to read a paper which he has not circulated to Parliament. I have critically looked at him and all the time, he is reading text, which he has not circulated to Members of Parliament. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Prime Minister is the Leader of Government Business and he speaks for all sectors of government and he gets briefs from all sectors of government. So, he is just making a concern reference to his notes –(Laughter)– please allow the member to speaker.

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: Thank you very much; you are of course 100 percent correct. (Laughter) You are right and I will be referring to some –(Interjections)– you want me to give you this; these are my notes; reference points. VAT as you all know does not tax investment but consumption. A person who is economically active and registers for VAT can claim VAT incurred on inputs and therefore incurs no tax imagine but passes it on to the final consumer. 

A person who is not registered for VAT and buys inputs which are Vated absorbs the VAT as cost of production. The result of the numerous exemptions and zero ratings is that agriculture has been contributing dismally to the revenue effort only at 0.3 percent of GDP. Yet its contribution to GDP should be 26.2 percent. 

The removal of these specific exemptions will ensure that possible abuse and collusion is alleviated and encourage farming businesses to use the VAT deferment skills applicable for all businesses. This will also assist farming enterprises not to pay VAT on other machinery like generators and packaging and sealing equipment, which they could not access. 

The measures are aimed at generating revenue, simplifying the tax system and easing the tax administration burden. You may note that the compliance gap notes study report highlighted tax exemptions as one of the main causes of our tax to GDP ratio which I have referred to. 

Colleagues, streamlining the exemptions will assist government to collect more revenue to provide the necessary public services. It is also a way of ensuring that economic households become more formal; that agriculture is not frowned upon as a calling for the uneducated and peasants, but looked at as a commercial enterprise. Only then can we proudly talk about Uganda being an agricultural country. 

Mr Speaker, taxation should not be looked at as a punishment. It is aimed at pooling resources together for the provision of infrastructure: power, education, health and so on as you know them. In areas where government has improved infrastructure like in West Nile –(Interruption) 

MR WADRI: Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I wish to thank the Rt Hon John Patrick Amama Mbabazi; you know, we have that relationship which we must cultivate right now. As clarification, the Prime Minister made reference to West Nile after saying that taxation should not be seen as a punishment. Here is a situation where we are talking about peasants, who value each and every coin that comes into their possession. In this case, therefore, when you tax them on things like axes, hoes and so on which are the most basic tools of production, surely won’t that be infringing on the little that the people have and being so punitive to them? That is the clarification I want to seek from the Rt Hon. Prime Minister.

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: I was making the point that in areas where infrastructure has improved like in West Nile, this improvement –(Interjections)– I don’t have to elaborate because hon. Kassiano Wadri did not dispute it; by his statement, he actually affirmed what I am saying because if what I am saying is not true, he would have said so; he didn’t.

Anyway, in areas where Government has improved the infrastructure, this improvement in turn has helped to reduce the cost of doing business. This is obvious. For example, farmers are now able to reach markets and sell their produce at good prices –(Interjections) – because they have good roads.

Where we have power – you know the impact of power; I don’t have to say that – taxes cannot solve the problem of distribution. This is done through expenditure measures and not taxation. The beneficiaries of the exemptions introduced, as I said before in 2001/2002 financial year aided or benefited the middlemen as evidenced by high prices and low usage of fertilisers and pesticides that I have referred to –(Interruptions)

MR OKOT-OGONG: Rt Hon. Prime Minister, thank you for giving way. I want to inform you that I am a student of economics. I know that you are a lawyer and so, please allow me to inform you in this area. (Laughter)

Rt Hon. Prime Minister, taxation can be used as a measure of income distribution. It can also be used as a measure to reduce the gap between the poor and the rich. In this case, Rt Hon. Prime Minister, you are aware that some big companies like BIDCO have not been paying VAT – actually many taxes: Excise Duty, VAT and so on for over 10 years. Also many companies have been exempted yet they are rich and gaining from the poor. But in your own wisdom, you now want to generate the money you are thinking of from the very poor instead of the rich? 

Are you aware that taxes that BIDCO has not paid are to the tune Shs 500 billion every year? But you now want to get Shs 215 billion from the peasants! Steel Milling Corporation has not been paying VAT and this is in the tune of Shs 153 billion. Why don’t we get that money from the rich so that we can redistribute income and reduce the gap between the rich and the poor? (Applause) This is real economics and it is clean economics. 

Therefore, Rt Hon. Prime Minister, I want to advise that – no, I want to inform you that also in economics, one can use taxation to impoverish the poor and exactly, this is what you are doing. (Applause)

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: You know it is true that many years ago, the hon. Okot-Ogong had aspirations. (Laughter) He announced that he had aspirations and offered to run for presidency. Now he offered me the position of running mate, which I accepted. (Laughter) But this was as sideline talk. He did not get into the field –(Interruptions)

MR OKOT-OGONG: Mr Speaker, my good friend the Rt Hon. Prime Minister is aware that I presented myself under the NRM. I was nominated and he is aware of that. My name was also presented in the CEC and you are aware about the provisions of our Constitution that it is CEC that vets the candidates. You are a member of that CEC –(Laughter)– and he is the person I nominated to be my running mate, but who actually eliminated my name –(Laughter)– from the list.

Mr Speaker, is the Rt Hon. Prime Minister in order to misinform Parliament when he is aware of all the facts? (Laughter)

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Honourable members, what came to the public is not what was decided on in CEC. What came to the public is what was decided on in Namboole. To the best of my recollections somebody who has lived in this country, I do not recall any information to the effect that the hon. Okot-Ogong stood as a candidate in Namboole –(Laughter)– because that was the only information that was made public. (Laughter)

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: Mr Speaker, I really had a hearty laugh – hon. Okot-Ogong is my very good friend as you know. Anyway, the growth in domestic revenue has been largely attributed to a stable tax policy and modern and more efficient tax administration. In addition, Government commitment towards the improvement of infrastructure and general service delivery has played a key role by encouraging voluntary compliance from taxpayers.

There are however still a number of challenges that limit faster growth of tax revenue collections to enable Government accelerate economic development: The reduction in trade taxes contributions from about 52 per cent to 45 per cent of total taxes due to general reduction in tariffs arising from regional integration outside our own control as a country and globalisation. The large informal sector which I have spoken of especially agriculture. You know that agriculture contributes about 24 or 26 percent to GDP but two percent to tax. Construction contributes 13 percent to GDP but two percent to tax. Agriculture contributes 26 percent to GDP but 0.3 percent to tax. Real estate contributes six percent to GDP but only two percent to tax. Education contributes five percent to GDP but one percent to tax and hotels contribute five percent to GDP but only 0.9 percent to tax. Obviously there is a problem, let me quickly go through the various measures. 

The committee opposes the removal of exemption of supply of packaging materials for cereals. The exemption of VAT on packaging materials for cereals was an unfair tax policy that created a competitive advantage for imports over domestically produced packaging materials. This has curtailed the growth of the packaging industry in Uganda leading to loss of job opportunities for our people. A producer in Uganda would pay VAT on the raw materials, power and water needed in the production process. This VAT then would form part of the price charged to the consumer. 

However, the imported packaging material from say China or India will not bear any VAT as imports are relieved from VAT from the country of export. The result is that the price of Ugandan packaging materials will be higher than imported therefore that industry will their jobs will go with it. Therefore agriculture will suffer because those who grow the raw material for cereals cannot find a market – (Interruption)

MR EKANYA: Mr Speaker, the Rt Hon. Prime Minister has raised a very serious matter that this House needs to look at it and if he can convince us, it is Government that imposes import tax. It depends on the agreement at WTO and the partner countries but I do not think we have a trade agreement with China, for example.

To me, we need to support local manufacturers of packaging materials and therefore we want you to come out clearly and honestly. If low quality packaging materials are coming from India and China the best way forward is for us to increase the tax on imports so that we can support local manufacturers. Are you telling us that Government hands are tied and therefore the only way forward is to impose by removing exemption? You need to come out clearly so that we are more educated and support you.
 
MR AMAMA MBABAZI: As the honourable member knows we now apply a common external tariff as East Africa. We agree on these, we don’t impose anything outside this arrangement as a country. That is the arrangement we have as a community. In the East African community itself – (Interruption)

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Speaker, I want to thank the Prime Minister for giving way. Your statement of china, that those goods which come from China are relieved of VAT when they are exported from that country to here it means we should impose VAT. When we impose VAT, it means that when they sell them in the market, those who have imported will claim VAT on those materials.

Why are they cheaper, it means our cost of production in Uganda, for us to be able to match China, because these are imported, there are transport costs and they have entered Uganda, for them to be cheaper, there must be a method of allowing them so that the production costs are cheap to be able to compete with those which have been imported. What about the cost of our materials being expensive, that makes cost of production to be high. Now here we come, electricity which has VAT and water - if we want our locals to compete favourably with these imported goods, we should find another method to deal with it but not VAT. Because VAT even if we impose it now it means that they will charge VAT and/on their input they will make allowable but are they going to compete favourably with the one from China. And that is why I want to get the facts before I can support you.

In that regard as an economist and as an accountant – (Interruption)
 
MR AMAMA MBABAZI: I can discuss that detail to have figures rather than presumptions but as you all know China has become the manufacturing centre of the world; their goods are consumed in America and in the European market. These are mostly now produced in China because of low production costs. They have skilled labour, they have materials, cheaper labour costs compared to other areas and of course China has built such an economy that it has the capacity to subsidise.

China has a Government that is in absolute control as you know. I would like to have the time and the opportunity when we have all the details to debate that point. So, I was giving the example of East Africa. In the East African Community, it was only Uganda that exempted packaging materials from VAT and that disadvantages our local manufacturers. This practice also distorted the VAT system, complicated administration in determining whether the materials were actually used for the intended purpose.

Applying VAT on the packaging materials will create a neutral tax system and competition will be driven, not by tax but by other factors of production as I have been mentioning in the case of China. This will help promote the local industry and create jobs and grow our tax base.

You may recall that in the Financial Year 2010/2011, we exempted the supply of bio-gradable materials from VAT. The manufacturers protested profusely this change because it disadvantaged them against imports. We eventually reinstated VAT on packaging materials in the Financial Year 2012/2013.

Therefore, we think that the imposition of VAT on this particular item is justifiable and I hope, honourable members, you can see that and support it.

The other one that I wanted to comment on is the removal of VAT exemption on the supply of foods for poultry and livestock –(Interruption)

MS BAKO: Mr Prime Minister, clarification on that one. Mr Speaker, when you hear of the highest losses that farmers in this country encounter are post-harvest losses and those are matters related to harvesting and storage and the Prime Minister is aware of this. 

Therefore, Mr Prime Minister, through the Speaker, do you think that by imposing this tax you are not actually worsening the situation of post-harvest loss and production?

Secondly, when you are talking about levying these taxes, are you aware that it is this agricultural sector that actually backwardly and forwardly links with the industrial sector that you are talking about? And also that an imposition of such a levy will jeopardise industrialisation aware that more than 70 percent of your domestic industries are agriculture based?     

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Rt Hon. Prime Minister, I was just thinking that there seems to be an agreement that the principles of the Bill are okay because even the committee proposes some amendments to this, and you are also proposing that also at a certain stage, you may be considering giving in on some issues. I am just wondering whether we will not be able to do that better when he go to the committee stage so that your other explanation are specific to an item before we take a decision. So would that be okay?

HONOURABLE MEMBERS: Yes. 

THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: So can I put the question for the motion of the second reading of the Bill? Honourable members, now I put the question to that motion that the Bill entitled, “The Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2014” be read the second time. 

(Question put and agreed to.)

BILLS
COMMITTEE STAGE

THE VALUE ADDED TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2014

Clause 1

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, we need to defer Clause 1 because we may take decisions that we need to see how to handle the commencement clause properly. So let us stand over Clause 1 which is on commencement. 

Clause 2

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: There is no amendment from the chairman on Clause 2 of the Bill. The amendment I have on the report is on Clause 3.

MR EKANYA: What is Clause 3?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Just proceed.

MR EKANYA: On Clause 2 of the Bill that we have is amending Section 28 of CAP 349.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: And what is that law?

MR EKANYA: This is where I want the intervention of the Prime Minister because he was talking about harmonization of tax regimes as a result of the regional integration, EAC and COMESA which has direct impact. For example, I can tell you that in the harmonisation, some of these countries were supposed to get benefits as you know compensation which they have not got. Kenya and Tanzania have not harmonised. I have been writing a note to the Minister for Trade so that we move in tandem. If Kenya, Tanzania and all these countries have harmonised and if they have not, then we also stay so that you can continue with the negotiation. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: This is an amendment on CAP 349 which is what?

MR EKANYA: Your technical people have the red book and they can help you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: CAP 349 is the Value Added Tax Act. The proposal is to amend Section 28 (7) of the Value Added Tax Act by substituting for the reference to sub-section (9) and (10) the reference to sub-section (8) and (9). In (b) by substituting sub-section (11) (b) with the following - and so the amendment in (a) is about renumbering or cross referencing. In (b), it is about substituting sub-section (11) (b). So what does (11) (b) say? Can the chair please help us with this? What is the impact of this because – does it have the impact or the effect of what the shadow minister is saying or it is a different situation?

MR SSEBUNYA: I think it was for correcting referencing. It has no financial impact unless he has a particular amendment he wants to-

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: What does section 28(11)(b) as of now say in the law?

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Chairman, I want to help my chairman. The old law used to be called the East African Customs and Transfer Management Tax Act (1970) but since we amended that to the East African Community Customs Management Act (2004) that is the reason why we are removing the one of 1970 to the one of 2004.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: So there is no problem?

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: No problem.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: For the whole of clause 2. Can I put the question to clause 2? I put the question.

(Question put and agreed to.)

Clause 2, agreed to.

Clause 3

MR SSEBUNYA: Mr Chairman, clause 3; amendment of the Second Schedule to the principal Act. In paragraph (a) substitute for (d) the following: (d) the supply of micro insurance, health insurance, life insurance and re-insurance services. The justification is to exempt micro insurance and re-insurance services from VAT. This is because we reasoned that those are for low income earners.

MR OMACH: Mr Chairman, I have no objection.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Okay, so we are substituting what is in 3(a)(d) of the Bill. The proposal from the chair is that 3(a)(d) in the Bill be deleted and in its place we have clause 3- Because we have 3(a) and in 3(a), there is a proposed amendment in (d) so the chair has proposed that in (d) we delete what is in the Bill and substitute for that what he has just read, which is the supply of micro insurance, health insurance, life insurance and re-insurance services. What was the justification?

MR SSEBUNYA: We said those were for low-income earners. They were targeting low income earners.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: So-

MS BAKO: Mr Chairman, I think the chairman of the committee is very unserious. For example-

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: No, you do not make those kinds of statements.

MS BAKO: I apologise for that. Mr Chairman, how many poor people take health insurance in this country that this is to be exempted? Would it therefore be justifiable if Government is looking for tax and aware that actually our health insurance policy as a country failed to take off? How can this be a justifiable levy?

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Chairman, I want Members to understand. Many of you are on medical insurance, which is health insurance.  The moment you say it is not exempt, it means your medical insurance will be VAT inclusive. That means you cannot claim VAT when you have been paid the insurance. It also means that for you not to be charged health insurance, the law is saying we exempt insurance for health and life insurance from VAT. The insurance policy you will pay will be cheaper than if you put VAT because you cannot claim that VAT if it is taxed. That is what it means.

MR EKANYA: Mr Chairman, I want to plead with my brother, hon. Nandala-Mafabi. We need to balance the budget. Here we are talking for us who have health insurance; members of Parliament, civil servants and company employees. We also complained about hoes so between insurance, hoes and salt, which one do we go for?

I think Government needs to make concessions. I am a member of that committee and I think since Government is giving in, we need to give in also so that we pay VAT on that one.

MR TIM LWANGA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I believe that everybody would love to have health insurance and you cannot encourage other citizens to buy health insurance if it is expensive. It may not look very expensive for you as an honourable member of Parliament but it is very expensive for other people. If you put on another 18 percent, you are actually making those people who have got health insurance into an exclusive class and that is not what we should be doing. Therefore, we must exempt it. [Hon. Wadri rose_]

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Please state for me the issue you are rising on so that I know.

MR WADRI: Mr Chairman, still on the same issue.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Okay, contribution.

MR WADRI: Mr Chairman, my understanding is that this amendment that we are going through is not cast in stone. Every other financial year, we come with similar amendments and right from the presentation made by the RtHon. Prime Minister, he was trying to justify the need for people to pay taxes and appreciate it in view of the services that will be rendered arising from the monies obtained.

Here is a situation where we are saying, whatever taxes we approve must look to the common good and the wellbeing of the person who is paying the tax. Much as we would want to have health insurance across the board for everybody, the truth of the matter is that it is presently the affluent who can afford health insurance services. When we now look at those who are affluent and able to afford in comparison with the poor peasants who are now going to bear this – 

Because at the end of the day, I begin to imagine that our focus is on raising taxes and we are going to lump this on the poor peasants who constitute the majority hence the reason why we are of the opinion that let the affluent few who can afford health insurance services be taxed so that we are able to exempt the majority poor; the peasants who do not have anywhere to recoup money in order to purchase production tools. We really need to be very conscious of this.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Honourable chairman, let the House understand what was being proposed here. Was it to exempt or to bring it back within the bracket of VAT? What is the purpose of this amendment, which is proposed?

MR SSEBUNYA: Mr Chairman, if we look at the Second Schedule, which is on exempt supplies, there is the supply of insurance services. It is in exempt but now to exempt, they are proposing to single out the supply of health insurance and life insurance. The ministry is proposing that. For us, we only added micro insurance and why we added this is because the industry came to us and appealed that their business was being rendered useless because they are no longer getting even the little profit they were getting. So, the ministry is proposing that they only release the supply of health insurance to encourage Ugandans to take it at leisure and also to come on board, and also life insurance. Those two are exempt from – 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, from what I understand, initially the entire insurance business was exempt from VAT; now the proposal in the Bill is saying, instead of exempting the entire range of insurance services, they only now would like to exempt health and life insurance. But the committee is saying no, do not stop there, add on micro insurance and re-insurance, which the minister has accepted. But I am wondering how re-insurance becomes for the poor because I thought it was a big business.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Chairman, those who have been around since we started may understand. We said reinsurance will be basically money which is paid and taken out and you are aware we put 15 percent withholding tax on reinsurance. Already, whoever is worried, these people have been taxed at 15 percent and if you try to put it under VAT again, it will be double taxation.

Two, life insurance, at least I am one of those who have taken life insurance – yes and you need it anyway -(Interjections)- it will not take me to that but it is for some protection. I know my brother hon. Odonga Otto is with me. Even the life insurance we are talking about in Uganda, there is no company which does life insurance. All the money – for example, when you go to NIC and pay, all of it will be re-insured and all of it goes out and everybody will agree that even if you have put life insurance, all of it is going to be externalised and it will be at 15 percent withholding tax. The only thing which is new was micro insurance. This is this small – like the motor cycle insurance, these tiny ones – (MEMBERS: “Third party”) Now if you put 18 percent tax on that, you know what will happen. That means the policy you will buy for motor cycles will go high. That is the meaning of micro insurance here.

What I am proposing here my brother, hon. Odonga, for now as it stands, it is fine because there is no one who is going to run away from the bracket – they have already been charged 15 percent withholding tax. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Hon. Members, what it means is that we since the minister agrees, we will leave the position which is in the Bill and if we are going to discuss, we discuss what is proposed by the committee. Is that correct? So, if you are making a contribution, make it in relation to micro-insurance, health insurance, life insurance and re-insurance services.

MS BAKO: Thank you, Mr Chairman. With specific reference to health insurance, these are mainly companies and everyone here takes either AAR or IAA or whatever it is – 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: No, is that life insurance?

MS BAKO: No, I am talking about health insurance. If we look at the income segment that we are talking about, these are people with the capacity to pay and to exempt them – and by the way, most of the people who get health insurance get it in part because they work for these corporations which have the capacity to pay. Therefore, to imagine that they should be exempted is – (Interruption)

MR NASASIRA: Mr Speaker, I am raising on a point of procedure on how we move. The minister proposed a clause; the committee looked at the Bill, brought an amendment after thorough discussion and consultations in the industry – the minister has accepted the amendments, do we really need to take more time on this?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Whatever has happened outside Parliament has got to be approved by this Parliament for it to become in effect. The question that is being raised by the Member for Aruais specifically on health insurance. The ministry had proposed that it be exempted, the committee has also confirmed that it should be exempted – she is asking what justification is being given for exempting particularly health insurance – not re-insurance, micro-insurance, not life but health insurance. 

MR MUWANGA KIVUMBI: I think in the whole of this debate, there is some cardinal principle we are all missing. I will speak as a professional economist. There is what we call disposable income. This income is in most economies, what is taxable income because you can dispose of it. But then there is income but geared towards production, for example I have earned some income but I am going to use it to buy a machine. It would be imprudent to put a tax because it will inherently enhance more production. 

When you come to health insurance, this is money affordable by the affluent and they can part with it. It is not basic health. It is insurance – something people who have excess money out there and they can insure their health. So it is some kind of money that can attract a tax and it is not imprudent to place a tax on health insurance other than - because we are creating a balance – we are going to go out there and make a case for the hoe, for seeds because for us this is income towards production. 

In my humble opinion, and I would like to persuade this Parliament, let us target areas that inherently, people can dispense money with – there we go for the rich. It is okay for my good friend here, Nasasira, you and your family can afford to pay for health insurance because you have the money.

MR MUSASIZI: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I want to appreciate the arguments being put forward by our colleagues and I also want to say that insurance business is a new business in Uganda. It is something that is emerging. (Interjections) wait I am still emphasising my point. I want to inform this House that there are insurance companies that have gone beyond targeting the rich and are now looking at the poor under group insurance arrangements. There is an insurance company called Pax insurance; what this company is doing is organising poor people into groups. You gather 3,000, 5,000 or 1,000 put this money in a pool and buy an insurance cover as a group for health. I want to say that I have over 50 groups covered under health group insurance by Pax Insurance in my constituency.

Honourable colleagues, when you pay for a service you expect to get it and why I am telling you this is that this service is being enjoyed by even the poor people. So, what we need to do as leaders is to encourage more people to get to this service. We need to encourage people to appreciate insurance arrangement. But if we –(Interruption)

MS BAKO: Thank you very much, colleague, for giving way. I would like to imagine that you are speaking in your capacity as somebody who did very basic economics at least. But when you get individuals and you aggregate their capacity, what that means is that they are now potentially rich enough to absorb the shock. It also means that the income that has been aggregated can be taxed because it is no longer the individual’s; it is the aggregated capacity and income. So, that can as well be taxed because it is no longer an income that is pegged to an individual but an aggregated community.

MR MUSASIZI: Thank you, honourable colleague, for the information. But it is unfortunate that most of our colleagues are against this point yet without health, one cannot do anything. How I would wish to see every Ugandan getting into the insurance health arrangement. But how do we achieve this? We do this by subsidising health insurance.

I appeal to you, honourable colleagues, to look at this matter from a wider perspective. We need to go beyond people who are rich and look at the poor. I think this proposal is aimed at bringing the poor into the bracket. Thank you.

MR ODOI: Thank you, Mr Chairman. Can I be protected from the hon. Odonga Otto; he is making allegations that I am a Sudanese. Thank you.

In respect to health insurance, I think we need to start from the government policy. The policy is to provide free medical services to all Ugandans. If you have the affluent members of your society who opt out of the universal free medical services by purchasing medical insurance, you achieve two things. One is you relieve yourself of the burden of catering for a much bigger number of your population. This means you can re-invest that money to better the services you give to the remaining population. 

Two, you will have your citizens capable of looking after themselves. So, to exempt them from the VAT would be a service to the general community. And in that regard, Mr Chairman, I think we should support this idea.

MR BAHATI: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. I think it is necessarily true that health insurance is for the rich as we talk. The majority of the people in this bracket are actually people who are struggling and working for companies. They get these services as extra support. These are people in companies – hon. Christine Bako, when you take a count of people who are paying for insurance by themselves, you realise they are very few. Even us here, I don’t know how many of us would afford health insurance if we were not being supported by government.

So, I think it is important - we can tax anything and everything – we canvass support for this health insurance so that we can have it spread to the people who cannot afford it. Time will come for us to think about ourselves. I think that hon. Christine can rethink about this situation so that the House can move on in regard to this issue.

MR ODONGA OTTO: Thank you, Mr Chairman. When the hon. Tim Lwanga spoke, I thought it was the right time to put the question. But anyway, the hon. Fox Odoigalvanised it better. People who have opted to go for private health providers are relieving Government of some responsibility. Now that they are there – they run to places like AAR and so they may not necessarily run to Mulago, which is a government facility. So, I think it would not be good manners for Government to run after them to be taxed for relieving it of the burden of looking after them. In any case, if they are taxed, that will discourage others from joining those schemes. For example, I carry an iPhone but many Ugandans are using Nokia phones and if you encourage them to access internet through this phone but you are taxing them, they will run to the phones that cannot afford internet services. So, they will remain using Tecno phones for ever. (Laughter) So, instead the tax on this phone should be reduced so that more people can jump on board. That is the same principle when transferred to the health insurance scheme.

So, for now, it is still too early and so we should not sound as if we should also be taxed. No, we should be encouraging others to join this scheme.

MS ALASO: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. I think it is important that we support the position of the committee. I would like to implore my colleagues largely because – I would like to address my colleagues on two issues. We all know the challenges of the health sector in Uganda. As we talk, it might require some time and more funds to sort out the challenges in the health sector. So, given the fact that majority of people at least, when they get insured by the companies they work for, can then afford meaningful health services, then we should encourage that segment.

Two, one of the success stories I think – and I may be reminded – on maternal health delivery is the story of an NGO somewhere in western Uganda that procures health insurance for expectant mothers. And all of us have been craving for that opportunity for the grass root community. So, again I think that along those lines, we should do what it takes to encourage the health insurance arrangement.

The only challenge I have thought about is that if the honourable minister would shoot up the next minute and says he wants it as a trade-off that would be my problem. Otherwise, as of now, so that I don’t even move in anticipation – I think it is extremely important –(Interruption)

MS FRANCA AKELLO: Thank you, hon. Alaso, for giving way. Mr Chairman, the point hon. Alaso is trying to stress is very true. I would like to give her information that just next door in Rwanda, Government subsidises insurance so when we say do not tax, it is almost equivalent to subsidising the insurance so really it would be a good idea.

MS ALASO: Thank you for that information. The other thing I would like to remind the House is that over the years, we have been allocating some money to ministry of health to see if we can have an affordable insurance facility for all ordinary Ugandans. I think that just to stimulate and encourage uptake of health insurance, let us support the position of the committee

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Hon. Member, please let her make the point then you raise your concern because we are lengthening this.

MS ALASO: I would like to implore Members to allow for the informal sector, the unemployed to file affordable insurance which is tax exempt. The risk we are also having is to look at ourselves as members of Parliament, insurance is provided by Parliament even if we provided for VAT on health insurance,the taxpayers will pay for us. But let’s shift away from ourselves and look at the ordinary people who have to afford it away from the corporation and I think that will move this thing forward.

MS SANTA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I am reliably informed that Government is proposing social insurance for all the citizens; I am informed by a member of the committee who sits on the committee on health. I do not know whether we are proceeding well because we are saying that there are few people who are getting this insurance through their companies. Again we shall move forward and we see that there are few people who are also using fertilisers, pestcides. I do not know whether when we reach there, we are going to apply the same principle.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: The House is not supposed to debate in anticipation. Hon. Member, you access the microphone before you are given the authority that affects my recording of the Hansard. When you say ‘chair’ in the middle of a sentence, how will they read it? You need to access the microphone once you have been allowed to speak because they are recording verbatim what is going on. The Speaker is speaking and another party is saying chair, chair. I had picked the member for Dokolo District.

MS CECILIA OGWAL: Mr Chairperson, I think I would want you to guide me and quite a number of us. Because what the right hon. Prime Minister put to us made me think twice how we should proceed. We should look at the VAT globally and look at where we can concede and where we can hold on to the report.

In my view, I am more interested in the 80 percent bracket of the population who have to go for hoes for peasant farming vis-a-vis the two holes in Luo Keri, in case you cannot understand my English properly. I am looking at the 88 percent population bracket who have to go for hoes in order to live in the peasantry sector of the economy vis-à-vis the 1 percent or 0.8 percent according to what has been discovered recently about the people who are going for health insurance.

We are saying can we allow VAT on the 1 percent population who are going for health insurance because that is not the general population. Can we allow VAT on insurance because as of now, Government cannot afford to insure the entire population of Uganda so we have a component of our population to go for health insurance? But 88 percent of the population use hoes for survival. So we are saying, can we exempt taxation on hoes and allow taxation on this small component. That is how I am looking at it. I am looking at it from a global perspective based on the findings that are put to us. If the findings are genuine, can we adopt agive and take approach? That is where I would have given in, and that is what I would have pursued.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Hon. Minister, why do you want to exempt health insurance? 

MR OMACH: Mr Chairman and colleagues, the country is moving towards having insurance cover for health for almost everybody so we are accepting the proposal that is being made by the committee. We had only talked of health and life, now they are also including micro-insurance and reinsurance and that is what hon. Nandala-Mafabi mentioned. Yesterday, we did impose 15 percent withholding tax on re-insurance so to have it again put here would be double taxation.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Health insurance.

MR OMACH: As I have already mentioned, we are moving towards having health insurance under the ministry of health. We have done base mark studies in Tanzania and Rwanda and they are almost covering all the local people in the country. So that is why we are proposing this.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Hon. Members, if the minister should lose on other matters, he would have lost this one on his own agreement so he cannot blame the House on it. So can I put the question to the amendment by the committee? We have had sufficient debate on this health insurance.

MR EKANYA: Thank you very much, Mr Chair. I want to thank you very much for the word of wisdom to the hon. minister. If he was in the same hall with you, he would have understood your statement very clearly and I would have thought that we stand over this until we finish. I want to seek clarification from hon. Nandala.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Hon. Member, hon. Nandala is not holding the Floor. No, you know the rules.

MR EKANYA: Okay, let me seek clarification from the hon. minister. Withholding tax you know is refundable so when we imposed withholding tax, it is held and once you comply, then it is refundable-(Interjections)- therefore, even this 15 percent, that we have – and yesterday, we were very categorical; we exempted three companies that are indigenous.  (Interruption)

MS FRANCA AKELLO: Thank you, Mr Chairman. Is my Minister of Finance in order to mislead this House?

THE CHAIRPERSON: Which minister of finance?

MR FRANCA AKELLO: Mine.

HON. MEMBERS: Shadow minister. 

MS FRANCA AKELLO: My shadow minister of finance.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: You have only one minister of finance. (Laughter)

MS FRANCA AKELLO: Okay, the shadow minister of finance. Is he in order to mislead this House that withholding tax is refundable, yet withholding tax is held by a company which is – it is collecting the tax on behalf of Government.

So, is it in order for him to really insinuate that because of the withholding tax, the tax on insurance is going to be affected?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, withholding tax does not have the interpretation attached to it by the word “withholding”. It simply means tax that is taken in advance, but not for refund. You do your own books, deduct the taxes, and at the right time, you remit. So, it is not like you are going to refund it. No, but you deduct it from source upfront. (Members rose_) -no, it is not a debate.

MR NANDALA MAFABI: Mr Chairman –

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: No, withholding tax is not in our debate.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Chairman, we do not want to make our record look bad. This is how we want to help. If a foreigner withheld 15 percent, like the insurance, that is the final tax. Do not confuse the one of supplying locally here and then at the end of the year - the one here is 6 percent, the 15 percent withholding tax is a final tax on those who do insurance.

So, Mr Chairman, it will not be a refund neither will it be claimed because that person outside does not file his income tax returns here in this country.

MS BAKO: Mr Chairman, I find the argument of the minister of finance very wanting. First of all, he is saying one of the reasons why this exemption is good is that government is moving towards unilateral or universal health insurance, but this has not taken off.

And since it has not taken off, will this exemption, in one way or the other, be the blue stick to getting there? For now, no. Now, what is the current situation? How much is government targeting from this exemption?

If the definition is not clear, therefore, if a levy is on this insurance, that means the rich are paying to have health services for the poor and that is going to be the distribution of income that we want from this tax.

So, I find that wanting and yet he tells me that at that material time, when government has fully gone into provision of health insurance for everybody, then this exemption can come on board. If we cannot legislate in anticipation, why must we fund in anticipation?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, I will put the question to the amendment proposed by the committee to sub clause 3(a). The committee has proposed that amendment and I will now put the question to that amendment.

(Question put and agreed to.)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: So, the amendment is now to the effect that the supply of micro-insurance, health insurance, and insurance services, that is what the records now capture in the place of what is 3(a).Is there any amendment on (b)?

MR SSEBUNYA: Mr Chairman, I think in our report, it was supposed to be in paragraph (z) and we are proposing to delete (hh), which stands for supply of packaging materials exclusively used by the milling industry for packing milled products. (Members rose_)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Let us handle this first. On this one, honourable minister.

MR OMACH: I do not accept the proposal raised by the committee. This exemption, the VAT is not charged on the output. On the input, it is paid. So, when a producer produces an item, and the item is exempt, that means that when he is selling, he will not be able to collect the VAT on the output and so, it will make the packaging material in Uganda more expensive than those which have come from outside.So, we would rather that this remains as we had suggested before. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the issue is that the committee is proposing that the supply of packaging materials exclusively used for the milling industry for packing milled products should be exempt. That is what the committee is proposing. Is that correct?

MR SSEBUNYA: Mr Chairman, because some of these reports are written by – I think the committee did not intend that- because the justification in my report says the industry still needs support, then if it needs support, then it should be exempt. That is exactly what I had asked.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Mr Chairman, I think as the chairman of the committee is raising, there must be a problem. That is the reason we are seeing paragraph (b) down. It is being repealed, it should be deemed to have come in force in 2010. What it means here is that if I supply packing materials for milk, and I am exempt, any VAT I pay cannot be claimed.

It becomes a cost of production and you just add it on top so that means instead of being – for simplicity, let us assume the cost was Shs 1 million, with VAT, it will be Shs 1,180,000. Now, if I am VAT exempt, the cost will be Shs 1,180,000. If I am taxable, it means the cost will be Shs 1 million because the Shs 180,000 will be my input which will be claimed and if it is claimable, it means my cost is Shs 1 million.

I think the minister has not explained it very well. When you make a supply taxable, the cost of production does not include the VAT input – why? because it will be claimed. If you make it exempt, it means the VAT you pay on inputs becomes part of the cost of production.

So, on this one, because if you can see the (b) down, when Finance tried to make the – bio-gradable exempt, they said no, when you make it, our cost of production goes high. So, they said, they had to reset it. In the same regard of the bio-degradable, if we want to help the milk sector industry, I want to tell the milk people not to get worried, it will make your materials cheaper than when it is exempt.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: So in other words, you are disagreeing with what the committee has proposed.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: What the committee chairman is saying is not what we meant because the report had technical issues. Mr Chairman, you remember you called us to bring those reports very fast and that is where the error - there is another error you will see as we proceed. So we agree with the minister’s proposal because that is the only way to make this industry-

MR MUSASIZI: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I am also a member of the Finance Committee and when the chairman presented the proposal, I became confused because in the committee, all our arguments were tending towards agreeing with the proposal by Government. The reason-

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: No, at this time it is okay. Once you say you agree, we understand where you are because that is what the committee had agreed. So in (b), the discussion is saying there should be no amendment in paragraph (b). That is what I am gathering so far from the members of the committee –(Mr Ekanya rose_)- I have not gathered from you. I said what I have gathered so far is this so that we can understand where we are going.

MR LUGOLOOBI: Mr Chairman, I am a member of this committee and I just wanted to give testimony that we had agreed with the government position. Yes, that is what we agreed. The record may not have captured that but that is what we had agreed as a committee and I was there.

MR EKANYA: Procedure, Mr Chairman.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: No, just raise the issue you wanted to raise.

MR EKANYA: No, procedure Mr Chairman. You see under parliamentary practice, if there is any new standard that is not provided for in the rules and the chair or the Speaker accepts them, they form part of our rules. You had allowed us members to somersault after moving on the road to Damascus. You used that terminology the other day. However for a member who even signed the report, and under the new arrangement, we are supposed to sign against our names and also sign the report, to come to the House and accuse the technical people of forging a report, I find it improper. If a member wants to change his position, he should do so but to say that we discussed and debated and therefore what I presented is not in the report, I find it out of procedure.

MR SSEBUNYA: Can I give you information? The report is reading paragraph (b). When you read the Act, there is no paragraph (b) about the industry. So it should have been paragraph (z). Is that alleging that somebody has forged a report? Why don’t you first get the information then stand up? It is saying paragraph (b) which is supply of postage stamps.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: No, but it is paragraph (b) in the Bill.

MR BAHATI: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. First, I think members of the Finance Committee should really take advantage of the privilege the Speaker has given all of you to debate the report and leave what you did not agree with in the committee. Let us move on because by procedure, you are supposed to leave this report to us to use for information. 

Regarding VAT on packaging materials, I think as hon. Nandala-Mafabi has said, it is important that we leave it there for two reasons. One, if you exempt it, you are actually making this product more expensive than if you impose it because it will be a cost of production.

The second part is that there is a burden of administration. We are not going to differentiate whether these products are going to be applied for the purpose for which they were intended or not. So I think that for all of us who are supporting the farmers, it is important that we work in their interest and their interest is to make sure that the product is cheaper for them. Thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the justification the committee gives for deleting (H)(h) in this law is that the interest is still –(Interjections)– support but it turns out that actually for them to get that support, (H)(h) should be repealed. So that means we are on the same page. If that is the position, then there is no amendment in paragraph (b).

MR EKANYA: We have an amendment.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: A new amendment in paragraph 3(b) in the Bill?

MR EKANYA: Yes, on paragraph 3(b). I moved a minority report on (B)(F)(f) which is about salt. If we repeal (B)(F)(f), we are introducing VAT on salt and I also had some difference on (B)(C)(c) which is liquefied gas and I would request, Mr Chairman, that B(w) - since the government left money for computers that is about computer software, I think we can agree with Government because we have money now.

(u) is about tourist lodges and I think we agreed there. Chairman of the Committee of Finance, we agreed with you on the tourist lodges that they should pay the VAT on accommodation, that is B(u). Because that is where some people go to do their things but, Mr Chairman –(Interjections) - can I continue?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Please deal with the issue you want to deal with so that the record is clear. Hon. Ekanya, let me tell you something about amending laws. The Hansard people would have to go and extract what we have decided and prepare the assent copy of the Bill for the President’s signature. If you want to talk about (F)(f) and (C)(c), why do you go to (u) and other things, which are not relevant to your contribution? You confuse the Hansard and you end up confusing everybody. At this stage, Committee Stage is not for general talk. We are dealing with the law, which must be extracted properly. So please restrict yourself to what you want to comment on. 

MR EKANYA: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. (B)(F)(f) is about salt. (B)(C)(c) is about liquefied gas –

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: What do you want to do with it?

MR EKANYA: Mr Chairman, I would like to have these items remain as exempt because when we introduce-

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: You want to delete them from the Bill?

MR EKANYA: No, you see when we repeal them because Government is proposing to repeal, that is deleting, and when we delete, it will attract VAT. If a kilo of salt-

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: So you want to delete them from the Bill?

MR EKANYA: Yes, from this Bill.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: That is exactly what you should say.

MR EKANYA: Yes, from this Bill, so that it retains what is in the current Act. So, I would like that to be deleted from the Bill, and then (c) -

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: No, let us deal with this first - paragraph (b)

MR EKANYA: Paragraph (b); Mr Chairperson, we are proposing that in the Bill, (c)(c) and (f)(f) should be deleted. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: (F)(f) has to do with salt and cc has to with liquefied gas. So, you are proposing that they should be deleted from the Bill and retained in the Act.

MR EKANYA: Thank you.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: So, the proposal is clear –(Members rose_)- no, let us deal with this one.

MR LUGOLOOBI: Mr Chairman, we have been talking about tax as a measure for reducing inequalities. When we talk about liquified gas, cooking gas, this is gas that is not largely being used in the villages; it is largely being used by you and I, people who can afford the 18 percent tax. For now, as we speak, I think we can afford this tax. (Interjections) Yes, I know there are arguments relating to the environment and so on, but under the circumstances, where it is a give and take situation, I think this is one of the items where the people who are using liquefied gas can afford to pay the tax.

MS CECILIA OGWAL:  Mr Chairman, the chairman of budget committee is one of the very active members in protecting the environment and the chairman of the budget committee knows that right now, the entire population, particularly you who are in leadership are trying to nurture our rural population to move away from the use of firewood, charcoal burning and so on. And he is aware, he is one of those very active in that area.

So, I want to provide him with this information, that the reason we think we should not put tax on gas, is to make gas affordable for the rural women to abandon the use of charcoal, firewood but use gas instead.

We have to nurture, it is in our defence of the environment, but when you tax it, it becomes too expensive and unaffordable for the rural woman.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Honourable member for Dokolo District, are you suggesting that by removing this tax, my grandmother will start using gas in the village? (Laughter) please, let us be realistic.

MR LUGOLOOBI:  Mr Chairman, I was still holding the Floor. I thank you for the information but the honourable member may wish to know that NEMA today is ill-funded to actually deliver its services to the population and the measure we are undertaking is intended to forward more resources into the pool so that we can fund the activities of NEMA and the ministry of water and environment. We are trying to tax the rich in order that services can be delivered to everybody.

MS NYAKIKONGORO:  Thank you, Mr Chairman. I want to confirm what hon. Lugoloobi is saying that actually the gas we are talking about is used by most of you here, but remember the other day, taxes on paraffin were fought left and right thinking it was used by our women down there and therefore, for the win-win thing, I believe let us support this such that those who are using gas, those who have- especially gas in urban areas, in town, I believe it is mainly the men who are actually buying gas for their families, and so, it is not going to even help us to reduce environment degradation because it is a small population that is using gas, particularly, not even in all urban areas but specifically in Kampala.

So, I think we should not really exempt it.

MR ODONGA OTTO: Mr Chairman, I would not buy the arguments of hon. Amos Lugoloobi, so much. My mother, hon. Cecilia Ogwal, raised a good argument but she made a departure at the conclusion. Like judging from my own experience, where I live in a decent – I don’t want to say a house, I say palace - (Laughter) – the challenge is to find that there is a portion in that house where people will have to use charcoal and this happens in almost all our houses. Those lorries you find on the way carrying charcoal over 100 bags end here in our houses. And what is the problem because gas is too expensive for me, I would rather spend 60,000 buying a sack of charcoal and I will use it for one and a half months. Any yet the environment is going.

So, this is the time that the tax pattern should encourage people to start using gas - (Applause) - because if I can use gas, the demand for charcoal will go down in Kampala and people will not cut more trees. So, I really want to appeal to the house, even if it is the top class who are to be taxed, because you want to get money. Electricity is very expensive, gas should have tax exemption. I would like to appeal to Members to accept that.

MR WAMANGA-WAMAI: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. People should think of what is going on in this country’s environment. We have had landslides, because we have been cutting down trees, for timber, for firewood in the whole country. Look at Nakasongora, look at the north, everywhere, you see trucks bringing charcoal here. We are spoiling our environment, so, if we lower taxes on the gas, we are going to save our environment. 

Secondly, I would have even gone a step further – what we are talking about, government should have even subsidised the electricity because God gave us water, Nile and the British built Owen Falls Dam for us, but it was sold. Otherwise, Government should have even subsidised our electricity to be able to save the environment. So, we should lower taxes on the gas to save our environment, Mr Chairman.

MS BETTY AMONGI: Thank you, Mr Chairman. The honourable member moved two amendments and I want to speak on salt because I have realised that majority are speaking on gas. Mr Chairman, when an Alur person goes to the local market, they will ask for all the little coins they have out of selling either their tomato or whatever they have sold.

The first item on a rural person and majority being women will be salt. And then, paraffin number two, then match box, the rest they can forego. They will forego the gas, they will forego everything, but they will not forego salt.

When a local farmer who keeps cows in Mbarara, in Oyam, in Bundibugyo, in Kisoro, wants to feed or deal with the issue of a certain ailment, they will want their cow to lick salt. Therefore, I want to support the proposal that we should save salt from the items that the ministry wants to exempt, because if that is done, then you can see that I would be heading to trade and sacrifice gas for salt. I thank you.

MR OMACH: Mr Chairman and colleagues, we are ready to trade off supply of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and hoes, but salt – gas, only one percent of the population at the moment is using gas and if we are taxing sugar, soap, which are being used by the majority –(Interjections)– yes, the majority. So, I appeal to Members to –(Interruption)

MS BAKO: Thank you, Mr Chairman. Not so long ago, when we were talking about health insurance, the justification that the minister gave was that government is moving universal insurance. And now that it has come to salt and knowing that this is a very basic table need, the same minister is eating his own words by saying that he can only concede on seeds, as if seeds cannot be turned into food that will require salt.Is the minister therefore in order to play at the letter of double standards claiming the interests of Ugandans at heart?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Hon. Members, we should understand where the minister is coming from. He is looking for the revenue side of the budget. So, please excuse him when he does his best to do that. Please, don’t put him to order all the time because that will not be helpful. He is just doing his best to retain as much of the revenue side of what he has proposed as possible. So, let us understand him from that point.

MS CECILIA OGWAL: Mr Chairman, I am equally concerned about the pressure that the minister is undergoing. So, I would like to propose a compromise that in view of the importance of salt to the ordinary persons in Uganda, I am willing to concede on gas because I understand that the grandparent will take time to learn how to use gas and the chairperson gave me a very serious talk on that. So, I would wish to go with the majority and hope that the minister will agree to that position; we don’t levy any VAT on salt; I can concede on gas.

MR OMACH: Mr Chairman, I accept the hon. Barbara Ogwal’s position that we concede on gas; that gas should remain. The proposed VAT on salt will move the price of 500g from the current Shs 500 to Shs 549 and the revenue that will come out of this is about Shs 8 billion. 

So, I appeal to colleagues – the increase is very small yet in terms of revenues, Shs 8billion is quite substantial. So, I pray that we leave this to remain the way government is proposing.

MR EKANYA: Mr Chairman, kindly allow me move a point of procedure. I am the one who moved the amendment and I thought I needed to come to the table to give my position as you have always told us to do so. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I thought you are consulting with the Leader of Opposition.

MR EKANYA: No, we are not very close. (Laughter) Mr Chairman, the issue of environment and transferring costs to the future generation is a global issue. The Government of Uganda has signed an agreement with the World Bank that the way we compute our GDP to tax should be in the green computation. Therefore, the issue – in fact, one member proposed that Government needs to impose VAT on charcoal so that we can discourage – because the cost implication in terms of health is very high. So, I would like to plead with this House that we delete, from the Bill, the proposal by government to impose on (b), (c) and salt.

Mr Chairman, the Minister of Finance is seated next to the Minister of Health. The health cost of the lack of consumption of Salt – if you go to all these health centres – is more than Shs 50 billion. Children are suffering from Goitre – you can google this information out; it is available. So, why would you want to get Shs 8 billion at a cost of more than Shs 50 billion?

I want to plead with you, colleagues – we rather review our pay for the sake of the children in this country. Let me tell you – the people who suffer from Goitre are our children and our grandchildren. So, we need – (Interruption)

MR ANYWARACH: Thank you, hon. Ekanya, for giving way. The information I want to give is that if the hon. Minister for Finance looked at the Shs 8billion as more advantageous than saving our kids suffering from Goitre, it would mean that we are losing more in health costs but that aside, this is similar to what the ministry did to us the people of Nebbi. 

We procured a donation of two containers of shoes. The shoes were supposed to be supplied by a donor. The two containers got delivered but at the time when there were many strikes in schools. The shoes had been expected to help school going children from Zombo and Nebbi who move bear-footed from being struck by lightning and protected from soil infected worms. But these children were denied the opportunity to have those shoes distributed and even up to now, we don’t know where the shoes have gone but at the expense of Shs 80million tax that Government didn’t want to lose. But socially, how much did we lose in protecting our children –

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Hon. Member, did you rise on a point of information?

MR ANYWARACH: Yes and that is the information I wanted to give to the House.

MR EKANYA: Mr Chairman, that is a member of my network –(Interruption)

MS KAMATEEKA: Thank you, hon. Geofrey Ekanya for giving way and thank you, Mr Chairman. The minister is saying that we remove VAT on salt from 20 to 49 percent. But the normal practice is that as soon as Parliament announces a tax on an item – [MR MAFABI: “This is VAT”]- I know – Value Added Tax.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: But you are saying it is 49 percent. I thought VAT was 18 percent.

MS KAMATEEKA: The minister said that the VAT from salt will move the cost from 20 to 49 – not percent -(Interjections) – yes that one. The information I want to give is that as soon as information passes that the parliament has okayed the tax in a liberalized economy; government does not control the prices and so we cannot tell how much the salt will go for. That is the information I wanted to give and this will have adverse effects to the local person, the poorest of the poor who finds it so hard to raise even Shs 200 to buy salt.

MR OMACH: All I wanted was to inform Members that we are here as Government and not as Ministry of Finance and that is why the leader of Government Business did make clarifications here. I have made it clear that the proposal by Government is that a 500 kilogramme packet of salt would move from Shs 520 to Shs 549 and this is already on-going. The collection order which allows Government to collect for four months is already ongoing. 

MR EKANYA: Mr Chairman, we agreed to give ministers concession based on your guidance – that we are not going to go back to the collection order. That is some kind of give and take – we are going to say from the date the Bill will be assented to because we do not want to distort – so that we have a relief. Please, I know you do not want to be called hon. Omach Jachan, you are my good friend, so I will say Government strategically for your future.

I want to request Government – it is a very serious matter. I visited your constituency Mr Chairperson some time back – 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: You did not notify me.

MR EKANYA: No, I didn’t and I apologise. But I did that when I was campaigning for FDC Party President. In the rural shops, the products you find are salt, match boxes, paraffin and soap. Hon. Omach and Rt Hon. Prime Minister, Moses Ali, I beg that you consider my amendment. 

MR AKENA: Thank you, Mr Chairperson. On the matter of salt, I am having difficulties understanding the minister’s mathematics. [MR EKANYA: “He said we call him Government.”]- or government’s mathematics. If VAT is at 18 percent and we are going to move from Shs 520 to Shs 549, that is not 18 percent. Eighteen percent of Shs 520 will give you Shs 94 and when that is factored in with the lack of these Shs 10 coins – you can only find them in Shoprite, it is going to push it even further. So we may say here that we are coming from Shs 520 and I do not buy it anywhere at that and it will go to highest round figure. Here we are looking at around Shs 700 which would be the realistic price in the village, which will be a 40 percent increase in the price. Although we are targeting 18 percent, we will get a 40 percent increase.

On the issue of the natural cooking gas, the reality is that in most of our homes, we have the electric cooker, gas cooker and charcoal. As alternatives, when Umeme is not there, you have to get the alternatives and charcoal is considerably cheaper than gas. If you increase the price of gas, the one percent who are using gas will not become 5 percent. It might even reduce and more people will rely on charcoal.

I am honestly appealing to government – even though we are to concede, we can do that on the gas but the reality is that government should concede.

MR CADET: Thank you Mr Chairperson. Uganda is not yet a welfare state. When you look at the World Bank rankings, we are one of the poorest countries in the world. Some of us who come from the rural areas, whereas we might want to speak for the poor, which we do, what is the trend? From morning to evening, people are playing pool and drinking alcohol. (Interjections) That is the fact – and engaging in sports betting. There is no way you can convince me that Shs 29 or Shs 90 will bring devastating consequences to a poor man. When are we teaching our people to work? We are asking Government to provide this and that, but these are people who should also get the responsibility as they demand for free education –(Interruption)

MR ODONGA OTTO: Thank you for giving way. If you go to our villages, you will find sachets of waragi spread everywhere and you really see that this cannot be a person who will not afford salt.

But secondly and most importantly, I think Parliament must start thinking of even returning graduated tax because the level of unseriousness down with the people that you want to help – they are not facing the world. We may need to bring back the tax before people are given the national ID card. 

MR CADET: As I conclude, even when it comes to charcoal – how do we tax charcoal because it is not an informal type of trade and the poorest person on earth in Uganda is not using charcoal but firewood? I beg Members that we get the money to do other social services. Thank you. 

MR AYOO: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I think when we release the farmers from paying tax on hoes, seeds, then this Shs 90 on salt will not cause very serious problems. We ask Parliament that we concede except on those other things that we use for production to get us more money.

But also on gas, there are three alternatives: one is electricity; very few people are using electricity for cooking. Two is charcoal and then gas. Gas is now going at Shs 120,000 for 12.5 kilograms up from about Shs 96,000; that has increased in the last three months and it means within this financial year. Now, if we put additional charges, people will run away from gas and then they will go back to charcoal. I have used gas myself –(Interjections)– Yes, information.

MR LUGOLOOBI: The new price that you are quoting is as a result of introducing this tax because this tax is already in effect. I wanted to give you that information. So, if we are to take a decision to impose this tax, it will have no further implications apart from what is already in place.

MR AYOO: Thank you. If the increase in the price from about Shs 96,000 to Shs 120,000 is as a result of the introduction of 18 per cent VAT, then we are already paying that and we would trade it off with salt so that the poor man and we pay for gas. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, let me say this and then we see how to proceed: The Minister for Finance earlier made a statement to this House that appropriation is the responsibility of this House. It is this House that appropriates and it appropriates along expenditure lines agreed upon by the House - that we want to give you this money for the following expenditure lines. 

However, it is also the responsibility of this House to approve measures of taxation to generate the revenue. We also have to approve methods of generation of revenue. So, whatever we are going to appropriate, we must have also put in place measures to generate revenue to meet that appropriation-(Interjection) - Yes, I know that you know but from the way we are debating, it is as if we do not know that.  

The reason why I am saying this is because what is proposed in this tax Bill are the revenue measures. Now, if we are deleting them without solutions to filling the gaps, what happens to what we have passed to appropriate? So, we have to be cautious about this also. 

Let us not just be a House that talks about the poor without talking about how we are going to generate money for the services for the poor. Really! We also have to generate money for services for the poor - the health infrastructure, the roads and all these things. So we need to balance these arguments. This issue of salt for the poor or goitre may not help us much. (Laughter)- Let us be realistic about these things, honourable members. The people who have proposed this have done studies and they have looked everywhere –(Interjections)- I am guiding the House, please. They have looked everywhere and they have proposed this as the solution and they are asking this House to approve and supply the expenditure.

MR EKANYA: I do agree with your concern, Mr Chairman. The Parliamentary Commission, which you chair, has a budget office and technical staff and we get documents from Government about the implication of these taxes. We do study and every time we debate here, we request for more studies. 

I have been engaging the Ministry of Finance and in the Excise Duty Tax Bill that is likely to come back, we have agreed on a new measure to generate tax revenue. If you want, with your permission, I can tell you what it is. I wanted to introduce it here but it is not applicable here because hon. Ssebagala and even the President has written three letters that in this country, we export unmilled and unprocessed maize bought by Kenya and South Sudan. In a period where we do not have maize, farmers buy animal feeds and poultry from Kenya at a very high cost. I have, therefore, agreed with the Ministry of Finance that when the Excise Duty Tax Bill comes here, we are going to introduce – (Interjections) - No, there is another one we did not conclude. We are going to introduce excise duty on export of unprocessed cereals so that it can balance.

Another measure - The other day when we were passing the other Excise Duty Bill, I proposed 0.5 per cent – (Interjections)- Kindly, I will give you the opportunity. I proposed 0.5 per cent tax on transfer of shares in the stock market and that generated debate. I have consulted the technical people and we have kind of come to a consensus and I was waiting for hon. Omach to officially communicate so that we give in. Really, we do not want to hamper Government from operation. 

May I, therefore, request hon. Omach o communicate so that we move forward because this is the only one we are willing to concede on and move forward –(Interjections)– on salt and gas because –

MR SSEBUNYA: Mr Chairman, It seems like we are now building consensus. We have a whole list in (b) where the Government has proposed to remove from the Schedule r, s, u, v, w, cc, ff, hh, ii and aa. So, can we pass the rest and then we remain with liquefied gas. That was my proposal. - (Interjections) - In the Second Schedule, r is about the supply of feeds of poultry and livestock; s is supply of machinery used for processing agricultural and dairy products –[ Mr Ekanya: “S is wrongly placed, by the way.”] - u is supply of accommodation in tourist lodges and hotels outside Kampala; v is supply of new computers, desktop printers and computer parts –

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the contention here is that we deal with the issue of salt and gas. That is the view from the shadow minister. Salt and gas - that is the debate here.  So, if we agree on salt and gas, the rest of the things will go. Why are we again enlarging this? Let us sort the issue of salt and gas and then we move on, please. 

Hon. Minister, you know in the days when we used to do drafting, they said that laws are made to pass like razors are made to sell. If it cannot pass, then you have a problem with it. It should be able to pass – razors –

MR OMACH: Mr Chairman, as far as gas is concerned, I would want to give the example of electricity. You have conceded to the 12 per cent on gas? Okay, so as far as salt is concerned, when you exempt, you discourage people who would like to bring factories here to make salt. Since we started implementing the VAT measures on salt, I have explained that the price has only gone up slightly and we have not had much concern from the people. So it has not gone up much. The demand for salt is inelastic and we have already mentioned the revenue measures that are attached to this. Mr Chairman, you have rightly explained that the budget needs to balance - the revenue and expenditure sides.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, I would like to put the question. Is it the opinion of the House that we leave gas and we only deal with the issue of salt? So, can I only put the question in relation to salt, that is, F(f)? 

MR ODONGA OTTO: Mr Chairman, the minister has been very clear and he is not presenting individual positions because I have heard him three times still saying- The arguments on salt are very nice and anyone can raise them here, but the minister who is also a politician like us still comes and says, we still need the tax on salt. So, I do not see how this issue can be resolved by voting because my understanding is that the minister seems to say his hands are tied and he cannot make concessions. He should, first of all, tell us whether he can concede or whether his instructions are very specific that he cannot concede because we cannot vote-

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Ntenjeru is the chairman of the budget committee so-

MR LUGOLOOBI: Mr Chairman, in an effort to try and make some concessions, on the list there is an item in (e), which is the supply of diapers; I want to propose that we include diapers on this list. This is because diapers are not for the poor.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: This House normally proceeds in a safe way when matters that are being discussed have been examined by the committee. When diapers were never an issue before the committee, we do not know the full implication of these diapers if we bring them out.

DR BAYIGGA: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. I have been listening to the arguments on taxation of salt and the minister’s arguments. I want to particularly seek clarification on this salt issue from members who are making pro-poor arguments. How much has salt increased since it was introduced? If at all there is any member who can give us some information that poor people are now unable to afford salt –(Ms Kabaale rose_)– Certainly not.

I want to be persuaded by members –(Interjection)– I will give you a chance. I want to be persuaded by members that these measures will increase the price of salt to such an extent that our ordinary people will not afford it. It is very unlikely that that price will not be affordable. (Interjections) I have been keeping quiet for a very long time. 

We cannot really give empirical evidence that these measures are going to increase goitre to this extent; it is very unlikely Mr Chairman. We do not want to create business for doctors who operate goitre but in any case, it cannot arise in a month. I think the minister’s suggestion is quite persuasive. Let everybody pay something for this budget. We are incensed with arguments of making people vulnerable. I am afraid that many of the Members of Parliament on my side may not be for me but I believe people need to make a contribution. Thank you very much, Mr Chairman.

MR SSEMUGABA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I stood up here to support the proposal of the minister that let us charge that little money and collect taxes so that we can provide services to the people. We will be able to afford it and we shall talk for it without fear or favour because it is in the favour of the common man.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I want to pick those who have not spoken on this subject.

MR KAFUDA: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. In levying a tax, you first look at the services you have provided in order to get a return from it. If you look at the salt industry of this country, what has the government put in? Nothing completely! Year in, year out this country is spending almost Shs 44 billion importing salt from other countries. What has happened to our industry here? They have failed to revive it and now the government comes up saying that they are going to get tax from the imported salt yet we have failed to revive ours here.

Mr Chairman, I do not support this unless the minister assures us that this time round this tax is going to revive our salt industry here.

MR OKOT OGONG: Mr Chairman, I want to inform members that there are two ways in which we raise tax. One is direct, whereby you are taxed directly. The next one is indirect tax so that everybody participates.

Mr Chairman, as you are aware, we have very many poor people but at the same time, we have so many interests of the poor people that as Parliament we need to solve. Therefore, since it is a participatory process, we are providing money for them, we are planning for them, therefore in budgeting, it is an expression of government and the community - I appeal to Members that we need to impose that VAT on salt. (MEMBERS: “No”)

I want to appeal to you; we have to be realistic. The money that we are going to get – like the people of Dokolo – the money we are going to get from that salt is going to work on our roads; it will drill boreholes for our women so that they have water to drink. The money is going to pay school fees for our children and it is going to pay teachers. By the way, you are aware that as a country, we have agreed that we are not homosexuals and the donors are harassing us. So, let us raise our own money so that we are independent.

MR SEBAGGALA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. The Government has made many concessions and indeed you have ably guided this House that as we look at the expenditure side, we must also look at how we are going to collect revenue. If the Government has agreed on the agricultural inputs, on gas – (Interjections) – on hoes, given the fact there is universal primary education in villages and other areas, I support that salt is taxed to ensure that the country develops. I suggest that we vote.

MR BARYAYANGA: Mr Chairman, I am going to painfully support the minister’s position. I am saying painfully because whereas we are thinking we are going to get money to do our work, the personalities, who are the technical people like the Ssenketos you have heard about of late, the Kazindas, will come in and take all that we are trying to look for. You cannot imagine Shs 24 billion taken at ago. This is what we are trying to look for around here right now. 

Please, we have to come out and get more superior to make sure the services of the people are catered for while we charge them these monies. The ministries relevant for doing these things should come in to make sure things are done not being stolen left right and centre. What are we going to tell our children’s children - that we were there and we kept on doing nothing? I, therefore, support the minister’s position very painfully. Thank you. 

MS EKWAU IBI: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. I implore this House to reconsider the tax on salt. When you move from Kampala and you reach Kacumbala, for example, on a market day - Members go for committee trips, Members go upcountry - you will see things completely changing. Mothers with babies on their backs and baskets at the carriers and they are selling all the cereals they have laboured so hard to produce in order to take to the market. When they reach the market, this produce is sold at giveaway prices in most cases and they are struggling to get salt. In two months’ time, the granary is empty and they have nothing more to sell. At least, honestly speaking, any additional point – 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, it is not that salt is not necessary; that is not the argument. Please, let us go beyond that argument. Everybody needs salt – I need salt, you need salt, people in the villages need salt. The question is: will the increase as a result of VAT make it impossible for people to buy? The need for salt, whether it is on the roadside or in the shops, is known. Can we address the issue of whether this increase by whatever amount - Shs 49 - will make it impossible for people in the villages to afford salt.

MS EKWAU: The people in the countryside will definitely afford salt but you are bringing in the question of food insecurity in the family. The locals are selling cereals and that is all they are producing in order to buy the salt. That is what is happening, at least in the communities that I represent. Thank you.

MS FRANCA AKELLO: Thank you, hon. Ibi, for giving me way to give you this information. This tax will prevent some very old and very poor people from buying salt. 

Two, I also want to inform you that increase in the prices of salt is very highly associated with collapse of regimes. So we would like to save the face of this government – Yes, I was a student of history and I was taught that whenever you see prices of salt going high and prices of soap – the basic needs of a home - that is highly associated with the collapse of regimes. We do not want this government to collapse because the –(Interruption)  

MR OKOT OGONG: Mr Chairman, hon. Franca is aware that the government which is currently in power has been in power for 28 years and it has not collapsed. She is also aware that government has come up with various measures and our people are happy because many developments have taken place, and this proposal is in the interest of availing resources and facilities to our voters. Is it in order, therefore, well aware that this Government has lasted for 28 years without any hint of collapse, for a Member to propose that by passing this Bill, the NRM Government will collapse? Is she in order?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: The hon. Member for Agago said in her experience, when prices of salt go up, regimes collapse. By ruling on this matter, it will mean that it a scientifically proven fact or a historically proven fact. So, I do not think it is even necessary to put it to order.

MS EKWAU: Conclusively, Mr Chairman, for the plight of the communities that sell food crops in order to buy salt, I kindly request that this House considers the issue of not adding even just a shilling onto salt because it will make salt unaffordable and communities will have to sell their food crops in order to purchase it.

MS ALUM: Thank you, Mr Chairman. It is unfortunate that the minister has gone out. Otherwise, I would plead with him particularly on this salt issue.

Mr Chairman, you know that we come from more or less the same area, and you know that the prices in Kampala are quite different from those in our villages. On that note, even if the minister says that it is just an increment from Shs 525 to Shs 549, that is still the price in Kampala. When it comes to our villages, it might even go up to Shs 700 or even Shs 1,000, Mr Chairman. To make matters worse, in my district now, the roads are very bad yet they are the ones that are used by traders to go and buy this salt. 

One time I travelled to Rwanda with the minister for benchmarking, but I can tell you that we learnt a lot on issues of gender; the issue of salt is so related to women –(Interjections)– Yes, because as one member said, he can go to buy waragi but for the rural woman, the first item on the list is usually salt. So, to put the gender perspective, I really urge the minister to apply what we learnt in Rwanda. Thank you.

MR AMURIAT: Mr Chairman, thank you. I rise to oppose the proposal by the minister to levy VAT on common salt. This is because this is a necessity as it has been said. However, I would like to inform the House that there are households that can afford salt at the present price. Borrowing salt because households cannot afford it is a very common practice in some villages of this country and this is real. So, I can imagine a situation where we impose that 18 per cent tax on a necessity like salt – what will happen to those kinds of villages? Definitely, salt will not be something to afford.

The arguments that have been advanced by some of my colleagues who support taxation on salt look like this is the only tax that the local person is expected to pay. We know that they manufacture materials that a common person uses –(Interjection) Mr Chairman, kindly put some members to order because I am being disrupted. Cloths that our people commonly use, soap, sugar, transport, airtime, which is now used by villages, all carry taxes. So, just to make us believe this is something small, that it is the only tax that the common people in the villages are paying, is actually to miss a point.

The other situation is lack of social service delivery. Actually, the local people in the villages pay for self-service – when they are told there is no medicine in the hospital, they definitely go to the nearest clinic and pay for their medical bills. This is supplementing the effort of Government and that should not be ignored. This is a direct expense that the local person in the villages incurs because we are unable to provide for them. So, what is the rationale, Mr Chairman and honourable members, for us to impose more and more taxes on these local people? We are bringing them down. We are not being sensitive. You and I can afford that salt at any price but we should not impose a tax on a person who is unable. 

I would like to bring to the attention of this House the problem that our people face in the marketing of their produce. The local persons are being cheated yet that is the only source of money to buy salt. You find a full bag of sweet potatoes twice my height being sold at Shs 15,000 yet out of that money –(Interjections)– Yes, I am telling the truth; I come from Kumi and I have the evidence. I do not want anybody – I am the biggest grower of sweet potatoes in this country and so I speak with authority. 

Anyway, when you put yourself in the position of a person who grows and sells sweet potatoes at Shs 15,000 per bag, which is harvested from one half of an acre to raise this money, it is difficult. So, I would like to implore my colleagues who speak like wealthy people and are insensitive to the plight of the local people, to really come to their senses. Mr Chairman, look at the plight of the common man down on the ground and do not see the common man through a lens of a rich person because when we do that, we will be missing a point. Mr Chairman, I thank you very much.

MR ODOI-OYWELOWO: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I think that there is absolutely nothing relevant to this debate that has not been covered. There is absolutely nothing relevant on both sides of the coin. So, I would like to only propose to add my two cents by way of a summation on the side of the people who support the introduction of VAT on salt.

Mr Chairman, what we are being called upon to provide this evening is leadership. It is only one thing, leadership. Leadership and populism are mutually exclusive. You cannot be a good leader when you seek to be a populist. A good leader is like a surgeon –(Interjections)- Mr Chairman, may I be protected? I sat here throughout this afternoon and listened to colleagues. A good leader must act like a surgeon. If a patient has a tumour and it has to be removed by way of surgery, you conduct a surgery and surgery is painful but ultimately it saves life.

Now, we have a government that has presented tax measures, well thought-out over a long period of time, over a year. Going through every figure and every tax measure, they looked at both the revenue and expenditure sides and satisfied themselves that the two were at par before coming to us. But you need to know that those fellows in Government need votes. They are sensitive because they need votes. So, they are the first set of people who cannot prejudice their stay in power. –(Interjection)– If you have recommended to us that if you introduce VAT, I will allow you my brother, you know I like you, you are from Tororo. 

They have indicated to us that by introducing this tax measure, they will collect Shs 8 billion. This is substantial in a financial year; we can use that money to render services to our people. So for every tax measure that we shoot down, we must ask ourselves what programme we want to cut down because we cannot get out one and leave out the other. If we do not want them to collect Shs 8 billion, what function then don’t you want them to perform in this financial year? Hon. Ekanya, I will give you an opportunity to make a contribution with permission of the chair.

You know what we are doing is something like sending a boxer to a ring without gloves and you tie one leg but still expect him to win anyway. That is unreasonable and immoral and you do not want to walk that path. We have said this afternoon that the only way you can have the programmes reach your people. (Interruption)

MR AMURIAT: Mr Chairman, I think we have constituted ourselves into a committee of the whole House for a purpose, and I think that tells of the very existence of Parliament. If Government brought proposals and there were no arguments for and against them, then we could as well allow the Government to just lay the proposals on the Table and then we adopt them. The purpose of Parliament in appropriation is to stimulate thinking on the part of Government while looking at the people of Uganda and also in a way sympathising with the situation that the Government is under. 

The procedural point I would like to raise is whether this debate is of any value, judging from what my brother, Fox Odoi, is saying. I do not know whether his opinion is something that should be taken because it looks like he is disregarding the views of others who are dissenting from what he is trying to say. Would it be procedurally right for us to continue to allow hon. Odoi to disrespect divergent views and think as a House we should just be “yes” people? I am sure that that is not the reason we are here, Mr Chairman.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I am not able to produce the copy of the Hansard now but my recollection is that you made strong submissions just seconds ago and the whole House entertained you and listened to you politely and quietly. Is it too much to ask to listen to other people’s views?

MR ODOI-OYWELOWO: Thank you very much, hon. Chair, for that wise ruling. I was at the tail end of my submission. The minister has made another strong argument that from a 5kg bag of salt, if you introduce 18 VAT the price will only increase by Shs 29. Even members that are opposed to the introduction of this tax at least concede that that is fact in respect to Kampala. Now Shs 29 increment, if you divide by five to get the increment per kilogram, you get the equivalent of about Shs 5. An increment of Shs 5 per kilogram is certainly affordable by every Ugandan - by the Ugandans that I represent, by the Ugandans that we all represent. So the opportunity cost –(Interruption)

MR AKENA: It is with reluctance that I rise on a point of order, but the honourable member holding the Floor is misleading the House. The minister was talking about the 500 grams sachet of salt increasing from Shs 520 to Shs 549. Information, which I have directly from my constituency is that 500 grams has increased by exactly Shs 100. Therefore, is the honourable member in order to distort the figures when we are dealing with an important matter affecting the common man. Is he in order? 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I have not received any message from my constituency about the price of salt and the information you have received has not been relayed to the hon. Fox Odoi from West Budama North. However, the point is that the figures being talked about are a bit different and you can forgive the member for being a lawyer and not a very good mathematician, but the figure the minister referred to is different from the figure you are referring to. So we can as well just say what the minister has said, the difference was this instead of inserting new figures and measurements. 

MR ODOI-OYWELOWO: I thank you, Mr Chairman, for your wise ruling and I apologise.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: I would prefer if you would wind up.

MR ODOI-OYWELOWO: Rt Hon. Chair, I am winding up with a passionate plea to my brother from Tororo. Hon. Ekanya and I represent pretty much the same people. I know the economic status of the people of Tororo like he knows the economic status of the people of West Budama. You know for a fact that this tax will not hurt them but the lack of the Shs 8 billion will certainly hurt the Ugandan economy. Kindly withdraw your amendment.

MR DOMBO: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. A while ago you asked a fundamental question while guiding this House. We have a responsibility to look at the expenditure but we must mobilise the resources. What is required of us here, like my colleague said, is that we must provide leadership. 

Over the number of years I have been in Parliament, whenever a tax has been introduced during the budgetary period and it is reviewed midway, you only do it at the advantage of traders not the people who are paying the final price in the market. We have done this before. The other day we shot down the price on paraffin; I want to tell you that the pump price of paraffin will not go down by that margin. It is going to be there to the advantage of the pump sellers. In most cases when we do this, people must realise –(Interruption) 

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: I did not want to raise this point of order, but I want to tell the members here that the margin every person with a petrol station gets is between Shs 60 and Shs 80 –

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Per litre.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: Yes, per litre. This means now that if they reduce the tax by Shs 200, the supplier will supply knowing that your margin is Shs 60 to Shs 80. Is my colleague, who has never dealt with the pump –(Laughter) – in order to say that the pump owners are going to be the ones to get the Shs 200 and yet their margin is determined by suppliers like Total and Shell? Is he in order? 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: So where does the Shs200 go?

MR EKANYA: Government takes it.

MR NANDALA-MAFABI: The Shs 200 will come in like this: the cost at the pump will be x amount of money, when it reaches the border –(Interjections)– okay, let us say that at the border, the cost of a litre of paraffin is US$ 1 which is Shs 2,600. When it comes, URA will say that every litre is Shs 200 and it may come to Shs 2,800. Now the company adds its margin and tells the pump person that the price is Shs 2,850 and plus your Shs 60, it is now Shs 2,910. Are you getting it? But if you remove it, the cost automatically - I want you to test that - will go down immediately by the Shs 200 because it is the cost at the pipeline plus the cost of the person to the depots.

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, I think that we all know, and I said this before, that there have been instances where we have reduced taxes and prices have gone up. That has happened. So, that is a very perfect calculation for the man sitting on the desk and doing calculations but for the final person paying the prices, there may be very slight variations.

MR DOMBO: We did the same to VAT on water and removed the tax but the price was never affected. We always do this to the advantage of the traders but not the final consumer we had decided to protect.

I have listened to the arguments of Members of Parliament here but unfortunately, they have diverted the debate. As leaders, we must help the people in our constituencies to have priorities right. People who are failing to pay for salt can afford alcohol; people who are failing to pay for salt are spending their money on other activities like smoking cigarettes. Those are areas where we must help the country to have priorities right – [MS AOL: “Those are men.”] We cannot –(Interjection). I will yield and take the information, but let me finish my submission first. 

I, therefore, want to appeal to my colleagues – Recently, I was in my constituency and the people asked me when we are re-tabling the anti-homosexual Bill and I did tell them about the consequences of the decision that we had taken. The people of Bunyole told me that they are prepared to pay higher but they cannot afford to forsake their own rights and values because we must get money from the donors. (Applause) This is what we must tell our people, that if salt must go up by Shs100 we would rather do so other than begging the homosexuals in order to have –(Interruption)

MR MAGYEZI: Thank you very much. I would like to oppose the proposal of the minister to put tax on salt. (Applause) I do appreciate, and it is not a shame but it is my right to present my views. (Applause)

I appreciate the fact that we need revenue to finance our budget and there is no doubt about that. I know that the Shs 8 billion could assist towards the budget for roads, boreholes, construction of schools and all that. However, we cannot afford to construct roads and boreholes at the expense of the basics of our people. (Applause) There is no doubt that the basics are food before you go to anything else, and with food, you are talking about salt. Yes, honourable colleagues, a surgeon must take the knife and do the needful but for goodness sake, surgery respects the basics, and that is life. (Applause) If you are a surgeon and you choke the person, you do not even put the person on – [MR EKANYA: “Anaesthesia”] - then you are not a surgeon. 

For me, surely, there are other things we have talked about exempting, some things far less valued than salt in a home. I think that if we are going to put this to the vote, it should be by name and I would like to stand and say, “no tax on salt”. (Applause) It is not palatable –(Interruption)- Yes, information from my colleague.

MS KAABALE: Thank you, hon. Magyezi. I would like to give this information to the House and enrich hon. Magyezi’s contribution. When you are budgeting, even in a home, you sometimes forego some things and you put some as priority. So the information that I am giving is that in this case when we are budgeting and looking for funds, there must be alternative sources in case the other funding for salt is not coming. 

Hon. Minister, there is anticipation in the papers that we should exempt tourism. I would rather, since this tourism money is going to be shared between three countries, that we look for alternative areas and we do not subject people to danger. That is the information. (Applause)

MR MAGYEZI: Thank you, colleague, as that is very valuable information. Surely, you exempt a person going to a lodge and then you put tax on salt! I have heard some people arguing that on a packet of salt, an increase of Shs 30 is nothing. Mr Chairperson, this is not acceptable. 

At the time this Government was removing graduated tax, there was a reduction from Shs 10,000 to Shs 6,000 and we even went as low as Shs 1,000 and the argument was that people cannot afford even this Shs 1,000 for a whole year. Shs 1,000 for a whole year is Shs 90 per month which is just about Shs 30 a day for a working class person. If we argued that time that this was not possible for our people, how can we now say that on the basics of food - salt – Shs 30 on a sachet, which is just a quarter of a kilogramme, is nothing? I think we should be serious and let us go for other things. Let us look for money but leave food and clothing alone for the ordinary people.

MRS CECILIA OGWAL: You are a man indeed.

MR OKOT: Thank you, Mr Chairperson. I was very quiet, observing how the debate was going on and I think this is the moment where I have to say a word about salt. In Agago, and in some places like deep in Gulu, people are as if they are living in the old age times and the reason is that people cannot afford salt. The moment you visit and talk with them, men will ask you for waragi but women will ask you for salt. (Applause) This is a clear sign that many people who normally get votes through distribution of salt will benefit a lot as well. I stand to say that let us leave salt out, we should not tax salt.

Mr Chairman, normally when we are travelling upcountry, we like stopping midway in Nakasongola area. I once noticed a very sad occurrence where a boy was selling roasted meat and he had salt in his hands. One of his colleagues knocked him and the salt was thrown down. An old woman came to grab that salt from the soil. That indicates that salt is a paramount item to the people. Besides, for somebody to go and pick salt from the ground means that, that person cannot afford the salt. So if we levy a tax on salt, we are denying that very person who we are saying we want to bring services to. 

Mr Chairman, we are saying 500 grams of salt costs about Shs 520 but when you go to a rural place like in Agago, it costs Shs 1200. This is the proposal in this tax and that means the moment we put 18 per cent on this, the price is going to shoot up more than what we think. Therefore, the very person who is on the ground is going to have a problem. 

We are representing people and we are not saying that we do not offer leadership. However, we must differentiate between the two: offering leadership and representing the people. These are people who will not come here to speak on their own. We have to say that the more we increase taxation on salt, by the time -Hon. Otto mentioned that people are drinking a lot of waragi in sachets and we know that; those are the areas we can tax. When we talk about cigarettes, many people are smoking and we are leaving them like that. These are the areas we can tax so that we can offer alternative areas.

So, Mr Chairman, let us leave salt alone; we should not disturb these people. We will not say we are tying the legs of the government; no. On the other hand, those who are supporting homosexuality are using it as a tool to campaign as well and we understand that, but let us forget about that at the moment. Look at that poor person down on the ground. Mr Chairman, I thank you so much.

There is another point I wanted to mention, that much as others are conceding on gas, when you travel you will see that some people have already labelled their lorries, “carrying forests to the city”. These are lorries that carry charcoal. That tells us that as leaders, we should begin thinking about what other alternative views we can incorporate to encourage our people towards alternative sources of fuel. 

Instead of sensitising people on using gas for cooking and other things, we are putting a lot of tax on it. People are going to run to charcoal and in the end, we are going to destroy this environment of ours. I think this will affect us in a year to come and we must not take it lightly. Hon. Otto, give the information.

MR ODONGA OTTO: The information I want to give is that the statistics we have just got are that only 18 per cent of Ugandans live below the poverty line. This means that concerning the issue of affordability of salt, most likely only 18 per cent of the population may not be able to afford that salt.

MS BAKO: Mr Chairman, not so long ago we talked about the health insurance exemption and we realised that the segment was so small, even below 10 per cent. However, we went ahead and said that it is making us exempt this. Hon. Otto, with his unsubstantiated statistics, is indicating that 18 per cent of the population is living below the poverty line. That translates, in simple terms, to about 3.8 million people. Is the honourable member therefore in order to suggest that what affects 3.8 million Ugandans can be ignored against about 500,000 Ugandans? Is he in order?

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: No, I think the two circumstances are not comparable. The other circumstance is related to those who can afford and you cannot use the percentage of those who can afford, even if they are only one per cent, and compare them to those who cannot afford. I think they are diagrammatically opposed to each other.

MR AMOS OKOT: Thank you very much. Regarding the information about the 18 per cent, I think let us be-

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Please, honourable member, wind up. 

MR AMOS OKOT: Okay. Let us be natural and local at the same time. I want to use the word local. Look at the people that you are representing. You will not believe that the 18 per cent are above and close to 60 per cent. So I do not want to take that kind of information as something that can enrich my argument.

MS ANN MARIA NANKABIRWA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. What I understand by a budget function as a mandate of Parliament is to look at expenditure and revenue. While Parliament is budgeting to provide for funds for the services we must deliver to our people, we must also provide for revenue. One of our colleagues mentioned that our purpose is to provide leadership. We cannot provide leadership if we prove to be opportunists. 

I cannot stand here – the people I represent are agriculturalists - Kyankwanzi is a rural district – and they grow cereals like maize and groundnuts, but I cannot understand the –(Interjections)– The people I represent in Kyankwanzi depend on agriculture, but I have seen them selling a kilogramme of groundnuts at Shs 3,500. It beats my understanding why this person who expects services from Government cannot sell a single kilogramme of ground nuts and only get Shs 500, even if it is Shs 600, to buy a kilogramme of salt which they are going to use every day. 

One of the principles of taxation is – it is a turnover; how many people take salt? When you charge the salt, it means you are charging depending on the level of consumption. It means those who can afford three meals in a day will be paying more. Those who can afford a single meal in a day can be charged less. Taxation is one way of changing our lifestyles too. We are defining our people as poor; can you show me those people we are saying are poor and cannot afford their basic needs? We have just concluded the census but can I be told which poor family has been limited to practice acts which increase the population? But the population this person is aiding to increase expects services from the government.

How are we going to fund that? We have exempted our people from paying fees through UPE and USE –(Interruption)

MR KAFUDA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. We do not levy taxes for only service delivery but we look also at the implication it may have on the population. Our argument was on the negativity of imposing tax on salt. Is the honourable member in order to call us opportunists? 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: An opportunist is a person who sees an opportunity and seizes it. 

MS ANN MARIA NANKABIRWA: Thank you, Mr Chairman. If Uganda is to improve on its dependency - This Parliament is still defending the anti-homosexuality Bill; as the population is still demanding that we re-table the Bill and pass it, we must always be careful and make sure that we are on the path to independence. How much is the population contributing to the wellbeing of society? 

The leadership must provide for the people irrespective of how many votes we are going to get tomorrow. We must be able to guide our population. We must be able to provide leadership. We must be able to inform our population that Government has exhausted taxation on cereals, paraffin and in so doing because the same Government wants to render services to you, and by providing the incentives to the agricultural inputs, therefore you are reaping more profits. Government would want to collect more tax to help you to add value to whatever you are producing. Would it be too much to ask if even you contributed to yourself by selling a kilogramme of groundnuts at Shs 3,500 and you get Shs 500 and buy the salt yourself? I want to end by saying we should collectively support the minister to raise money to fund the budget. 

THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, it is 8.00 p.m. and I have sat here from 2.00 p.m. Many of you have been in and out and I have not.
