COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you. As you may appreciate, we are just half way of dealing with the Constitution (Amendment) Bills. We have Bill No. 2 and No. 3 therefore, you should continue to be diligent in attending to the Business of the House. Do not relax. As regards the issue of climatic changes, that is the weather, I have made consultation with the satellite and I want to assure you that very soon, we will no longer have dry weather but a rainy season. 

There were some technical problems but they have now been solved and hon. Kabushenga wishes to inform and invite all members of Parliament to the second Annual General Meeting of the Parliamentarian Cooperative, Savings and Credit Society due to take place on Friday, 15th July at 2.00 p.m. in the Members Lounge. Thereafter, there will be dinner and entertainment in the Parliamentary Gardens, starting at 7.00 p.m. You are all welcome.

MR AGGREY AWORI (Samia-Bugwe County North, Busia): Thank you, Mr Speaker. Yesterday was a historic day in our proceedings and while I consider live coverage of the proceedings of Parliament a privilege, I thought yesterday was one of the most important. However, I noted with great concern from my electorate that Radio Uganda did not cover our proceedings live. People in my constituency are wondering whether it was a technical problem or a deliberate action to keep them from following what was happening. Some of them even alleged that maybe I had not voted correctly because they did not know how I responded to the key question when you put it. I am wondering whether the Rt. Honourable Prime Minister or the senior member of the Government can tell us what happened yesterday and why Parliament was not covered live by Radio Uganda.

THE SPEAKER: To be honest, I do not know whether any minister can stand up immediately and respond. Maybe they will let us know what happened tomorrow.

ADMINISTRATION OF OATHS

The Oaths were administered to:

Mr Joseph Mutebi Balikudembe.

THE SPEAKER: Hon. Balikudembe, you are warmly welcome to the Seventh Parliament of Uganda -(Applause)- at which your beloved father, the late Patrick Musisi, served diligently until 11th May when God took him to a permanent home. We greatly miss him. You are not new to your constituency of Busiro South since you were born there. Your constituents, without classifying them on any basis, have expressed their confidence in you. You are supposed to serve them to the best of your ability.

I understand there are 50,000 registered voters in your constituency. Some voted for you, some did not and others are not eligible voters because they are underage. You are supposed to serve them without discrimination. (Applause) The divisions you might have faced during the campaigns should now cease. You are a leader of a constituency and you cannot afford to follow up these differences, otherwise you will fail to serve.  

As a member of Parliament, in the first place, you will have to articulate local issues. However, this House is not only for local issues otherwise we would be divided into 214 constituencies. We come here to deliberate on national and international issues without forgetting local issues. I expect you to measure up to those expectations. It is true you may experience differences of opinion with your colleagues but these differences should not turn those against your views to become your enemies. Relate to them amicably and I have no doubt you will succeed.

You have been taken to the seat where your late beloved father used to sit. Please do exactly what your late beloved father did, relate to your colleagues and act as a nationalist. I wish you the best. (Applause)

MS NUSURA TIPERU (Woman Representative, Yumbe): Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I want to take this opportunity to remind my colleagues and Government that a few weeks ago, my colleague, hon. Omach, talked about cholera in his area. As we speak, the situation of cholera in Yumbe and Arua is alarming. Two days ago, I was in my constituency and I attended many burials and most of the cases were as a result of cholera. As you know, the people of Yumbe share facilities with the people of Arua. The worst hit areas are Arua Municipality in particular Oli division, Rhino camp, Ribo and Awindiri, which is occupied by many people from Nebbi. In these areas the situation is very bad.

I thank Government, because they are doing their best to curb the situation. However, I stand here to raise a concern. First and foremost, Yumbe my district is complaining that only 69 million of the money that was appropriated to them for primary health care was released.  They requested me to urge Government to release the balance of their money because according to the Budget, Government was expected to release 230 million last financial year but only 69 million was released. Government, please help my district so that they can curb this situation.

Secondly, there is currently a conflict between politicians and health personnel in Yumbe. The health personnel are telling people to close down markets and are sensitizing people about sanitation especially those in areas of high population while on the other hand, some politicians are doing the contrary. So -(Interruption)

MS AKELLO: Thank you, Mr Speaker and honourable colleagues. I can’t help what God gave me. I thank the honourable colleague for giving way in the middle of her address but I wanted to ask her whether she has compared notes with the Ministers of Health, Disaster Preparedness and also with me because this is the first time I am hearing this issue from her.

MS TIPERU: Thank you very much, my mother, Grace Akello, for your clarification. Actually, I am raising this issue because much as I have tried to compare notes with the minister, the people requested me to seek the indulgence of Government. Since Prof. Nsibambi is here, with effect from tomorrow you could dispatch a team of health personnel from the ministry. This is because there is a serious crisis as far as the leadership and medical personnel are concerned.  

The medical personnel are telling people that they want markets closed while the politicians is saying, “Why do you want to close our markets when this is where people are carrying out trade and cooking food?” This situation needs to be sorted out and we need a strong message from Government to harmonize the position of the politicians who may be seeking votes and undermining the level at which this disease is spreading. I seek Government’s indulgence in this matter that having a serious meeting with the politicians and technocrats is a matter of urgency that is required by the people of West Nile.  

The women I represent in this House are highly affected because most of them are in the business of cooking food. Their businesses, as of now, have been closed and people are even scared of going into Arua. As you know, Arua is a border point and it is almost the headquarters of West Nile. People from Yumbe usually go to trade in Arua so business is affected and children are not going to school because school fees is very difficult to get now.

In spite of all this, the population is doing its best to sensitize people because the presence of cholera in an area is an indication that people are eating feaces, which is very embarrassing. We are worried and are asking Government to come and support the local people because many of them lost their children, while in exile in Sudan, to cholera.  Therefore for us to continue dying of cholera, even now, is really serious -(Interruption)


MR AWORI:  Information.

MS TIPERU: I accept that information.

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, this was not intended to be a debate. It was intended for a report on the state of emergency in the area to be made so that Government can take action. It seems now members are preparing to turn this into a debate but that is not going to happen. Just finish your report so that we can see what –(Interruption)- if you have finished -(Interruption)

MS TIPERU: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker and I hope that Government has got the message. I hope that tomorrow you will come to Arua, Yumbe and other districts so that the situation is reduced. To add to that –(Interjections)- Thank you very much.

3.00
THE MINISTER OF STATE, DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND REFUGEES (Mrs Christine Amongin Aporu): Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable member, Nusura Tiperu from Yumbe district, for raising the issue of cholera outbreak in Yumbe district. Government, through the National Disaster Committee, will handle the situation and get back to the House accordingly. Thank you very much.

MR LUKYAMUZI: Procedure, Mr Speaker.

THE SPEAKER:  No, no, no.

MR LUKYAMUZI:  Procedure, Mr Speaker.

THE SPEAKER:  No, no, no please.

Abstention:

1. Nabwiso Bulima Wilberforce 

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, thank you very much. Honourable members, the position is as follows: Abstention – one; Against – None; For – 167. The Ayes have it. (Applause). 

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 38 agreed to.

Clause 39

MR MUTULUUZA: Thank you Mr Chairman. I wanted to amend this Article by saying that “a given number of Members of Parliament should approve the appointment of the Prime Minister”; it should be at least half of all Members of Parliament. I beg to move

THE CHAIRMAN: Is that position in the text?

MR MUTULUUZA: Just justification.

THE CHAIRMAN: What is the position now in the Bill? 

MR MUTULUUZA: We are on clause 39.

THE CHAIRMAN: Yes, what is the position?

MR MUTULUUZA: Instead of simple majority, Mr Chairman-

THE CHAIRMAN: Instead of simple majority you want to have –(Interruption)

MR MUTULUUZA:  Half of all Members of Parliament.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay.

MR MUTULUUZA: My justification, Mr Chairman, is that this office is very important and therefore for it to be recognized and to carry weight at least half of all Members of Parliament should approve the appointment of the Prime Minister. I beg to move.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay.  Well, honourable members, the position is that, in clause 39(1), honourable Mutuluuza is proposing that instead of a simple majority, it should be half of the Members of Parliament. Should I put the question now? Put up your hands, because there has been reluctance -(Mr Mwesige rose_)- do you want to contribute?


THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS (Mr Adolf Mwesige):  Mr Chairman, the approval of His Excellency the Vice President under Article 108 (ii) requires simple majority and I do not know the reason yet why my Colleague wants to subject the approval of the Prime Minister to a higher standard. But the Office of the Vice President is weightier and more involving; the standard is simple majority.  

So, going by this, Sir, I would advise my colleague that we follow the same principle and require the Prime Minister’s approval to be by simple majority. 

THE CHAIRMAN:  I put the question.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands.)
 
THE CHAIRMAN:  The positions are as follows: Aye - 3; Nays - 114. The Nays have it.

(Question negatived.)

MR KABAREEBE:  Mr Speaker, within the same Clause, I wanted to move that we cater for the Office of the Prime Minister.

THE CHAIRMAN:  That is a different amendment. I put the question that Clause 39 do stand part of the Bill.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, as I have always said, you should crosscheck the Clauses with your Constitution in order to understand.  Otherwise, members will abstain when they should not have, or say “No” when they should have said “Aye”. 

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, on Clause 39, the position is as follows: Abstention – 0, No – 0, Aye – 162

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 40

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, Clause 40 is supposed to have the new formulation of what a Constitution of a Cabinet is and the Committee recommended that “Attorney General” should be inserted after “Prime Minister”. 

THE CHAIRMAN: That is the proposed amendment, I put the question that the proposed amendment –(Interruption)

THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS/ATTORNEY GENERAL (Dr Khiddu Makubuya): Mr Chairman, I am sorry but the Government does not accept this recommendation. Our view is that since Article 119 already makes it is clear that the Attorney General is a Cabinet Minister. Article 119(1) reads; “There shall be an Attorney General who shall be a Cabinet Minister appointed by the President with the approval of Parliament.”  Therefore, we do not see what this amendment adds to what is already in place.  

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, just as hon. Awori said, to avoid doubt, Article 111 lists the Constitution of Cabinet. Otherwise, all these references have been made elsewhere, creating the office of Vice President and so on and so forth, but they are listed there.  We thought it would be in the interest of the Attorney General to be added to that list, but since he is shy about it, we withdraw it.

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question on Clause 40 –(Interruption)

MR LUKYAMUZI: Mr Chairman, I would like to seek clarification before I move an amendment on Clause 40. I am afraid that the last bit of Clause 40(1) namely “As may appear reasonably necessary for the efficient running of the State” will not tempt the President to go beyond the dictates of Article 113(2).  It appears to me that we are leaving an open check for the President to expand Cabinet at his will, even when he knows of the contents of 113(2).  There is need to be specific because if he wanted to expand, he would have to come back to Parliament. I would like this clarification from the Attorney General before I move an amendment.

THE CHAIRMAN: Your view is that this proposed amendment is negating the provisions of 113 without saying so?

MR LUKYAMUZI: That is right. It is making the President unnecessarily excited.

THE CHAIRMAN: Have they repealed 113?

MR LUKYAMUZI: I want to amend 40(1) after the Attorney General has responded to my concerns.

MRS HOPE MWESIGYE:  Thank you, hon. Lukyamuzi for giving way.  The clarification I would like from you is, when you read Clause 40 and Article 111, Clause 40 is only introducing the word ‘Prime Minister’. The rest of Article 111 says the same. Therefore, since it has co-existed with Article 113(2), I do not think there is a contradiction.  I would like that clarification.  

THE SPEAKER:  No, you should explain. It is not a question of clarification, because there is no difference between what he said and what you have just said. I put the question.

MR LUKYAMUZI:  Mr Chairman - (Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN:  I think it is clear. 

MR LUKYAMUZI:  Let me move an amendment.

THE CHAIRMAN:  But which amendment, did you bring –(Interruption)

MR LUKYAMUZI:  I am moving an amendment to propose that we delete the last bit of the Clause. There shall be a Cabinet, which shall consist of the President, the Vice President, the Prime Minister and other ministers. I am saying so because in the presence of Article 113(2) there is no need of putting specific details in the Constitution.  There is no reason we should excite the President by saying  “as may appear reasonably necessary for the efficient running of the state” when we have the contents of 113(2).

THE CHAIRMAN: Hon. Lukyamuzi, Article 113 puts a sealing to 21. But the President could want to reasonably conduct his business with 15 more. Articles 111 and 113 have always been. The word ‘reasonably’ means that the Constitution may give him 21 when he needs 12. He cannot go beyond 21 unless the provisions under 113 have been invoked. Let us vote.

MR LUKYAMUZI:  You have addressed my concern.

THE CHAIRMAN:  So, I put the question that clause 40 do stand part of the Bill. 

(Question put.)

MR AACHILLA: Mr Chairman, it is not yet clear to me.  First, there was a position –(Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN:  What is not clear?

MR AACHILLA:  Mr Chairman, the chairman of the Committee had withdrawn the amendment; are we voting on the withdrawal?

THE CHAIRMAN: No, since he has withdrawn the amendment, there is no amendment. Therefore, we are voting on the proposal as it is in the Bill.

THE CHAIRMAN: The result of Clause 40 is: Abstention – 0; No – 0; Ayes – 149. the Ayes have it. Thank you very much.

(Question agreed to.)

Clause 40 agreed to.

Clause 41

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, the committee examined this clause and proposed that the amendment to provide for grounds for Parliament to refuse the approval of a Prime Minister or Minister is unnecessary. That it is not proper to limit Parliament on the grounds it can use to refuse such appointment. We propose the deletion of this clause. 

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay. 

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, the Government accepts the recommendation of the committee. (Applause)

THE CHAIRMAN: Thank you very much. I put the question that clause 41 be deleted. 

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position is: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 101. The clause is deleted. Thank you.

Clause 41 deleted.

Clause 42

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, the committee examined this clause. The principle of this amendment is acceptable but owing to the time constraint that Parliament faces, the proposed amendment is unnecessary at this time and can be handled by the next Parliament. We propose a deletion of this clause. 

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, the Government finds that clause 42 is necessary and is important. The Government considers that this clause should be included in Bill.

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question to the motion that this clause be amended.

MR LUKYAMUZI: Mr Chairman, I wanted to amend it.

THE CHAIRMAN: You can only amend it if the clause stands but if it is deleted there is nothing to amend. So I put the question to the deletion of the clause -(Interruption)

MS KIRASO: Mr Chairman, can we talk about the two positions before you put the question, or it is not necessary?

THE CHAIRMAN: Let me dispose of the first one.
  
(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position is as follows: no abstentions, those against are 49, and those for are 53. (Applause) The Ayes have it.

Clause 42, agreed to.

Clause 43

THE CHAIRMAN: I am going to take the roll call. You bear with me. I think after this we may have to adjourn, or do you still have the stamina? Okay, let us dispose of this one first.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, as they are tabulating the results, if you look at the report of the committee we have motions for deletion, although I am sensing that you are becoming restless because we have been sitting here for long. I appeal to you that we dispose of about five motions then we shall adjourn to tomorrow. These are motions for deletion. They are quicker, so we can handle them I suppose?

The position is as follows: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 146. The ayes have it so the position is created. (Applause)

Clause 43, agreed to.

Clause 44

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, the committee recommends that the proposals contained in clause 44 be deleted. It is unnecessary at this time.

DR MAKUBUYA: The Government accepts the recommendation of the committee. (Applause)

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question to the deletion of the proposals in clause 44.  

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: The results are as follows: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 104. The ayes have it. (Applause)

Clause 44, deleted.

Clause 45

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, clause 45 is on the amendment of Article 130 on the prescription by Parliament of Justices of the Supreme Court. The committee considered that the provision does not maintain the minimum number originally put in the Constitution. Accordingly the formulation in the Constitution is better and should be retained. So we propose the deletion of clause 45.

THE CHAIRMAN: Attorney-General, that is the position.

DR MAKUBUYA: Sir, the Government accepts the recommendation of the committee on clause 45. (Applause)

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: The position on clause 45 is as follows: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 120. The ayes have it. It is deleted.

Clause 45 deleted.

Clause 46

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, clause 46 proposes the amendment of Article 134 and the reasons are the same as advanced above that it removes the minimum that was provided in the Constitution. The original formulation is better. We propose a deletion.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay. Attorney-General, is that the position?

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, the Government accepts the recommendation of the committee on clause 46.

THE CHAIRMAN: I now put the question to it. 

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: The position on clause 46 is that the abstentions are nil, none against, and those for are 114. The ayes have it. (Applause)

Clause 46 deleted.

Clause 47

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, clause 47 proposes to amend Article 138 in relation to Judges of the High Court. The same justification applies, and the original formulation in the Constitution is better. We propose a deletion.  

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, the Government accepts that clause 47 be deleted from the Bill.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay. I put the question to the deletion of clause 47.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position is as follows: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 112. The ayes have it.

Clause 47 deleted.

MR SEBAGGALA: Mr Chairman, I would like to know whether there is any harm if we delete all those clauses that need to be deleted, at once.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, for the time being we have not amended our rules on dealing with the Committee Stage. We have to singularly handle these clauses, but it is a good suggestion, which we can consider in future.

Clause 48

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, clause 48 proposes to amend Article 143 to reduce the qualification for appointment as a Court High Judge. The committee recommends deletion of this clause. The justification is that there is no compelling reason to justify the changes proposed by the Government to lower the justification for appointment to court.

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, the Government accepts that clause 48 be deleted.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position is as follows: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 116. The Ayes have it. (Applause)

Clause 48 deleted.

Clause 49

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, the committee proposes the deletion of clause 49. The justification is that the Judiciary has just embarked on the review exercise that could lead to more comprehensive proposals for amendment of the Constitution in future. The committee recommends that the proposed amendment can be handled in future, and proposes a deletion.

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, I have instructions that I accept the recommendation of the committee. (Applause)

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, I put the question to it.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position on the motion to delete clause 49 is as follows: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 125. The ayes have it.

Clause 49 deleted.

Clause 50

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, clause 50 proposes the replacement of Article 146 on the Judicial Service Commission. The reasons are the same that the Judiciary has just embarked on a review process. We propose the deletion of this clause.

DR MAKUBUYA: The Government agrees with the committee that this clause be deleted.

THE CHAIRMAN: Okay, honourable members, I put the question.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the results of the voting on the motion to delete clause 50 are as follows: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 131. The ayes have it.

Clause 50 deleted.

Clause 51

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, the committee welcomes the proposal by the Government for the appointment of court clerks and interpreters but the committee thinks it is piecemeal, it needs a bigger review to answer the Judiciary’s request for complete de-linking from the Public Service. This cannot now, therefore, be handled at this stage. Since they are doing a review, we propose a deletion of this clause.

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, I would have had a different view on clause 51 but my instructions are to accept the recommendation of the committee that the clause be deleted.  

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, I put the question.

(Question put.)

(The Members voted by a show of hands_)

MR ANANG-ODUR: Mr Chairman, I seek guidance as they are tallying the results. I am happy the Minister of Health is here. Some of us are so strained and I wonder whether we could get some services of a physiotherapist to keep us more active as we put up our hands? (Laughter)

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the position on clause 51 for which the committee has proposed to delete is as follows: no abstentions, none against, and those for are 125. The ayes have it.

Clause 51 deleted.

MR NSUBUGA NSAMBU: Mr Chairman, while I have seen that the clerks will be appointed by the commission –(Interruption) 

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable member, we have deleted the clause.

MR NSUBUGA NSAMBU: Yes, I admit but one thing I have always been worried about are the court brokers. What position do they enjoy in the Constitution? A lot of money has been lost through the court brokers and we thought this time the Government would –(Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN: What I can say –(Interruption)

MR NSUBUGA NSAMBU: At least I would have preferred a minister or somebody else to inform me.

THE CHAIRMAN: Hon. Nsubuga Nsambu, the issue you are raising is not a constitutional matter. There are laws or Acts of dealing with that particular issue and the misconduct of these people can be handled because there are systems within the law of dealing with that issue so that we do not bring it here as a constitutional matter. Honourable members, I requested you for time to deal with about five motions. Is this the convenient time to adjourn?

Clause 52

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, clause 52 proposes to amend Article 155 by deletion of clauses (2) and (3). The committee recommends that Article 155(2) and (3) should not be deleted. It is better to have the provision there even if it cannot be realistically observed it gives Parliament and the self-accounting bodies the opportunity to assess the reasons in the President’s recommendation. We propose the deletion of this clause.

DR MAKUBUYA: Mr Chairman, Article 155(2) reads as follows; “The head of any self-accounting department, commission or organisation set up under this Constitution shall cause to be submitted to the President at least two months before the end of each financial year, estimates of administrative and development expenditure and estimates of revenues of the respective department, commission or organisation for the following year.”

Article 155(3) states, “The estimates prepared under clause (2) of this Article shall be laid before Parliament by the President under clause (1) of this Article without revision but with any recommendations that the Government may have on them.” 

It is the view of the Government that Article 155(2) and (3) be repealed and government finds it necessary to have those two provisions repealed in order to harmonize the budgeting process and to make self-accounting bodies subject to the ceilings of the expenditure, given the fact that the resources are available to the Government are not infinite, hence the need for harmonization of the budgeting process. And government considers that it would be somewhat unrealistic to leave them there even if you cannot enforce them. For purposes of a better budgeting process, government proposes that clauses (2) and (3) of Article 155 be repealed.

THE CHAIRMAN: Honourable members, the motion we have is by the committee, which has moved that we delete the proposed formulation in the Bill. If we dispose of that then the other does not arise. As has been the practice, if you want to speak against the motion, please do. 

MR AMAMA MBABAZI: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I rise to speak against the proposition by the committee that clause 52 be deleted. I and many other members in this August House were in the Constituent Assembly, which promulgated this Constitution –(Interruption)

THE CHAIRMAN: No, he has the Floor let him put his case against the motion.

MR MBABAZI: Mr Chairman, I remember this Article very well and I remember that we passed clauses (2) and (3) but what it turned out to be is not what we intended. What we intended in clauses (2) and (3) of Article 155 was that when people – you see the idea of budgeting - budgeting is planning. 

Budgeting means that you are planning to perform certain activities in the given years. Each department, which is given a task to perform certain functions, comes up with estimates of what it takes to perform those functions, hence the idea of estimates that if you want me to defend Uganda successfully in one year you will require so much. The idea was that the people of Uganda through Parliament should know what it will cost them to do certain things so that when eventually money is allocated and you get half of what you thought was necessary to perform the task, then the country should expect you to perform half the task. That was the idea.  

The idea was not to force the Government, or the President for that matter, or the Chief Executive, to come up with estimates, which are not in accordance with the estimates government expects to raise in terms of revenue. This amendment being proposed, therefore, is meant to cure that problem. The idea was that you can present your estimates but actually government should come here as we have always done, the Executive should come here and say, “Our estimated revenue will be this and we propose to allocate it like this”. Precisely that is what we wanted and this is what this amendment is supposed to achieve. I, therefore, urge you members to very strongly support this.  

THE CHAIRMAN: I put the question to the motion for deletion.

MR OULANYAH: Mr Chairman, clause 54 proposes to create a reporting structure under Article 162 for the Bank of Uganda. The committee recommends that this amendment is unnecessary at this time and the clause should be deleted.
