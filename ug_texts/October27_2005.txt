COMMUNICATION FROM THE CHAIR

THE SPEAKER: Honourable members, I welcome you. I appreciate that yesterday you worked very hard and you completed two Bills, but I think that should not be the reason why you should not be here on time. I want to thank those who have been able to come and I wonder why others are not here, save the Rules Committee, which is in Jinja that I understand, but I do not know why the others are not here. 

In view of the situation as it is - I thank you, honourable minister, you are keeping the Front Bench – but in view of the position and in view of the business, which was listed for today, we were supposed to deal with The Local Government (Amendment) Bill, and I do not see the chairperson of the committee and the minister here, I have no alternative really but to adjourn the House until Monday afternoon, at 2.00 p.m.

(The House rose at 10.28 a.m. and adjourned until Monday, 31 October 2005 at 2.00 p.m.)
