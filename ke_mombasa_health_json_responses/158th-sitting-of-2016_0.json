    "health_service_delivery_improvement_recommendations": "The County government should consider employing additional firemen to enhance the staffing levels of fire stations in the County. There is a need to establish a County diving and rescue unit and manned with qualified personnel so as to handle any emerging rescue missions in the County and beyond. The firemen should be facilitated to undertake regular training and refresher courses in their specialist areas so as to be responsive to the County disaster needs. The Committee recommends the County to enter into Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) with several stakeholders such as Mombasa Water Company, Kenya Pipeline, Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and Kenya Refinery with a view to access water hydrants within the industrial areas. That during procurement of fire fighting and rescue equipment, officers from this unit be incorporated in the process/inspection so that the County can get value for money for the equipment being procured. The Committee also recommended that the Department in charge of County Fire fighting services to urgently supply the units with the three types of uniforms i.e ceremonial, protective gowns and working uniforms, safety boots, VHF communication gadgets, working gear such as breathing kits, gloves, soap, gas etc. No officer should be victimized or reprimanded for the engagement with Members of the Disaster Committee of the County Assembly of Mombasa, and that all warning letters to that effect arising from an earlier visit of a committee of the House be withdrawn. The Committee recommends that the Department in charge of County fire fighting services should urgently find modalities to compensate the fire fighters for working beyond the official normal working hours. This should be done either through cash or off days to the officers. The Committee also recommends that Kshs. 1,000/= risk allowance to the officers should be reviewed upwards in order to motivate the officers who are undertaking an important service to the County residents. The Committee recommends that the County government should explore modalities to improve on the officers access to medical care considering that they worked in very risky and hazardous environments. The Committee also recommends that thorough investigations be undertaken by the Lands department with regard to the encroachment of lands belonging to three fire stations in the County. The renting by IEBC of offices previously belonging to the fire station at Changamwe be investigated and a way forward be given. That an engagement forum between the Committee members and the leadership of fire stations be undertaken with a view to further engage and come up with tangible strategies and proposals on the way forward with regard to disaster management and fight fighting issues in the County. On 21st November, 2016 the Committee invited the Director of Inspectorate and we had a meeting on conditions of all fire stations and he had informed the committee members that he wrote to the Public Service Board on the employment of 50 staff and drivers due to the shortage of staff to the fire department.",
