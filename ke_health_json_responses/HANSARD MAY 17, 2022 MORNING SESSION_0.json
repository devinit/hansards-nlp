Lack of an approved Spatial Plan is a hindrance to service provision. The Spatial Plan seeks to address historical skewed land rates, zoning, controlled development, and mitigating urban sprawl. It also addresses issues of mushrooming of slums, lack of an elaborate Spatial Plan leading to continued bad practices, and the need for dams to cope with water scarcity during dry spells."
